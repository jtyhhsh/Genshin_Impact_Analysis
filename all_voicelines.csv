Name,Topic,Voice Line
Albedo,Hello,"I am Albedo, Chief Alchemist of the Knights of Favonius. You carry the aura of the stars, interesting... I would like to study you, if you do not mind. I'm certain we will have many opportunities to be alone in the future."
Albedo,Chat: Still Life,What a view... How about a quick break so I can sketch this beautiful scenery?
Albedo,Chat: Investigation,"""The truth of this world""... *sigh* What could it be?"
Albedo,Chat: Reminiscing,"Going out into the world and investigating, turning the ""unknown"" into the ""known."" ...Ahhh, I missed this feeling."
Albedo,When It Rains,"The soil is moist, ideal for collecting the roots of Boom Blossoms. No please, allow me to handle this."
Albedo,When It Snows,Master...
Albedo,When the Sun Is Out,"Ample light... active biological organisms... Yes, this is a good place to sketch."
Albedo,Good Morning,Good morning. Are we going to search for ancient relics today?
Albedo,Good Afternoon,"Good afternoon. I heard your footsteps. My, it certainly is lively outside of the workshop."
Albedo,Good Evening,*sigh* It's gotten quiet outside...
Albedo,Good Night,"Good night, you go ahead and rest. I will just finish one last experiment before bed... If you are interested in the results, I can discuss them with you tomorrow."
Albedo,About Albedo: Genius,"Genius? ...A number of people call me that. But I don't think I'm any ""genius."
Albedo,About Albedo: Socializing,"Relationships are... quite troublesome. Once you establish a relation with someone, you must continue to maintain it; if you lose contact, you must reestablish the relation. This taxing cycle requires a lot of time..."
Albedo,About Us: Experiments,"You... want to accompany me while I experiment? I'm honored.Oh, don't be nervous. My experiments may be dangerous, but no one gets hurt... most of the time."
Albedo,About Us: Assistant Friendship Lv. 6,"Would you oblige me by serving as my assistant? After observing so many experiments, you surely know a good deal about alchemy by now. Relax, we will work together. I don't think you will have any problems. I have faith in my ability to instruct you, and even more faith in your exceptional talents."
Albedo,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"My Vision? Ah, that's nothing more than a tool to aid in my experiments, no different from a beaker or crucible. The one thing about it that really intrigues me is the principle behind how it works... One day, I will uncover its secrets, it's only a matter of time."
Albedo,Something to Share Friendship Lv. 4,"There's something I've always wanted to ask you, but feared rejection and disappointment...Eh-hem... I am very interested in your little floating companion. May I borrow her to investigate for a short while?"
Albedo,Interesting Things,"You would like to know more about petrified trees? Erm... Actually, the petrified trees you have come across in domains aren't that ancient. Truly ancient trees usually grow to around one or two miles in height. Oh, and there's a kind of large spider that lives around their roots — if you tie one up in cape jasmine and lemongrass and sprinkle on some cardamom, smoke it for a few hours — you get a fragrant taste that's simply... unforgettable."
Albedo,About Family Friendship Lv. 6,"Family? Although Alice has always asked me to call her mother.... when I think of the idea of ""family"", my master comes to mind first. My earliest memories in life are of going on adventures with her. She taught me the art of alchemy and much knowledge about the world. Perhaps... even the words ""family"" and ""master"" are incapable of fully expressing her meaning to me."
Albedo,About Sucrose: Direction Friendship Lv. 4,"Sucrose? I think I more or less understand why she is so dedicated to her research in bio-alchemy... Either way, I'm happy to see her succeed more and more in her endeavors."
Albedo,About Sucrose: Habits Friendship Lv. 5,"Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research. For example, I have told her numerous times to just call me ""Albedo"" since we are about the same age, but she insists on addressing me in an excessively formal manner. ...Whatever she prefers, I guess."
Albedo,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,Lisa? I always am impressed by the valuable perspectives she brings to discussions. But is a person with her talents satisfied with such a basic occupation as librarian? There must be some hidden reason for this.
Albedo,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Indeed, I view Klee as my younger sister. Whenever she gets herself into some explosive sort of trouble, I can only console myself with the fact that her current destructiveness is nothing compared to that of Miss Alice."
Albedo,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"Jean? She has served exceptionally well as Acting Grand Master, one can even say she is more reliable than Grand Master Varka. Perhaps in our hearts, we all eagerly await the day she can become the official Grand Master herself."
Albedo,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, Xingqiu? I find his written works quite interesting. The Yae Publishing House in Inazuma has been asking that I cooperate with a different author for greater royalties. Hmph, do I seem the type to be swayed by a few extra Mora?"
Albedo,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"Barbara? She's a very earnest Deaconess. I once had the opportunity to sketch her a simple portrait... What happened to the sketch? Ah yes... Albert offered to purchase it, but I rejected his bid and gave it to the Acting Grand Master. Social relations... really require a lot of effort."
Albedo,More About Albedo: I,"Have a question for me? Go ahead, ask. It doesn't take too long to ask a single question, does it? I'm about to begin the final stage of an experiment..."
Albedo,More About Albedo: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Oh, by the way. Did you know that without human manipulation, you would need to harness the power of a sun eight times the size of our own in order to naturally create gold?"
Albedo,More About Albedo: III Friendship Lv. 4,"The time required to sketch portraits closely correlates with one's mood. I could spend half a day sketching Huffman, while I might only need three strokes of the pencil to sketch Kaeya — one for the face, one for the eyepatch string... and one for the eyepatch."
Albedo,More About Albedo: IV Friendship Lv. 5,What do I do besides sketching and research...? I will occasionally read novels from Inazuma and Liyue. They contain many fascinating ideas which can sometimes provide me with unexpected inspirations for my own creations.
Albedo,More About Albedo: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Even now, I find the nigredo processing stage of alchemy passed down by my master to be full of mystery. What did my master want to create using this technique...? My research is far from over, I will require your help to investigate further."
Albedo,Albedo's Hobbies,"Hmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching. At first I saw it simply as a way to better study the structure of living things and materials so as to aid me in my experiments, but it eventually became a hobby of mine. Indeed, it is a very good way to relax."
Albedo,Albedo's Troubles,"There's just never enough time, is there? Even when I remove the most troublesome matters from my schedule, I still can't find enough time for everything."
Albedo,Favorite Food,"I really do enjoy having dessert. How can I put it...? When both physical and mental capacity are spent, high-energy materials further provide a kind of primordial, highly-effective boost."
Albedo,Least Favorite Food,"What food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted. I decided to simply not go to restaurants, although that has also meant I must spend more time preparing my own food..."
Albedo,Receiving a Gift: I,If flavors were colors... this one would be gold.
Albedo,Receiving a Gift: II,"You're willing to spend so much time on improving your cooking, and that's precisely how you're able to make it taste so good."
Albedo,Receiving a Gift: III,This is more than I can manage... maybe we could split it between us?
Albedo,Birthday,"Happy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things. But when an image is transferred onto paper or canvas, the sketch becomes an extension of our memory. We can remember that past feeling when we later look at the sketch."
Albedo,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Nigredo is the first step in alchemy, drawing from primordial forms. As beings who live in this world, we must find our own meaning."
Albedo,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,Albedo is the step in which change begins. Clearing away the excess so we can take on all the knowledge that is available. Would you like to investigate this world with me?
Albedo,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,Rubedo in alchemy refers to the refining of feeling. I feel the refining of my own emotions is also thanks to you.
Albedo,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Citrinitas is the final stage of the alchemical transmutation process. The meaning of the object being transmuted has finally been brought to light, becoming gold and revealing its true value... I too have found my own meaning."
Aloy,Hello,"Aloy here. I don't know this world, but my arrows are sharp and my bow's ready. If your party needs help, I'll do what I can."

Aloy,Good Night,"Night's here. Time to rest, unless we're going on by starlight."
Aloy,About Aloy,"I grew up an outcast, and it wasn't much fun. Even though I'm a stranger here, people are friendlier than the tribe that was supposed to raise me. It's... nice."
Aloy,About Us: Action,"Everything I do is in the service of life, not death. That's why I'm here with you."
Aloy,About Us: Oath Friendship Lv. 6,"An oath seems like a formality. But if you want mine, you've got it."

Aloy,Something to Share,"If I have to share something, it'll be my bow... in the service of people who need the help."
Aloy,Interesting Things,"This land has a past full of secrets, just like my world. I'll uncover all of it, if I have enough time."
Aloy,More About Aloy: I,I'm not much for talking about myself. The mission is what's important.
Aloy,More About Aloy: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I never had parents. But a man named Rost raised me. He was stern, but kind and generous. And he trained me well. I miss him."
Aloy,More About Aloy: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I spent my whole life looking for my mother and never found her, not really. But I found ancient messages from the woman I was... cloned from. It felt like she knew me. And how to inspire me."
Aloy,More About Aloy: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"When I grew up, I didn't have any friends. Later in my travels, I made some. But I left that world before we could grow close. That's why I'm glad to have spent time with you."
Aloy,More About Aloy: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Trust doesn't come easy for me, but I know I can trust you. You're a true friend, and I don't say that often."
Aloy,Aloy's Hobbies,"Not sure if I have a hobby, unless you count reading things from the past. So, history... I guess?"
Aloy,Aloy's Troubles,One world needed saving. Now another. There's never time to rest.
Aloy,Favorite Food,I'm not picky. Anything's better than traveling on an empty stomach.
Aloy,Least Favorite Food,Had an Oseram stew once that was so thick you could pave a road with it. Ugh.
Aloy,Birthday,"Never put much stock in birthdays. Where I come from, it's a time to celebrate your mother, not yourself. Even so, I wish you a, uh... happy day."
Aloy,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"All right. Feels like we're making progress, but we can't stop now."
Aloy,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,Getting better. Getting stronger. Always a good thing.
Aloy,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"No matter how good a hunter you are, you can always get better. Never rest. Never stop learning."
Aloy,Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"When we started out, you were just another stranger in a world I didn't understand. But after everything we've been through, I can say this for certain: My bow is yours, now and always."

Amber,When It Rains: Reminder,"It's raining again... This will hinder our vision, we must remain vigilant!"

Amber,Interesting Things,"Look, there's a pigeon over there! *giggle* I wish I could fly alongside them."
Amber,About Jean: Help Friendship Lv. 4,"After the Grand Master left on his expedition, all the affairs of the Knights of Favonius, both big and small, have been left up to Jean. If only there was more I could do to help her..."
Amber,About Jean: Care Friendship Lv. 4,Jean might still be working? We should invite her for coffee... Let's go.
Amber,About Lisa: Listening to Stories Friendship Lv. 4,"When you have time, we should go see Lisa! Last time I saw her, she was telling me about a story involving a treasure in the Dragonspine area. But, we got cut off before she could finish. I can't wait to hear the rest of her story!"
Amber,About Lisa: Admiration Friendship Lv. 4,"If Lisa's not sleeping, she'll be reading! I don't know how she does it, I wouldn't be able to sit still for that long."
Amber,About Kaeya: Concerns Friendship Lv. 4,...I'm feeling uneasy all of a sudden! Was that Kaeya with you earlier? Did he give you any trouble?
Amber,About Kaeya: Culprit Friendship Lv. 4,"There's something weird-looking about the dandelions in the garden... Hmm, I bet Kaeya had something to do with this!"
Amber,About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm? Bennett... I feel like I've heard that name before... Oh! Yes, he's that hot-blooded guy from the Adventurers' Guild, right! I tend to come across him way out in the wild from time to time, he seems to really love treasure hunting."
Amber,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Klee? She can be a bit cheeky sometimes, but everyone in the Knights of Favonius likes her. Although... I really ought to keep a closer eye on her if I wanna keep her from getting put in confinement by Jean again."
Amber,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you never can quite tell what he's thinking... Who knows what goes on in that mind of his...(Actual Voice-Over: Albedo spends most of his time in his workshop, tinkering away with all of his awesome stuff. But, when you see him in person, you can never quite tell what he's thinking... Not a clue at all...)"
Amber,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"You wanna know about Noelle? She's super resilient. Still, since she's younger than us we should still look out for her.(Actual Voice-Over: You wanna know about Noelle? She's incredibly resilient. Still, as our predecessor, we should do what we can to help her out.)"
Amber,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,Eula is a great friend of mine! You just need to get used to her sense of humor and you'll get along fine! The only reason she's misunderstood by so many people is her family name. How can I get them to see her for who she really is?
Amber,"About Collei Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","Collei wrote to me saying that her Eleazar has been completely cured... I'm so happy for her! I wish I could fly to her side right now and give her the biggest hug! She also said she misses everyone in Mondstadt, and that once she's ready, she'll come visit us in person and tell us all about her progress... Oh, it would be great if she could make it in time for the next Ludi Harpastum. Aaah I can't wait to see her again!"
Amber,About Mika Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh! Mika's a veteran of Eula's team. When he first arrived, it was always ""Yes, Commander!"" every time he spoke to me — I guess it must have been because he saw how close I was with Eula. But then, even after I told him I was actually an Outrider, he still called me ""Ma'am""... It was so embarrassing. We have completely different responsibilities, after all. I definitely could never match his expertise in cartography."
Amber,More About Amber: I,"I'm a pro at hunting, you know! How about I show you some of my skills? Or even better... how about a little competition?"
Amber,More About Amber: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I'll share my ultimate Gliding Champion secret with you! The most important thing to remember, is to have courage!"

Amber,Amber's Hobbies,"Baron Bunny, today is another squeaky clean day!"

Amber,Favorite Food,Jean makes the most amazing cup of coffee! You'll have to try it sometime.
Amber,Least Favorite Food,"I can handle anything and everything! As long as it isn't cold Wolfhook juice... Ugh, yuck..."
Amber,Receiving a Gift: I,"Wow! This is delicious, you're an amazing cook!"
Amber,Receiving a Gift: II,I wish I was as good at cooking as you...
Amber,Receiving a Gift: III,"Uh, I'm just not used to this taste, sorry! Nothing to do with you of course!"

I'll respond to whichever one you choose, I promise. Hehe, you're welcome."
Arataki Itto,Chat: Itto's Here,"Arataki ""Numero Uno"" Itto, here in the flesh! Hahaha... *cough*"
Arataki Itto,Chat: Snacks,"Best flavor in the world? The sweet, sweet taste of victory. And that's why I've never spent a single Mora on any of my snacks — I've won 'em all fair and square... That's right."
Arataki Itto,Chat: Beetle Fighting,"Don't underestimate the beetle — they can be some of the toughest little guys around! Yes you can, yes you can— Wanna know what's on this beetle's diet? Sweat and tears, that's what! That's how it gets stronger... I think we can all learn somethin' from that!"
Arataki Itto,When It Rains,"Pff, real men don't carry umbrellas... Oh boy, wow, it's really starting to pick up. Uh quick, c'mon, get yours out! C'mon, quick, quick, quick!"
Arataki Itto,When Thunder Strikes,"Hey! Raiden Shogun, is that you? Well guess what — you're not the boss of me. Uh-huh, that's right, you heard me! Go ahead, strike me down!"
Arataki Itto,When It Snows,"Alright, it's time for a snowball fight! You're never gonna win, though, I... Ha, ah... Ah-choo!!! Whew."
Arataki Itto,When the Sun Is Out,"The sky is clear and the sun is shining... Time to get the Onikabuto out for some training! C'mon little guy, let's go!"
Arataki Itto,When the Wind Is Blowing,Bottom line: Never let the wind get to you. Especially when you've got a killer hairstyle like mine. Oh yeah!
Arataki Itto,Good Morning,"Morning, sunshine! Hey, uh... So listen, I'm fresh out of Mora... again. But hey, who needs some lousy job when we can just go find somewhere fun to hang out! Haha, whaddya say?"
Arataki Itto,Good Afternoon,"Now that we've had some grub, why don't we go find somewhere to kick it for a while? Hanamizaka? Nah, boring. Tenryou Commission... No, no, no... Ah, forget it, let's go hang around Ritou!"
Arataki Itto,Good Evening,"Shh! You hear that? *gasp* Oh no... it's a ghost, RUN!!! ... Haha, psyche! Ah, I got you good there! ... I got you, didn't I?"
Arataki Itto,Good Night...,"If you're tired, go ahead and call it a night. Hmm? Me? Oh, don't worry... I sleep with my eyes open... Haha... Literally."
Arataki Itto,About Itto: Getting a Real Job,"Oh, so they're saying I can't hold down a real job, huh? Well! Hahaha! Sorry to break it to ya, but I'm a delinquent. That means it's my job to not have a real job, and if anyone's got a problem with that... Who's got a problem with that, huh? You got a problem with that!? You got a problem with— *coughing* Sorry. Got a little worked up there. Where was I? Ah yeah, so work isn't really my thing, but don't worry — I don't rob or steal or anything like that. When I'm really runnin' low on funds, I just take the odd job here and there to make ends meet. You know, like transporting stuff, delivering documents, helping businesses attract customers... Just enough to keep the wolf from the door. Hehe!"
Arataki Itto,About Itto: Oni Friendship Lv. 4,"The oni have been through a lot to get to where we are today, and look at us now — living peacefully alongside the humans. Unfortunately, there's still plenty of people out there who've got a bone to pick with us. Hmm? Change? Oh yeah, things are gonna change, alright! You can count on that! But I'll tell you what, it won't involve any sucking up to the humans on my part, nuh-uh! I'm gonna let my actions do the talkin'. They'll come to respect me eventually."
Arataki Itto,About Us: Cooperation,"Hey, so I always see you running around everywhere doing this and that for other people, but you're not in it for the Mora, are you? No, you're just straight-up lookin' out for your fellow man. I know a true homie when I see one, and no one appreciates a homies' homie more than yours truly. Put it here, partner! You and I are gonna make a great team, I just know it!"
Arataki Itto,About Us: Response Friendship Lv. 6,"You know what, I gotta admit — I respect you, always have. I could really see you as a member of the gang, you know — I mean, you really have what it takes... Whaddya say? I've even come up with a catchy title to tag on after your name, get this: ""The Traveler, 'Second to One'""! Get it? 'Cause y'know, I'm numero uno, you're my number two, and together we're the most powerful duo in the whole friggin' world, baby! Hahaha! Ah... But, uh, all jokes aside, I know you're on some important journey or whatever. So, go ahead! Get out there and do whatcha wanna do! Just remember, the Arataki Gang will always answer your call."
Arataki Itto,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Ugh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions — which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right? But nooo, some class-A jerk in the Tenryou Commission thought it'd be funny to put my Vision right at the very bottom! Ugh... Come on!"
Arataki Itto,Something to Share: Hina,"If you ever have something on your mind, you can always try writing in to ""That's Life"" magazine's advice column. Ms. Hina always manages to come up with an encouraging and heartwarming response for all her readers. Just look at me — I used to be a lost soul, but not anymore, and it's all thanks to her. Oh, that reminds me, I managed to sign up for one of her upcoming meet-and-greets! I've been counting down the days — wish it would go faster..."
Arataki Itto,Something to Share: Horns,"Question for ya! Do my horns look boring once you get used to them? 'Cause, uh, I was thinking of switching up the style, going for a total overhaul, you know? I'm thinking paint them in rainbow stripes and then strap a few Fireflies on for good measure! Eh, eh? I bet that would turn some heads on the streets... like ""Dude, you're rockin' those sweet rainbow horns, man!"" ...Ah, man, this is totally genius! I'm gonna round up the gang and get them working on it ASAP."
Arataki Itto,Interesting Things,"Wanna know the real secret to catching Onikabuto? It's all in the eyeballs. You gotta keep those bad boys squeaky clean at all times, make sure your eyesight's as sharp as a hawk. Trust me, when you're in the middle of a thunderstorm, and the rain's coming down, and the wind's blowing in your face, you gotta watch out, because Lavender Melons and Onikabuto? Well, they can really start to look the same... believe me, I know."
Arataki Itto,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4,"Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like — are you kidding me??? How come he gets his own special ceremony!? Was the hundredth Vision supposed to be, like, stronger than the other ninety-nine, or something? Pff, nah, it can't have been that, 'cause, uh, hello! They would've chosen me if that's what they were going for."
Arataki Itto,About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4,"Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. ""You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs""... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time... Yeah, I guess sometimes it takes a warrior to understand a warrior. When we're playing trading card games or battling beetles, we're always totally on the same wavelength."
Arataki Itto,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmph, she's always showing off her fancy fireworks and toys to the kids. Well, I'm sick of it! Nobody steals my thunder! I'm the one that's supposed to be adored by the kids! Me! That goes for you too, you're siding with me on this, okay... Huh? Whaddya mean, you're not a kid? Eh, details. If you're shorter than me, you're a kid as far as I'm concerned."
Arataki Itto,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome! Who knows how he pulled it off. Hey, now that I think about it, he's from a fallen clan, and I'm from a fallen clan... That kinda makes us equals, haha! Yeah, so next time someone attacks you, it's my turn to block the blade!"
Arataki Itto,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course. 'Cause if she pulls something like that again, this old pain in the neck will be back with a vengeance."
Arataki Itto,About the Lady with Fox Ears Friendship Lv. 4,"I crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!"
Arataki Itto,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4 The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia,"You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken! Heh, we'll see what she thinks of that."
Arataki Itto,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit. Also, he gives off this vibe that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, almost as if he understands my innermost feelings... I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird."
Arataki Itto,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare."
Arataki Itto,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too! What's up with that? I mean, a tanuki's what she's going for, right? Sheesh, talk about getting your fur all ruffled over nothing..."
Arataki Itto,More About Itto: I,"I know what you're thinking: ""I don't see it — how did this guy get to become the boss of the Arataki Gang on the back of beetle fighting and trading card games?"" Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?"
Arataki Itto,More About Itto: II Friendship Lv. 3,"People in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: ""Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!"" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster. I've gotta fix this, for every oni out there! We're innocent, people! Quit trying to ward us off and drive us out every time there's a minor life event!"
Arataki Itto,More About Itto: III Friendship Lv. 4,"In a... ""attempt""... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax! Ugh, they have no idea who the bad guys are here!"
Arataki Itto,More About Itto: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"In the Arataki Gang, we're proud to welcome people who've experienced adversity in their lives. Don't listen to the people who call us freaks, or weirdos. Every member of my gang is like family to me, and they all feel the same way. Whatever happens, the gang will face it together — both the highs and the lows."
Arataki Itto,"More About Itto: V Friendship Lv. 6 Rise Up, Golden Soul","I gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch! You go to sacrifice yourself, I'll stand right in your way!"
Arataki Itto,Itto's Hobbies,"Beetle fighting, trading card games, spinning tops, kendama, hide-and-seek, you name it, I can play it! Whaddya say, pick one and we'll have a little contest? Just make sure you're ready to get thrashed! Hahaha!"
Arataki Itto,Itto's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"Granny Oni isn't an oni at all... In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in. If people have got a problem with me, fine, I don't care what other people think anyway... *sigh* But I wish people wouldn't go after her because of me."
Arataki Itto,Favorite Food,"Lollipops are pretty much the best things ever. The candy tastes awesome, but also, it looks really cool just having a stick hanging out of your mouth. It gives me, like... a real punk kind of vibe. Here, you try it!"
Arataki Itto,Least Favorite Food,"Uh, well I am an oni! So there's nothing I hate more than beans. Soybeans, Mung Beans, whatever, I hate 'em all. Just touching one is enough to set off my allergies, let alone eating them. We have to get people to resist this constant urge to throw beans everywhere!"
Arataki Itto,Receiving a Gift: I,"Hahahahahahahaha! Mm, mm, mm! I haven't eaten somethin' this good in three whole years!"
Arataki Itto,Receiving a Gift: II,"Fine! I'll let you treat me to a meal today, but know that the Arataki Gang always pays its debts."
Arataki Itto,Receiving a Gift: III,"Hey, are you sure you ain't trying to poison me!? Ah!"
Arataki Itto,Birthday,"Today's an important day. I had to send the gang away, otherwise they'd be accusing me of favoritism. Here, take a look at this. I got you the greatest birthday gift combo ever! One top-grade Onikabuto — I'll have you know it took me three whole days and nights to catch this bad boy — one out-of-print collectible trading card that took me 300 rounds to get my hands on, and finally, a birthday song performance performed personally by yours truly! Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Biiiirthday dear Traveler, Happy Birthday to youuuu!"
Arataki Itto,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Now that's what I'm talking about, baby! Woo-haha! Better look out, I'm way stronger now!"
Arataki Itto,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Ah yeah, this is gonna do wonders for my win ratio!"
Arataki Itto,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Feel the power, baby! Wanna see me smash a boulder?"
Arataki Itto,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I think ""Numero Uno"" just went from nickname to reality, boom! Haha! Hey, but just because I made it to the top doesn't mean I'm gonna forget all the things you've done for me, okay? I've still got your back, anytime, anywhere."
Barbara,Hello,"Tada! *giggles* Barbara is here~ Leave the healing to me, I will not disappoint you!"
Barbara,Chat: Sleepiness,*yawn* All this standing around is making me so sleepy...
Barbara,Chat: Encouragement,"Everyone is working super hard, we should be too!"
Barbara,Chat: Keeping One Refreshed,"Are you tired? Try my new spicy energy drink, I'm sure it'll wake you up!"
Barbara,When It Rains,"Don't stay out in the rain for too long, you'll catch a cold!"
Barbara,When Thunder Strikes,Whoa!
Barbara,When It Snows,"Ooh, snowflakes! Look at them dance!"
Barbara,When the Sun Is Out,This weather is so amazing! I could burst into song.
Barbara,When the Wind Is Blowing,Don't worry! I will not... be blown away!

Barbara,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,Everyone has their own desires. To bring together and fulfill those desires and make everyone happy — this is the purpose my Archon has bestowed upon me.
Barbara,Something to Share,"I could never get bored of the breathtakingly beautiful nature that surrounds Mondstadt. I've heard that there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City. I just need to save up a little more, and... What's that? You want to know what I'm saving up for? *chuckles* That's my little secret."
Barbara,Interesting Things,"Sunflowers always face the sun. They're so bright. In fact, my mother sent me a sunflower-style dress... I wonder when I'll finally get to wear it on stage?"
Barbara,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,Acting Grand Master... Leader of the Knights of Favonius... Everyone seems to like her a lot. Oh? Me? I... Of course I have nothing but admiration for her!
Barbara,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"I always take good care of Lisa. If she ever wants to become a star, she'll have my unconditional support, I'll cheer at the top of my lungs until my voice goes hoarse... Hmm, that might scare off her other fans though..."
Barbara,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,I've seen Amber rushing out of Mondstadt on a mission countless times. Being an Outrider doesn't look easy.
Barbara,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, Master Diluc? Last time, when I was performing at Angel's Share, he kept frowning... Maybe he doesn't like my singing?"
Barbara,About Venti Friendship Lv. 4,Venti's voice is amazing! But the songs he sings and the ones I'm good at are very different. I tried to learn them but... the melodies are just so complicated.
Barbara,About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4,"Bennett always comes to the Cathedral covered in scrapes and bruises... Though it clearly never bothers him a bit, given the big grin he always has on his face. He really should take better care of himself."
Barbara,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"My father left on the expedition with Grand Master Varka... I hope they are okay. Oh, what am I worried about? The Grand Master is none other than the Knight of Boreas, of course they will be fine! Still, I will be sure to pray for their safe return."
Barbara,About Rosaria Friendship Lv. 4,"Sister Rosaria is hard to get to know, especially given she never joins in on prayers, but... Oh, I'm sure she believes in the Anemo Archon! Although, I still don't really have the courage to try to talk to her..."
Barbara,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"Noelle is just the cutest! She's so kind and patient, you just feel totally relaxed when you're around her. ...Oh yeah, and she makes the tastiest snacks! Best part is, they're also healthy. Tee-hee!"
Barbara,More About Barbara: I,"Knights look so cool when they swing their sword in combat! Don't you think so? I tried using a sword before but... *sigh* Uh, let's just say I have zero talent with a sword."
Barbara,More About Barbara: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I want to heal everyone. This simple thought was all the motivation I needed to become a Deaconess. As long as I'm able to help everyone, I'll be content."
Barbara,More About Barbara: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Being an idol, I learned from Alice that ""A true idol should always try to heal the soul of the people..."" Yes, I completely agree."
Barbara,More About Barbara: IV Friendship Lv. 5,I'm doing my best everyday... I hope my efforts earn the trust of the people of Mondstadt.
Barbara,More About Barbara: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Every time I get on stage I always start to doubt myself — can I really heal every person in Mondstadt? But I look at you now, and I feel that as long as we keep marching forward, maybe one day I might just— Huh? I've already healed you? Well, one's not enough! I've already healed a lot of people? I suppose..."
Barbara,Barbara's Hobbies,The smiles on the faces of the people I've helped keeps me going.
Barbara,Barbara's Troubles,"My companions keep getting injured, but I'm unable to share the burden of their pain. The only thing I can do is my absolute very best to heal their wounds! I'll make sure that everyone is healthy."

Beidou,Hello,"I'm Beidou. You've heard of my ship, The Crux, and its crew? If you too love adventure, then join me. I've got your back."
Beidou,Chat: Sparring,"If you ever want to trade tactics, I'm always ready."
Beidou,Chat: Drinking,Ah! A cold beer after a hard day's work... Nothing like it!
Beidou,Chat: Land,It's hard to remain on dry land for so long. Can never seem to quite get my land legs back.
Beidou,When It Rains,"When stuck on a deserted island, rain is a precious source of drinking water. There's no need for it now though."
Beidou,When Thunder Strikes,"Hey, it's just a little lightning. No need to fear it on the open ocean, so there's even less need to fear it on dry land."
Beidou,When It's Windy,This weather would be great for setting sail.
Beidou,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Wind's picking up. If sand gets in your eyes, be sure not to rub them."
Beidou,Good Morning,"Yo, good morning. I'm about to head off, coming with me?"
Beidou,Good Afternoon,"Let's get Xiangling to whip us up something for lunch. Believe me, a hot meal from her is far better than the salted fish we eat out at sea."
Beidou,Good Evening,"Alright, I'm off for a drink. Hahaha, no one willing to sell you a proper drink, huh? Perhaps I can..."
Beidou,Good Night,"Time moves quickly. Haha, go, may the wind be at your back."
Beidou,About Beidou,"We're setting sail! Men, to your posts! A new adventure is about to begin!"
Beidou,About Us: Titles,"I'm the captain, so you can be my first mate! Deal? Ha? Such names are too outdated for you huh? We'll call each other whatever you wish then."
Beidou,About Us: Eye for People Friendship Lv. 6,"I tend to be a good judge of character. When you've learned to read the open ocean, reading people is a cinch. Haha, and that's how I knew you're the good sort the second I laid eyes on ya!"
Beidou,About Us: Choices Friendship Lv. 6,"I chose you as my crewmate, as my comrade on the sea. It gives me great pride to be able to say that."
Beidou,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"To those that don't have a Vision, it must seem that those with Visions are like flagships from the Archons to follow. As such, I make sure to fly my flag with pride. That is my motivation."
Beidou,Something to Share,"At a loss? When you don't know what to do, just take the first step. The rest will figure itself out naturally."
Beidou,Interesting Things,"Every time I return from a long journey and I see the lapis gledes, I'm reminded that I'm almost home. The scenery out on the open ocean gets familiar real quick. Sure, they're birds of prey, but seeing them fly so freely is heart-warming."
Beidou,About Ningguang: Liyue Qixing Friendship Lv. 4,"Ningguang eh? As far as Liyue Qixing is concerned, she seems to be doing a good job. But for me, my responsibility lies with my ship and my men, and not with Liyue Qixing."
Beidou,About Ningguang: Attitudes Friendship Lv. 4,"Ningguang is never really one to speak frankly, but she has been very direct with her criticism of me in the past. Haha... But hey, whether she likes me or hates me is her choice, nothing I can do to sway her."
Beidou,About Xiangling: Culinary Skills Friendship Lv. 4,"When we're out on the open ocean, the one thing we do all miss is Xiangling's cooking. When spirits are low, just thinking of her fried jueyun chili, bursting with flavor... It gives everyone just that little extra kick."
Beidou,About Xiangling: Food Tasting Friendship Lv. 4,"Xiangling huh? She sometimes uses some... interesting ingredients in her dishes to bring about some, ah... intriguing flavors. Though... there's no way she can improve without having someone to taste-test — a role that I am more than happy to fill."
Beidou,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"You mean the gentleman from Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? My men sometimes speak of the rumors surrounding him — he sounds interesting. Yes, if I get the chance I'd like to meet him someday."
Beidou,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4,"One year on the eve of the Lantern Rite, we ran into a storm as we were returning to port. Try as we did, we only made it back to Liyue Harbor in the dead of night, long after the lanterns had all been released. As I looked towards Guyun Stone Forest, I saw an adeptus, floating in the air, in the form of what appeared to be a young boy. I guess it is like the legends say — there really must be those that watch over Liyue, even if they cannot be seen."
Beidou,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Privately, Ganyu and I get on like a house on fire! But as you know, she's the secretary to the Liyue Qixing... and I'm not exactly in their good books right now! Doesn't bother me, but I wouldn't want to put Ganyu in a difficult position. So just keep what I said between us, yeah?"
Beidou,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,"She's got a great personality, that one! The guys in the crew love that rock and roll of hers. Me? We have common ground, just... not when it comes to taste in music."
Beidou,About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4,"Yaoyao always comes on board to play when we're in the harbor. Trouble is, when it's time for her to go she gives you the puppy eyes, and no one has the heart to send her away... Means we're always cutting it quite close by the time we manage to set sail."
Beidou,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Kazuha? That scallywag actually blocked a strike from the Raiden Shogun outside Tenshukaku! Easier said than done... After the battle he came to the Crux Fleet — said he'd voyage with us a while longer. I was more than happy to oblige. If the day comes when he decides to set off again by himself on the next stage of his journey, I'll send him off with a drink, haha..."
Beidou,More About Beidou: I,"Before you step foot on The Alcor, you need to answer one question. When the sea is full of perils — why is it that you still wish to come aboard my ship?"
Beidou,More About Beidou: II Friendship Lv. 3,"You want to know of my legendary tales? Hahaha, that's just my men exaggerating, adding in their own little details. Although, if you were to ask me if I'm afraid of what monsters lurk in the deep, I'd tell you I have no fear of them."
Beidou,More About Beidou: III Friendship Lv. 4,"You wanna know why I help the common folk? Why not? Everyone has their low points in life. I don't really do anything, other than help steer those who are truly lost towards a brighter future."
Beidou,More About Beidou: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I've been through some hard times. When I was a child we had little money, so nothing to eat, and lived for years by stealing fruit off of people's trees. Even after I got my own ship, I was cast out by pompous merchants. But me telling you such stories is merely for your amusement. I have no intention of making you live through it too."
Beidou,More About Beidou: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I have many brothers that sail with me. I have asked, and remember, why each and every one of them came on board. You, however, are special. I know you still have your own things to deal with, and as such, I won't try to rope you into coming onboard permanently. But remember, there is always a place for you onboard The Alcor."
Beidou,Beidou's Hobbies,"My hobbies...? Lemme think... Well, there's adventure, sailing, making friends, drinking, eating... more than I can count on one hand."
Beidou,Beidou's Troubles,"If you can change something, change it. If you can't, don't waste time thinking about it. That's how I go about things. But really, if you get stuck, come find me. I'll help you deal with it."
Beidou,Favorite Food,"I like food with robust flavors. Spicy fried meat or spicy tofu are my favorites. Sitting down to a big hearty meal together, where everyone can fill their bellies — now that's when things get lively! Haha, alright, alright, all this talk is making me hungry!"
Beidou,Least Favorite Food,"I'm not a fan of anything cold, it does nothing to fire up my appetite. I'd rather fry up a few fish."
Beidou,Receiving a Gift: I,"Tastes good, I like it! Mind giving me a bowl of rice with this?"
Beidou,Receiving a Gift: II,"Your cooking skills aren't bad at all, eating your food has me in a good mood."
Beidou,Receiving a Gift: III,"You know, at the end of the day, food is food, and that's fine by me."
Beidou,Birthday,"Come, board my ship. I've gathered the crew. The food and drink are all prepared. Today is your birthday, so you are the captain. Haha, so: Where should we set sail?"
Beidou,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Great! I feel much stronger.
Beidou,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,We're making progress. Let's crack open a bottle to celebrate!
Beidou,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,A prime example! It is an honor to have you aboard. I need to keep up if I'm to keep the respect of my crew.
Beidou,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"After all this training, I feel like I'm finally at my best. Thank you... But please, I'd still like for you to keep me on my toes."
Bennett,Hello,"This is your team? Cool... I like the vibe. I'm Bennett, leader of Benny's Adventure Team. Any chance we can team up? Please?"
Bennett,Chat: Treasures,Let's go find some treasure!
Bennett,Chat: Adventures,"No one's joined me on an adventure in ages. C'mon, let's go!"
Bennett,Chat: Self-Deprecation,"""Good things come to those who don't wait around!"" That's what they say, anyway. Knowing my luck, the opposite is probably true for me..."
Bennett,When It Rains,It always rains when I go on an adventure.
Bennett,When Thunder Strikes,"Don't stand too close to me, or you might get hit by lightning too."
Bennett,When the Sun Is Out,"Weather's not bad today... Oh crud, I jinxed it! Now it's bound to rain."
Bennett,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Careful! In this kind of wind, it's easy to get hit in the head by flying rocks."
Bennett,Good Morning,Morning! Where's the adventure at today?
Bennett,Good Afternoon,"I brought a sandwich. You want some? I'll give you hal- *choking* *spluttering* ...Phew. Sorry, nearly choked to death there!"
Bennett,Good Evening,"Hey, wanna go talk to my dads for a bit? They tell the best adventure stories!"
Bennett,Good Night,You're headed off? Cool. It was awesome adventuring with you. We should totally do it again!
Bennett,About Bennett: Adventure Team,"I'm the leader of Benny's Adventure Team — a rising star in the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild! ...Where are the others? Ah, haha, they're all on leave right now."
Bennett,About Bennett: Bad Luck,"Eh, it's not as bad as you've heard! Everyone falls into a trapper's pit or gets hit on the head by a falling tree now and then, right?"
Bennett,About Us: Teammates,"Hahaha, you wish! Benny's Adventure Team has had no vacancies in ages... I mean, you must be spoiled for choice, right? Why'd you wanna join the unluckiest adventurer alive, anyway?"
Bennett,About Us: Division of Labor Friendship Lv. 6,"From now on, I'll distract the monsters and set off the traps while you grab the treasure. Sound good? ...You don't like it? Oh — don't worry about me getting injured! It's what I'm best at... And for you, it would be my pleasure!"
Bennett,About Us: Dangerous Places Friendship Lv. 6,"I think I get why you teamed up with me now. It's 'cause we're the same, you and I — we both like that adrenaline rush you get from being in dangerous situations. That's what makes adventuring so addictive!"
Bennett,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Getting recognized by the gods was the last thing I expected, seeing as how I'm so unlucky all the time. But if the gods haven't given up on me, I guess that means I shouldn't give up on me either."
Bennett,Something to Share,"Do you wanna come and see the view of Mondstadt from above some time? It's real pretty at night, when the city's all lit up and you can see the moon reflected on Cider Lake... Huh? From where? Haha, well, there was this one time when I got picked up by a tornado and ended up on this cliff way up high— Not interested? Oh, okay then, never mind."
Bennett,Interesting Things,"I actually quite like cabbage. It's not much to look at, but you can't imagine a world without it. You can grow it anywhere, it goes with everything, and the flavor never gets in the way. I dunno, there's something... nice about being ordinary."
Bennett,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"She's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after an adventure goes south — it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team..."
Bennett,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"She's a cute kid... but I have to keep my distance. Whenever she plays with me, her bombs always end up going off... It's not so much me I'm worried about, it would just be awful if something happened to Klee. The Knights of Favonius would never forgive me, that's for sure."
Bennett,About Fischl Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh yeah, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung from the world beyond! She's amazing. I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety. Her home world sounds like a dangerous place, for sure."
Bennett,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"I keep meaning to ask Master Jean for some help with the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild, but I don't know how to go about it. The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?"
Bennett,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"He's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are."
Bennett,About Razor Friendship Lv. 4,"Wolvendom guy! Looks a little on the feral side... doesn't talk much... but he's alright! We both love eating meat, so we got that in common. I sometimes cook some meat for him, and he teaches me how wolves communicate in return. Haha! You should join us next time!"
Bennett,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?"
Bennett,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"Noelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking. But somehow she's still a maid — the Knights of Favonius still haven't made her a knight. It's a shame, don't you think? Boy, if she switched to the Adventurers' Guild, she'd easily be one of the best there is."
Bennett,More About Bennett: I,"Oh... you wanna know about me? Haha, I'm just your average adventurer. 'Cept I'm more unlucky than average. Anyway, I'm nothing compared to you — you're the star of all those legendary tales. What do I got to show for myself?"
Bennett,More About Bennett: II Friendship Lv. 3,"""The dads..."" that's how I refer to all the older adventurers in Mondstadt. Apparently, I was an orphan kid that they rescued from the most perilous situation ever. How cool is that? I have such terrible luck all the time, and yet I was rescued against the odds and survived all this time. It's a miracle if you ask me."
Bennett,More About Bennett: III Friendship Lv. 4,"You've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now. Reason is, I have such bad luck that even the most benign of adventures end up turning into the adventure from hell, and no one wants to come with me... Do you feel the same way?"
Bennett,More About Bennett: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it. But you know what? Maybe it's a good thing. It means I know that whatever luck I do have left is gonna run out sooner rather than later... so I'd better make the most of my life while it lasts. You know, go on plenty of adventures, meet loads of people... I mean, if I didn't live like that, I may never have even met you! Can you imagine? Haha!"
Bennett,More About Bennett: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Time flies! We've been a team for a while now, haven't we? Anyway, I have a dream I wanna tell you about. Once the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild becomes the biggest branch in Teyvat, I wanna go adventuring all over the whole world! Benny's Adventure Team will be the greatest adventure team there ever was, because you and me are the greatest adventurers! ...""Since when?"" Uh... I don't remember exactly when you signed onto Benny's Adventure Team. But whatever, it's just details, right?"
Bennett,Bennett's Hobbies,"I like all kinds of things, but most of all, I like adventures! One day I'm gonna find the most valuable treasure in the whole world, and then my dads can have a better life... and the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild will be back in business!"
Bennett,Bennett's Troubles,"Hmm... Well, if you really wanna know... When I have a bad day, I feel a bit glum. Like, it sucks when I come back empty-handed from an adventure, or when one of my dads' old injuries start acting up. But they're just small things really, after a good night's sleep I forget all about them. New day, new start! Haha!"
Bennett,Favorite Food,"Meat! Meat is the best sustenance there is. Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Steaks, and Sweet Madames are all my specialties. You won't go hungry if you come adventuring with me, that's for sure!"
Bennett,Least Favorite Food,"You can't really afford to be picky as an adventurer. That said, I can't really handle spicy food. I find it hard to breathe after eating Jueyun Chilis, like the spice went right into my lungs. And there's no avoiding the diarrhea afterward... It's the devil's fruit, I say. Who knows where it came from?"
Bennett,Receiving a Gift: I,"Whoa, lucky me! Haha... Oh wait! Does that mean I just used all of my good luck for today...?"
Bennett,Receiving a Gift: II,"Literally everything you cook ends up tasting amazing. Ha, you're awesome!"
Bennett,Receiving a Gift: III,Oh no... my stomach hurts...
Bennett,Birthday,"Happy birthday! Best of luck in the year ahead. Don't worry, bad luck isn't contagious! As long as I'm around, it'll be drawn to me and not you, so you're safe."
Bennett,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"I feel stronger in every sense! Just as unlucky as ever, though. Hahaha."
Bennett,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"I'm catching up with you, Traveler! One step at a time."
Bennett,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Wow, check out all this power! How can I repay you, though? Hmm... Oh yeah! I know this Domain where there's a priceless treasure hidden somewhere inside! Let's go hit it up!"
Bennett,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Thanks to your help, I should finally be able to keep everyone safe now. Hopefully, people's opinions of me will start to change. Once the unluckiest guy alive, with a million cuts and bruises to show it. Now, a dependable adventurer at long last! ...Heh, well, I—I can hope."
Candace,Hello,"Welcome, weary Traveler from afar. Nights in the desert are cruel. You should rest here tonight. Sleep soundly, and know that I am watching over you."
Candace,Chat: Spear and Shield,A shield is not enough to protect the most important things. That's why I must also wield a spear.
Candace,Chat: Life,"Peace and good health should be enjoyed by all... If I can provide everyone with a life such as this, I will be content."
Candace,Chat: Wishes,"I will always seek to protect the things that are most important, no matter what it takes... even when it looks futile."
Candace,When It Rains,"Stay warm, or you'll catch a cold."
Candace,When Thunder Strikes,The thunder rumbles — does it scare you?
Candace,When It Snows,"This strange powder, it is... fine, like sand, but white as the clouds, and cold as ice..."
Candace,When the Wind Is Blowing,"In the desert, a strong gale like this will create a sandstorm, so it's always a good idea to stay alert."
Candace,In the Desert,"I am right by your side. But if you're still nervous, just take my hand."
Candace,Good Morning,"Good morning, Traveler. Did you sleep soundly last night?"
Candace,Good Afternoon,"It's already noon. The golden eye of the sky glares down fiercely at this hour... Hehe, we should find some shade and escape its wrath."
Candace,Good Evening,The night sky... that great canopy that descends when the light of day is gone. Who knows how many untold secrets it conceals...
Candace,Good Night,"Yes, it's time to rest. You should sleep. Me? It's still much too early. The night is beautiful, but it's also full of danger... I must keep watch, for your sake."
Candace,About Candace: Eye Color,"...Strange? I'm not sure what you mean, both amber and blue are fairly common eye colors, I believe..."
Candace,About Candace: Aaru Village,"Aaru Village is where I was born and grew up. Even back when I was too young to understand anything else about the world, the one thing I knew for sure was that one day, I would take over from my grandfather as sworn protector of our village... Today, I am grateful to now hold this duty. It is what I was born to do."
Candace,About Candace: Parents Friendship Lv. 4,"My father was a scholar from the Akademiya. He originally came to Aaru Village on a research trip, and then he met my mother... As for her, unfortunately I only know what my father has told me. The day I was born, she began her journey into the eternal night..."
Candace,About Us: Hosting Guests King Deshret and the Three Magi,"You will always be an honored guest of Aaru Village, no matter the day or time of your visit. If ever you tire of your journey, know that here, you can always find rest. Aaru Village welcomes you with open arms... as do I."
Candace,About Us: Treasure in the Chest Friendship Lv. 6,"They say that in every person's heart is a precious box, into which they place the things they treasure, so that they may guard them for their entire life. My heart harbors many treasures... Care to guess what those might be?"
Candace,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"When I received my Vision, people in the village kept telling me it was a blessing from Ahmar... but that doesn't matter to me. I swore to protect the village, and I will do it with or without a Vision."
Candace,Something to Share,"I do love spending time in Aaru Village. But each day I spend here is also a reminder that if I ever start to let my guard down... sooner or later, the day may come when I no longer have a life to return to here."
Candace,Interesting Things,"Have you come across Ajilenakh Nuts yet on your journey? They're naturally very sweet, and the villagers make the most delicious candies from them. If you're interested, you should give them a try."
Candace,About Lesser Lord Kusanali Friendship Lv. 4,"Perhaps it is a testament to the Dendro Archon's benevolence that I, a descendant of the Al-Ahmar bloodline, am able to live peacefully on this land. If so, I suppose I am grateful for this much, but... I am first and foremost a child of the desert."
Candace,"About Layla Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","An eccentric girl who always seems to be in a trance...? Yes, I believe I've seen her before — near the Wall of Samiel. I couldn't make sense of what she was saying, nor the calculations she wrote down, but she seemed to be in a much better mood after she'd finished. Perhaps this is her way of relieving stress."
Candace,About Alhaitham Friendship Lv. 4,"A truly unusual scholar, unlike any other I've ever met. He sees and thinks about things in his own unique way... I only hope he never wields his sharp mind against the peace of Aaru Village."
Candace,About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4,"In the past, it was rare to see the Akademiya's General Mahamatra on this side of the Wall of Samiel, but recently he has been showing up here all the time. I believe that the Eremites have some truly terrifying stories to tell about him..."
Candace,About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4,"Whenever Dehya brings any of her Eremites to stay at Aaru Village, she always keeps them on their very best behavior. I have to say, it makes my life a lot easier. Ah, Dehya... She might look like trouble at first, but the truth is that she's really quite adorable."
Candace,More About Candace: I,"You want to know more about me? ...I can't promise you a great story, but if you insist... Okay, let's wait until nightfall. We can sit by the fireside and I'll tell you all you wish to know."
Candace,More About Candace: II Friendship Lv. 3,"We are a people whose god is no longer with us. Lies pose no threat to us... the threat we face is the prospect of no tomorrow. The path before us is paved with barbs, there is pain in every step — yes, we tread forward clinging to a lie, but perhaps... perhaps there is more virtue in this than in selfishly embracing the truth, and death along with it..."
Candace,More About Candace: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Even now, there are those who hold on to a belief that the King Deshret will be resurrected. But it's not possible. The past is but grains of sand, scattered to the four winds. The best we can do is to let go, and leave the wind to carry them to their final resting place."
Candace,More About Candace: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"My shield? Well, according to what people outside the village say, it has the blessing of Bennu. With this shield in hand, all the grains of sand are my eyes and ears, and the desert is ready to do my bidding... Their imaginations can get a little carried away sometimes. But anyway, that aside, the main thing for me is it always works a charm."
Candace,More About Candace: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I'd really love to look into your future with my amber eye, if I could... Something tells me everything would be golden... somewhere between the color of sunlight and honey. A color filled with hope. Your journey will be a smooth road ahead. I give it my blessing."
Candace,Candace's Hobbies,"I always love taking walks in the village. Seeing that all is still well gives me a sense that... if today is just like yesterday, and yesterday is just like all the days before it... things have always been pleasant here, throughout history."
Candace,Candace's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"Every now and then, a few violent thugs make the mistake of trying to disrupt the peace and tranquility of Aaru Village. I do wonder... is chasing them into a monster-infested valley perhaps a little too... merciful? What do you think, do you have any better ideas on how they should be dealt with?"
Candace,Favorite Food,"To me... quantity is more important than taste when it comes to food. Life in the desert uses up more energy than you might think. After a day's work, there's nothing more satisfying than having a filling meal."
Candace,Least Favorite Food,"I don't hate it, but compared to regular meat, eating fish is a real nuisance... Maybe it's because we don't really eat fish here in the desert, but for whatever reason, I'm just not very good at removing all those prickly little bones... This must sound ridiculous to you."
Candace,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm, absolutely delightful! This must have taken a lot of time and effort."
Candace,Receiving a Gift: II,"For someone who spends so much time on the road, your cooking tastes so... homely."
Candace,Receiving a Gift: III,"Maybe my definition of ""edible"" is a little too old-fashioned..."
Candace,Birthday,"Happy birthday! It's amazing to think that you were born on this day, years ago in the past. Do you have a birthday wish? If it involves going somewhere dangerous, let me join you — I'll be your guard. Or if you're looking to rest and revitalize, come to Aaru Village, and I'll serve you the finest meats and drinks we have."
Candace,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,I feel a newfound strength within me... May it help me to be a better protector.
Candace,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"My shield grows sturdier, and my spear sharper. One is an unstoppable force, the other an immovable object... Oh, but... I would never pit these against each other."
Candace,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I learned to wield the spear and shield knowing that I would one day need them, and today I use these skills to protect the village. So perhaps this new strength I now gain in the present is preparing me for trials that lie ahead in the future."
Candace,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I am now capable of venturing ahead of you, and fending off all dangers that would seek to come your way. If you trust me, then I invite you to close your eyes and leave the enemies to me."
Chongyun,Hello,"My name is Chongyun. My family has practiced the art of exorcism in Liyue for many generations. Fate has been generous in allowing my path to cross with that of your distinguished self. ...Oh, no — my services are free of charge!"
Chongyun,Chat: The Art of Exorcism,"Exorcism uses thaumaturgy and martial arts to conquer evil. There are other means to the same end, but they are not the true way."
Chongyun,Chat: Diet,I take my meals cold to quiet the spirit and calm my vital energies. Qingxin-infused water with ice is the most effective.
Chongyun,Chat: Mantras,"""Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be..."" Um... Ugh, I always forget that last part."
Chongyun,When It Rains,There is no purer form of water than rain. It can aid us greatly in the purging of evil.
Chongyun,When Thunder Strikes,"Before the resounding thunder, evil must cower in fear."
Chongyun,When It Snows,"Ah, this weather is delightful."
Chongyun,Good Morning,It is unwise to waste the precious morning hours. Time to train!
Chongyun,Good Afternoon,One's spiritual energies are at their peak at noon. We must take that time to practice.
Chongyun,Good Evening,"As the day winds down and the quiet of evening sets in, the atmosphere is ripe for focusing your mind. There is no better time than this for training."
Chongyun,Good Night,Whew. What a tiring day. You should get some rest. Don't forget what we agreed — we will investigate that haunted house tomorrow.
Chongyun,About Chongyun: Exorcists,"We exorcists have been protectors of Liyue since ancient times, and our techniques have been passed down from generation to generation. Purging evil is second nature to us."
Chongyun,About Chongyun: Commissions,"*sigh* I didn't actually do anything. I just walked into that haunted house, and the problem was resolved... Do you think I should still take payment for this exorcism?"
Chongyun,About Us: Companions,"Your skills are impressive. When you finish with a hilichurl— I mean, an evil spirit, it is surely banished from this world for good. How about we team up?"
Chongyun,About Us: Ghost Stories Friendship Lv. 6,"By now, you must be well acquainted with Liyue's supernatural phenomena. Now, about the evil beings you speak of in lands beyond... I would very much like to see them too."
Chongyun,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions are powerful, but one would be foolish to place blind faith in them. Personally, I trust more in thaumaturgy and martial arts. In the end, one cannot become truly proficient without vigorous training."
Chongyun,Something to Share,"There are rumors abound concerning evil spirits in Liyue, but not all have truth to them. In fact, some strange commissions wind up having nothing to do with them at all."
Chongyun,Interesting Things A New Star Approaches,I have heard there are many strange and rare things sealed within the amber from Mt. Hulao. Could some of them be the fabled demons of which the ancient legends speak? I would love to investigate.
Chongyun,"About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4 Farewell, Archaic Lord","That Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor seems to be quite an incredible man. Just think, common folk might gang up to commit a murder, we exorcists vanquish demons — but he alone buries the bodies of the adepti."
Chongyun,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"I do admire Xingqiu for his devotion to chivalry and his martial arts proficiency. However — I must warn you that he definitely has a mean side, too. If you find that you fall foul of any of his antics, come to me and we'll form a ""Victims of Xingqiu"" alliance. There is strength in numbers."
Chongyun,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4,"The Conqueror of Demons himself has defended Liyue side-by-side with we exorcists for generations, day after day, night after night. I have the utmost respect for Adeptus Xiao. It's just... Why must he be so disparaging toward us? He says our repertoire is lacking and our power is trivial. I'm sorry, but I just can't accept that."
Chongyun,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is a reputable institution that acts with integrity. But whenever I see that cheeky smile that says, ""It's nothing you exorcists need to worry about,"" it just makes my blood boil... Whoa, deep breaths, Chongyun. Stay calm."
Chongyun,About Qiqi Friendship Lv. 4,"She looks like a zombie, but as an exorcist, I feel there's... something different about her. Hmm, her name is also absent from all the praised names I've seen... Where exactly does she fit in among the deities?"
Chongyun,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,"I avoid Xinyan's performances like the plague. That heated atmosphere... Even if you don't intend to get involved, it still... Let's just say that it gets me all hot and bothered."
Chongyun,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"Xiangling's cooking is universally praised, but I personally don't touch any of her spicy dishes. Why? Oh, you know — just, uh... personal preference, that's all. I mean, come on, Mushroom Slime Stew... Does that sound appetizing to you?"
Chongyun,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"The elders in my clan have mentioned her before. The fate of her family... *sigh* It's something we can all sympathize with. I originally thought we would be able to bring back a long-lost relative back into our clan. The elders were overjoyed too, when they heard she was alive — they even prepared gifts for her, and picked an auspicious day for a grand reunion. What we hadn't counted on was that most of the time, she's extremely difficult to track down. Wait a minute, based on our relative positions in the family tree, does that mean I... There's no way I'd have to call her ""Auntie Shenhe""... right?"
Chongyun,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"I met her once, back when I'd just become an exorcist. I'd taken a commission to perform an exorcism in someone's home, and was just leaving at the end when I ran into her. She wrote my name down in a booklet — I guess she just wanted to confirm I wasn't doing anything suspicious... Anyway, it was just that one time, I never saw her again after that.Now that I think about it, it's probably because the sight of me meditating motionless must be pretty boring to watch. Not exactly suspicious."
Chongyun,More About Chongyun: I,"Discipline is everything. Unbridled passion can have disastrous consequences. Trust me, I would know. ...Oh, no no no, not from personal experience, of course. Haha... Uh... I'm just stating my observations from what I've seen in my travels around Liyue."
Chongyun,More About Chongyun: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I was born with something called congenital positivity, meaning I have too much positive energy... Apparently it's so rare it only happens once every thousand generations or so. It means I repel all evil for miles around... *sigh* Actually, that's a bad thing. I must be the only exorcist in history who can't get within ten miles of an evil spirit."
Chongyun,More About Chongyun: III Friendship Lv. 4,"One of the main symptoms of congenital positivity is excess passion, something which has gotten me into many embarrassing situations. In an effort to alleviate these symptoms, I have to abstain from eating chilis and all hot food. I also have to take a parasol with me everywhere, and I avoid listening to rousing music. I wonder, will I ever overcome my condition for good?"
Chongyun,More About Chongyun: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Waiting for evil to show up at the doorstep will get you nowhere — you have to go out and hunt it down. By purging Liyue of evil spirits, I bring peace of mind to people and also broaden my horizons. If an evil spirit ever bothers you, just let me know. I'll come and help you out right away."
Chongyun,More About Chongyun: V Friendship Lv. 6,"To permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist. If that grand day ever comes, I suppose I should be able to consider trying many new things, such as hot springs, Jueyun Chilis, and... partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature. Ugh, what am I doing... Ugh, I shouldn't be dwelling on these things, even thinking about them is too stimulating for me..."
Chongyun,Chongyun's Hobbies,I like listening to Tea Master Liu's stories. His narration really brings the hair-raising tales of the supernatural to life. Why not come with me some time?
Chongyun,Chongyun's Troubles,"After making numerous inquiries and putting in an enormous amount of effort, I finally tracked down the location of an old haunted temple. So I camped out there for four whole days, ready to exorcise the hell out of that place... and nothing happened. Not even the faintest glimpse of an evil spirit. *sigh* Sadly, this is a regular occurrence for me."
Chongyun,Favorite Food,"Nothing makes me happier than sitting down to an authentic Inazuman meal, ingredients imported of course. After training hard all day, the ice-cold freshness of Inazuman cuisine takes the exhaustion away."
Chongyun,Least Favorite Food,Anything piping hot and laden with chilies is an absolute no-go for me. The mere thought of a Jueyun Chili gives me hot flashes.
Chongyun,Receiving a Gift: I,Cold dishes are just to my liking! I'll save some for after my training.
Chongyun,Receiving a Gift: II,"I'm sorry, I know you mean well, but I really need to wait for it to cool off before I eat it."
Chongyun,Receiving a Gift: III,Oh no! Did you put Jueyun Chilis in this?
Chongyun,Birthday,"On the anniversary of your birth, please accept this gift of a flower, made of ice crystals. I carved it myself. If you ever encounter an evil spirit, cast this toward it — the spell I have cast upon it will immediately come into effect and hopefully get you out alive. Also... Happy birthday."
Chongyun,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"We often use these materials for thaumaturgy during exorcisms — I never knew they could be used to purify one's own spirit, too."
Chongyun,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Martial arts and thaumaturgy are alike in that there are always new dimensions to explore. Thanks to your guidance, I can see myself making progress."
Chongyun,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Never before have I fathomed such lofty heights of martial prowess! For eye and hand, man and blade to act in unity... Truly, I have been enlightened."
Chongyun,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"With all the secrets arts that I have learned, my goal of banishing all evil from the world is finally in view. I will never forget how much you have done for me. Maybe now I even have what it takes to face the flames of my positive energy, and see if I can take the heat."
Collei,Hello,"Trainee Forest Ranger Collei, reporting for duty! I will ensure your safe passage through this forest. ...Phew, I think I've finally got that line down! ...I—I didn't get any of it wrong, did I?"
Collei,Chat: Forest Patrol Route Map,"According to today's forest patrol route map... we need to head here first, then make our way over to there... Hmm... There's a loooot of writing..."
Collei,Chat: Status,"Ah, I'm feeling alright today. I'll take the chance to try and get some more done than usual."
Collei,Chat: Memory,"When I don't have much to keep me occupied, old thought patterns start to creep back in, and— Soon as I start talking about it, the flashbacks start..."
Collei,After the Rain,"Even though the rain has stopped, you still need to watch out for puddles. Just like how the past stays in the memory, long after... Ah, ahem, sorry!"
Collei,When Thunder Strikes,"When you hear thunder, it's best practice to stay away from tall trees. Rangers must also be on the lookout for any signs of a forest fire."
Collei,When the Sun Is Out,"The weather's not bad. Let's get some sun! Hehe, after all, it's excellent for your health."
Collei,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Ahh, the wind is perfect. Not too light, not too strong... Hehe, I bet Amber would be itching to test her limits in this weather."
Collei,Good Morning,"Good morning! *yawn* Sorry, I was catching up on my studying again last night..."
Collei,Good Afternoon,It's quite normal to be out until midday on the longer patrol routes. I brought a few extra Pita Pockets — would you like one?
Collei,Good Evening,It's getting dark out. You need to be extra careful if you're going through the forest at this hour.
Collei,Good Night,Are you ready to get some sleep? Okay. The campfire's lit — I'll keep watch tonight.
Collei,About Collei: Forest Ranger,"I wandered the wilderness for quite a long time before arriving in Sumeru, and I've eaten everything out there countless times — edible or not. Since I'm familiar with the wilderness, the work of a Forest Ranger seemed a natural fit for me when I arrived here. If they did courses in wilderness survival, I'm pretty sure I could pass... well, as long as there was no written test."
Collei,About Collei Herself: Cram,"Hmm? You wanna know what it is that I'm studying every day? ...Y—Yes, my master is a brilliant intellectual, but no, he's not teaching me anything heavily academic at the moment. It's, um... heh, ""Basic Literacy in Teyvat""..."
Collei,About Us: Old Friends Song of the Dragon and Freedom,"Amber's mentioned you before in her letters. I can't believe how much has happened in Mondstadt since I was there. Too bad I had to skip the words I didn't know, so I missed out on a lot of details... Oh, but since you're here now, would you be willing to tell me the whole story?"
Collei,About Us: New Friends Friendship Lv. 6,"I used to think that I'd never make a single friend in my whole life, but things changed when I went to Mondstadt... Then after that, I met Master in Sumeru. Now I've met you, too. All in all, I think I've been really lucky."
Collei,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"I never thought there'd come a day where I get my own Vision. In the past, I used to think that the gods only cared about people who were born popular... Um, but I was in a bad place back then. Sorry."
Collei,Something to Share: Skill Names,"Master is always reminding me that practice makes perfect, so I sometimes try reading some light novels to improve my reading ability... Because they're at least easier to read than Master's essays. But recently, I was reading this book where the main character has loads of different skills. Each one has a name, and I didn't know a single word in any of them... Hmm? The title? I think it was, um... ""Onibudou""? Have you read it before?"
Collei,Something to Share: Sealed Power,"Ugh... Here we go again: ""The power sealed within me grows restless""... and ""You'd be wise to stay away from me""... Why are people in Inazuma casually coming out with lines like these all the time? Doesn't it embarrass them when they think back on it later? Aaah... no, it's too cringey. I can't read any more of this!"
Collei,Interesting Things,"Well, there's plants and animals, there's ones you can eat and ones you can't, but beyond that it's all much of a... uh, muchness really? ...Shh, don't tell Master I said that. Although... personally, I guess I quite like trees that have a hollow in it? Especially in those moments where I just want to curl up in a ball and hide away. Everyone must have moments like that, right? ...No?"
Collei,About Tighnari Friendship Lv. 4,"Although Master can be quite stern and is always criticizing adventurers for carelessly eating poisonous mushrooms, he is actually a gentle soul. He's so patient when he tutors me, and he even reads out letters from Mondstadt for me. I've always been very grateful to him."
Collei,About Dori Friendship Lv. 4,"I ran into her once on forest ranger duty. She pulled out a bottle of fruit juice from her bag that looked really tasty, as if she somehow knew I was thirsty... Fortunately, Master was there, and he stopped me from spending all of my hard-earned Mora in a moment of weakness..."
Collei,About Lesser Lord Kusanali Friendship Lv. 4,"The Dendro Archon... When I was a kid, there were so many times when I just wanted to scream out to the gods and ask them why, why did I have to go through so much pain...? *sigh* But, for all I know, maybe the gods feel just as helpless about everything they have to endure as I did back then."
Collei,About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4,"Um... I'd rather not talk about him, if that's okay? Oh, no — the General Mahamatra isn't a bad guy or anything. Matter of fact, I have him to thank for bringing me back from Mondstadt to Sumeru and finding me a safe place to stay. It's just that... whenever I'm reminded of the sealing process just before leaving Mondstadt... ooh... the back of my neck starts hurting again..."
Collei,About Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4,"The General Mahamatra once brought him to our place for a meal. From the moment the fruit arrived on the table, he ranted non-stop about his difficult and stubborn roommate for the entire meal. We didn't get a single word in the whole time. We just nodded along and tried to stifle our laughter. It took a lot of effort."
Collei,About Nilou Friendship Lv. 4,"She seems a little absent-minded. If she ever comes to perform around Gandharva Ville, I'm worried she'll end up wandering off into the forest and getting lost... So I'll have to watch out for her, as a responsible trainee forest ranger should."
Collei,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"Amber is amazing. She's friendly and has tons of enthusiasm, plus she's really brave and always does the right thing... She's the person I admire most of all! She's like a cozy fire that makes everyone around her feel warm. There's no way I'd be where I am today without her... So much time has gone by — I bet she's even more cool and confident than ever these days! Who knows if I'll ever be able to match her."
Collei,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"How's everyone in Mondstadt, are they good? I caused so much trouble back then, I sometimes wonder if I should make some time to go back there and apologize... Hmm, but what if I ran into the Cavalry Captain, and he started teasing me? ...Yeah, there's no rush, maybe I'll leave it a while longer."
Collei,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"After all this time, Lisa still calls me ""Little Collei"" when she writes to me. I feel like by now she... hmm? She calls you ""cutie""? Hahaha... Sorry, I don't mean to laugh, um... but I must say, that makes me feel a lot better."
Collei,About Fischl Friendship Lv. 4,"...""Prinzessin der Verurteilung""? ...Mmm, nope, sorry. I wasn't in Mondstadt for very long, so I didn't hear of her. That name, though... *grimace*... Ahem, nothing."
Collei,More About Collei: I,"You wanna know more about me? If you mean about before I came to Sumeru, then, um... M—Maybe you could write to Amber and ask her about it? Wait wait wait, no, not that. If Kaeya found out, that would be a disaster. What am I saying — of course he'd find out! O—Okay, I'll tell you myself, then. Whew... I'm sorry! Please give me a few days to work up to it..."
Collei,More About Collei: II Friendship Lv. 3,"When I ended up in Mondstadt, I said a lot of things to Amber and the others that I shouldn't have. I still feel ashamed whenever I think about it... How could I talk like that to people who were just trying to help me? I shudder to think what they must have thought of me back then... Uhh, sorry, maybe we can leave it there for today? If I go any further than that, I know I'll regret it tomorrow."
Collei,More About Collei: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I was once taken to someone they call ""The Doctor"" for treatment for my Eleazar... well, actually ""treatment"" is the wrong word — it was more... experimentation. After so long in that place, I couldn't help but start to wonder, what have I done wrong to deserve this? Why won't anyone come to rescue me? Gradually, I went from hating just the Fatui to hating everyone in the world. Thinking about it now... it was quite childish."
Collei,"More About Collei: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","Thanks to you guys, my Eleazar has disappeared without a trace. It's the miracle that I never dared to wish for. ...I never held out hope for a cure, I just figured I'd try and just do as much as I could before my body stops moving. First I was focused on revenge, then forest patrol... and now, finally, I am free to live my life."
Collei,"More About Collei: V Friendship Lv. 6 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","Are you going to keep traveling? Let me do my part, please? I'll study hard... whether it's reading, medicine, combat, or assessing the danger... even something small, like checking the streetlights! I hope that many more people will get the help they need along the way... just like how you saved me."
Collei,Collei's Hobbies,"My hobbies? ...Sewing, practicing gliding, and helping people! Hmm? Sounds familiar? Well, that's because... I want to be someone that gives people that warm feeling, too."
Collei,Collei's Troubles,"""In response to the homo— homogenization of crop species... taken import measures... avoid long-term consumption of fungal foods..."" What is the point of all this... They're literally saying, ""I don't wanna eat mushrooms,"" but because they're from the Akademiya, they have to make it sound all complicated!"
Collei,Favorite Food,"Pita pockets are travel-friendly and filling, so they're probably the food I eat the most. But if we're talking about more than just ""filling,"" my favorite food would be... mmm, Fried Radish Balls, I think."
Collei,Least Favorite Food,"During my wandering days, there were times when I had to crack open Wolfhooks and force them down if I didn't want to go hungry, so there aren't really any foods that I especially hate. If I had to pick one thing that I won't touch, it would be mushrooms of any kind. Nothing to do with the flavor — I just don't want to ever be the one on the receiving end of one of Master's stern lectures..."
Collei,Receiving a Gift: I,Mmm... It's delicious! Could you teach me?
Collei,Receiving a Gift: II,"With skills like this, I bet you never go hungry when you're out in the wilderness, huh?"
Collei,Receiving a Gift: III,"Sorry, Master says I'm not supposed to eat anything that looks suspicious."
Collei,Birthday,"Uh, H—Happy Birthday! Here's the cake I made for you, and here are the candles, so yeah... Amber said in her letter that this would do the job... Oh! And, and here's the gift I got for you!...I'm sorry, I don't have much experience arranging birthday parties. I have no idea if you'll like it... Aah, I'm getting all flustered now. If anything's not how you like it, please say, and I'll make absolutely sure to plan a nicer birthday celebration for you next year!"

Collei,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Even if it's a life-or-death situation, I'll never need to rely on their power again."
Collei,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"It probably wouldn't even matter if I unsealed that power now — I've come so far, I think I'd be able to control it, don't you? Well — only one way to find out! Hu-uh!...Just kidding. My real superpower is all about the adventure experience I've had with you."
Cyno,Hello: The Past,"I'm Cyno, the former General Mahamatra. Now I use my abilities to punish evil as I see fit. If you share my devotion to rules and justice, then I can lend you my strength."

Cyno,Chat: Weighing the Heart,"Good deeds and bad... In the end, all will be placed upon the scales."

Cyno,When the Sun Is Out,The sunshine will eventually illuminate every hidden corner.
Cyno,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Careful, the wind is picking up."
Cyno,In the Desert,A familiar sight...
Cyno,Good Morning,Get ready. It's time to go.
Cyno,Good Afternoon,"Want me to prepare lunch today? It's fine with me, but I should warn you, I can't promise it'll be any good."
Cyno,Good Evening,"Remember what I told you? There's always danger lurking in the night, so whatever you do, keep your guard up."
Cyno,Good Night,"Goodnight. Now, there's some criminal activity nearby that I'll go deal with."
Cyno,About Cyno: Unfunny Jokes,"Hmm... a joke? Ah, I've got just the one. Ahem... There once was a traveler, stranded in the desert and dying of thirst, who in desperation prayed for a Hydro Slime to come their way. But the traveler didn't realize that at that very moment, a starving Hydro Slime was praying to meet a lone, stranded traveler... What, not funny? Tsk, I think it's hysterical."
Cyno,About Cyno: Desert Strolls Friendship Lv. 4,"Sometimes I'll take a stroll through the desert at night... The cold, dry air out there helps me clear my mind."
Cyno,About Us: TCG Duel,Up for a game of Genius Invokation TCG? I'll show you the new deck I built.
Cyno,About Us: The Present Friendship Lv. 6,"The past cannot be changed, and the future cannot be foretold. As a result, I make sure to always cherish the here and now."
Cyno,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"You may say that I have received much divine favor, with the spirit that dwells within me, and the god that took heed of my ambition. But I have no intention of letting this affect my code of justice. I will simply continue to do whatever is required to fulfill my duty."
Cyno,Something to Share: Lust for Knowledge,"I think most people understand that an excess of desire will lead to disaster, but people seldom admit that when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge, they're only willing to put it in a positive light. In my opinion, chasing after knowledge is still a form of desire, and must also be reined in."
Cyno,Something to Share: Solemn Respect Friendship Lv. 4,"Any decision I make during a mission can have a profound effect on the fates of others. This is why I must always maintain a solemn respect for my position as a matra, the same way I respect knowledge and power."
Cyno,Interesting Things,"I'm fond of the shrubs that grow in the desert. The desert is a symbol of repose and solitude, and all civilizations will eventually be buried by a sandstorm. But despite these desolate conditions, there are still signs of growth. Sometimes, I really find myself impressed by their tenacity."
Cyno,About Tighnari: Knowledge Friendship Lv. 4,"Tighnari is different from other scholars I've met. He has the same wholehearted dedication to knowledge, but he will never cross the most important boundaries. Some scholars see themselves as gods within their own laboratories, but not Tighnari — he has always shown the same respect for every form of life. I've heard that he even declined a position in the Akademiya, and I support his decision."
Cyno,About Tighnari: Jokes Friendship Lv. 4,"Tighnari once told me not to tell jokes at the dinner table, insisting that my jokes weren't funny at all. I did not share his opinion, so I told three of my best jokes in a row, and explained the premise of each in great detail. By the time I was done talking, my food was cold."
Cyno,About Collei Friendship Lv. 4,"I once helped Collei seal away the god's remains in her body, but the process was an unthinkably painful one. To many, enduring that kind of pain would be a prospect more terrifying than death, so it was very admirable that she was able to persevere through it all."
Cyno,About Alhaitham Friendship Lv. 4 King Deshret and the Three Magi,"I don't really like people who are too smart. They think they can control everything, and constantly venture to the fringes of danger. But Alhaitham is one of the more reliable ones. In most cases, he is actually in control of things and has the ability to avert potential disaster."
Cyno,About Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4,"Tighnari and Collei never said it to my face, but they found Kaveh's personal anecdotes far more entertaining than the jokes I had prepared... I could see it on their faces. Hmm? What did I think about that? Well, I thought it was funny that they could laugh at such a situation."
Cyno,"About Nahida Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","Commenting on a god might be overstepping my position a little... But when I was working with her, I personally witnessed her wisdom, courage, and determination. Compared with those sages who constantly undermined and criticized her without a shred of evidence, I think I can provide a more reliable assessment: She is an exceptional deity who is worthy of everyone's respect."
Cyno,"About Nilou Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",I can sense her enthusiasm and passion for dancing — it has become an integral part of her being. I hope that she will always be able to use the art she loves to bring happiness to other people.
Cyno,About Faruzan Friendship Lv. 4,"I've carefully browsed through the case files regarding Faruzan's disappearance. At the time, I thought maybe she had been conducting some kind of dangerous research, but once I met her in person, I completely abandoned that idea. Though it might be a little hard for me to get along with her, she mostly reminds me of a kindly and chatty parent. She is considerate of others, and would never do anything imprudent."
Cyno,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"Of course I know about Lisa, we once both studied under the same sage. As General Mahamatra, I've seen many tragedies befall those seeking knowledge too assiduously, so it's easy for me to understand her decision."
Cyno,More About Cyno: I,"Huh? You want to know more about me? Hm, I suppose many people see me as a thorn in their side... But don't worry, as long as you don't do anything dangerous, you won't have any trouble with me."
Cyno,More About Cyno: II Friendship Lv. 3,"With my body as a vessel, I can harness the power of the spirit that dwells within me. This is possible in part due to my natural constitution, but also due to a deal I willingly made in the past. There's no reason to shy away from the topic. If I am to weigh the souls of others in this world as a Matra, then I must also place my own soul on the scales to be judged in the same manner."
Cyno,More About Cyno: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Rather than thinking about the ""why"" of things, I prefer to focus on ""what"" has been done. There are countless reasons why people do things in this world, and upon hearing some of those reasons, you can't help but start to feel that the wrongdoer had a point, or that the public is being too harsh on them. The disadvantaged side will always garner people's sympathy, but the judge must abandon all such feelings. We may empathize with the pain and motivations of the accused, but a crime, once committed, cannot be left unpunished."
Cyno,More About Cyno: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"In the gloomy sea of ignorance, a faint glimmer of light will occasionally appear, luring those who do not understand the truth toward it. People will often see that glimmer as a beacon to guide their way, but in doing so overlook the great dangers still lurking in the pitch-black waters. Steering those who have long resided in darkness away from the light is a cruel thing in itself, but I must continue to do so until we can finally defeat the enemies that lay hidden beneath the water's surface."
Cyno,More About Cyno: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I've already told you everything that I think is worth sharing. What else could you possibly want to hear from me? Heh, your curiosity is remarkable... Alright, let's hear your questions. For someone who is used to interrogating others, the feeling of being questioned is... interesting."
Cyno,Cyno's Hobbies,"In my free time, I like to play Genius Invokation TCG with other people. Being able to express so much creativity and variation within a working rule set makes it more than just a game — it's an art form."
Cyno,Cyno's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"Just recently, I saw a light novel from Inazuma based on Genius Invokation TCG. When the main character found themselves in a rough spot, they somehow drew a card that wasn't even supposed to exist. This shook me to the core, and presented me with a great conundrum: Through directly manipulating the deck, they were able to pull off a miracle that nobody could have expected. The question is... should it be seen as breaking the rules, or is this, too, ultimately within the rules of the game?"
Cyno,Favorite Food,"Rice, meat, and dried nuts, mixed with some yogurt and roasted together... what a wonderful mix of flavors. You can feel the aroma seeping out with the steam as you cut into the crispy outside. It doesn't even take very long to make, definitely my favorite dish."
Cyno,Least Favorite Food,"The rations I take with me when traveling through the desert are usually completely tasteless. Once you've eaten enough of those, you'll be grateful for just about anything with some flavor. If I had to pick something, though... I wouldn't say I relish eating bugs or anything bug-related..."
Cyno,Receiving a Gift: I,Tastes great. You have my gratitude.
Cyno,Receiving a Gift: II,I accept. Thank you.
Cyno,Receiving a Gift: III,Agh... This is for me? ...Are you sure?
Cyno,Birthday,"Ahem... I'd like to wish you a happy birthday. Though I don't have much experience with celebrations, once I realized your birthday was coming, I decided to make some preparations. First, I have this deck for you that I worked on for a few days, I think it'll really suit your style. Also, I adjusted my schedule to open up some time, so is there anywhere you'd like to go? I'd be happy to accompany you. A birthday only lasts a day, but you should take the chance to really enjoy it. Just make sure we can be back within three days."
Cyno,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"I can feel new power surging within me, a testament to my growth."
Cyno,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,I vow to uphold the rules and punish evil.
Cyno,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,Nice boost. Thanks a ton.
Cyno,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"My strength has reached its peak, but there are still many things I can never accomplish relying on my fighting power alone. There will still be many times when emotions and rules do not agree, but I think I'll find the key to striking the right balance in the journeys to come."

Diluc,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions are a light in the sea of darkness that surrounds those who have lost their way. But for those who have faith, they are little more than badges of conviction."
Diluc,Something to Share,Occasionally I'll work the bar at Angel's Share. The tavern is known for being the center of information in Mondstadt.
Diluc,Interesting Things,"What? Why do you ask? ...It's an owl, quietly watching its prey from the darkness, waiting for the perfect moment to strike... Flawless."

Diluc,About Mona Friendship Lv. 4,"The land of Mondstadt, by the Anemo Archon's grace, is bountiful. I see no need for the harvest forecasts of astrologers."
Diluc,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,Diona's attitude towards me is... how should I put it? Rather rigid. I've yet to find the opportunity to speak with her properly. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my family line or— Oh? It's not? She simply despises alcohol? Huh... I never thought I'd come across another bartender like myself in Mondstadt.
Diluc,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"Grand Master Varka... Whilst I understand his disposition, I can make no sense of his actions. ... I—I've said too much already. I've long since left the Knights of Favonius. Forget I said anything."
Diluc,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, yes... I've heard about her. She has her own convictions. Her determination to liberate herself from the shackles of her clan is praiseworthy. But, she's... joined the Knights of Favonius."
Diluc,More About Diluc: I,You have business to attend to?
Diluc,More About Diluc: II Friendship Lv. 3,Huh? Knights of Favonius? ...I have nothing to say about them. We have different views is all.

Diluc,More About Diluc: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Checkmate! ...Still, it's been a while since someone tested me this much."
Diluc,More About Diluc: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Not bad. Be it chess or combat, you always seem to surprise me. Hmm... working with you is quite the novelty. So... I look forward to continuing to work with you, partner."
Diluc,Diluc's Hobbies,The artwork in the manor? It's not mine. It's a collection that belonged to my late father.

Diona,About Us: Drinks,"You want a non-alcoholic drink? No, that's not difficult, but it's meaningless! It doesn't have anything to do with my grand plan of destroying the wine industry of Mondstadt. I won't waste my time on such a drink, hmph!"
Diona,About Us: VIP Channels Friendship Lv. 6,"Here! I call this Fantastic Summer-Serendipity Coral Sparkling Tea, I just made it one day when I was bored... Huh, you say it's popular? People are lining up to buy it? Don't be ridiculous."

Hmph! ...*sigh* Since you won't stop asking... and since we are friends, I'll tell you: One time, my daddy went missing on a hunt in a big storm. All I could think of was finding him, saving him... That's it, are you happy now!"

Diona,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Every time Klee wants to play with me, I take her somewhere far from the tavern. Alcohol and explosives... yeah, that's a dangerous combination! I mean, do I want to destroy the wine industry of Mondstadt? Yes, but not in that sense!"

Diona,More About Diona: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Don't, don't make me angry. I'm pretty tolerant, but don't even try to mess with me. I'm warning you, I bite when I get angry! Meow!!! ...But maybe I'd let you off easy, no bites..."
Diona,More About Diona: V Friendship Lv. 6,"You and me... we're good friends now, right? I kind of remember having a friend like this before, but maybe it was a dream... Here, give me your hand. Ahh... Hmm, nice and warm... Very nice... please don't leave me, and become another dream."
Diona,Diona's Hobbies,"I enjoy hunting. I'm especially good at tracking down prey! But Daddy says that the wild is dangerous. One should only go deep into the forest with a reliable adult. ...You're a reliable adult, right?"
Diona,Diona's Troubles,"How, oh how can I make awful-tasting drinks...? I had high hopes for the soy sauce, milk, Jueyun Chili, and Dandelion Seed cocktail — my most nightmarish combination to date! But even that was met with praise at the tavern. ""This is Little Diona's best drink yet..."" Grr! But I won't give up..."
Diona,Favorite Food,"I like, no, LOVE to eat fish! The fish Daddy cooks is the best, a purrfect main course! ...But eating fish as drunk food, that's absolute blasphemy!"
Diona,Least Favorite Food,"Carrots, potatoes, onions, tomatoes... I don't like the taste of any of those vegetables. ...In fact, I don't eat vegetables at all!"
Diona,Receiving a Gift: I,Mmm! I just wanna ask you this... Will you bring more of it next time?
Diona,Receiving a Gift: II,"I'll admit, that was pretty sweet... but that doesn't mean I haven't had sweeter."
Diona,Receiving a Gift: III,"Hey... What do you take me for, some sort of stray cat!?"
Diona,Birthday,"Here you go — fried fish with my special sauce! ...Relax, I didn't add anything strange! My cooking is actually really good when I want it to be — stop talking and try it already! Hmph... that's better... Oh, and uh, happy birthday."

Dori,Chat: Mora,"♪ I love Mora, and Mora loves me! I make Mora, and it makes me happy! Lalala... ♪"
Dori,Chat: Win-Win,"First, I mark up the price by 30% and then I offer a 20% discount. More Mora for me, and the customers still feel like they're getting a bargain. Now that's what I call a win-win."
Dori,Chat: Money-Mad,"With enough Mora, you can afford to do anything — even take on the Akademiya."
Dori,When It Rains,"Need to stay dry? I have just the thing! This specialty umbrella collects and purifies rain water, turning it into drinking water that is conveniently stored in this compact container — a real must-have for a traveler like yourself! And all that for only 500,000 Mora!"
Dori,When Thunder Strikes,I bet even the caravans can't move under these conditions. I'm losing Mora here...
Dori,When It Snows,Oh oh oh! Check out my fully-automatic snowball maker! It's one of a kind! Wanna give it a try? I'll even throw in a 5% discount on the rental!
Dori,When the Sun Is Out,"There's nothing more beautiful than shiny Mora, glittering in the sun! Hehe."
Dori,When the Wind Is Blowing,"You've gotta be kidding! Who would be crossing the desert on such a windy day? Silly toadstools... What's that? Oh, I can get them out of there of course... But I'll have to triple my usual price, hehehe."
Dori,Good Morning,"Good morning! Last night I had a dream filled with lovely, round, shiny Mora. Seems like today I'm gonna make a fortune!"
Dori,Good Afternoon,"You wanna take a nap? I can offer you a soft, fluffy cushion that will perfectly conform to the contour of your back. Of course, the level of comfort also depends on how much Mora you're willing to pay."
Dori,Good Evening,"Traveling at night can be a real challenge, but for a seasoned merchant like me, it's a walk in the park!"
Dori,Good Night,"Trying to sleep? Hehe, alright. I'll be generous and let you try my Mora Hypnosis! Don't say I never gave you anything! It goes like this: 10,000 Mora in my coin purse, 20,000 Mora in my coin purse, 30,000 Mora in my coin purse, 40... 40,000 Mora hehe... Mora hehe... Zzz..."
Dori,About Dori: Peddling,"Welcome to Dori's Divine Bazaar! Everything you need with service you can rely on! You name it, we've got it! Questions or troubles? I'm here to personally assist you!"
Dori,About Dori: Kshahrewar Friendship Lv. 4,"I tend to avoid people from the Akademiya, all those rules and regulations of theirs make it nearly impossible to do good business. Although, those from the Kshahrewar tend to be a little more sensible... Ahem, between the two of us, they signed a private contract with me. I have the Mora, they have the technology and crafting techniques. This collaboration will practically roll in opportunities for my business. Hehe, a Dori deal is always a lucrative deal!"
Dori,About Us: Promotion,"Planning to travel in Sumeru? The desert can be pretty dangerous, you know — but don't worry, Dori's always got your back! Ta-daaa! This is the Desert Survival Kit. Available to you for only 5 million Mora! Buy it now and I'll throw in an additional Rainforest Survival Kit, free of charge! This deal is available for a limited time only, so don't miss your chance!"
Dori,About Us: Mora Distribution,"My Mora is mine, and your Mora is mine too! Hehehe."
Dori,About Us: Actual Price Friendship Lv. 6,"Fine fine, I'll be honest with you... The desert and rainforest survival kits are worth two and a half million Mora each. But buy one get one free sure sounds like a good bargain, doesn't it?"
Dori,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Wow, just look at it... My Vision is so shiny and beautiful, isn't it? Don't you think you should pay me a fee for the privilege of seeing such an exquisite beauty?"
Dori,Something to Share,"Once, some stupid toadstools thought they could get away with not paying what they owed. Hmph, little did they know who they were messing with! ...Can you guess what happened to them?"
Dori,Interesting Things: Common Language,"If Weasel Thieves could talk, I bet we'd have a lot in common. What they love most in all of Teyvat is, of course, shiny Mora! Sounds like they've got good heads on their shoulders if you ask me."
Dori,Interesting Things: Sumpter Beast Park,"You'd like to see a Sumpter Beast? No problem! I've got more than you could ever dream of! I'd be happy to let you see them, for a fee... hehe."
Dori,About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4,"You could say I know him. After all, I was the only merchant in all Sumeru who could acquire the full range of Genius Invokation TCG merch for him! Not bad, huh? I've gotta admit, it's pretty rare to see anyone from the Akademiya like him... independent and with a good head on his shoulders. Plus, he's never been one to haggle over prices."
Dori,About Tighnari Friendship Lv. 4,"He loves learning as much as I love Mora. I heard he makes a lot of little interesting gadgets, but he refuses to partner with me to mass produce them. He always says he's too busy with work, but really it's just an excuse. sigh A shame, really... We could make an absolute fortune!"
Dori,About Alhaitham Friendship Lv. 4,"He once came nosing around, asking my minions some questions to see what he could find out. Like I said, those Akademiya people are just pig-headed and dishonest. Why should I take the risk of others prying into my business? Right, my young apprentice?"
Dori,About Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yeah, he's one of the Kshahrewar people that I work with. Unlike the more closed-minded people at the Akademiya, he actually has his own dreams that he's fighting for. I, for one, really respect that. I secretly lent him some Mora — and I mean a LOT of Mora — to build my Palace of Alcazarzaray. One thing's for sure — without Dori the benevolent benefactor, Kaveh would not be where he is today, hehe."
Dori,About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4,"I hire her to help escort my caravans from time to time. After all, she's got the muscle, and her price is reasonable. When it comes to cost-performance ratio, she's always the best pick."
Dori,About Rex Lapis Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Before Rex Lapis parted from this world, I'd say a little prayer every morning: ""O great God of Wealth up above, please bless my day with more Mora to love."" But uh, now, I guess I just pray to myself... ""O divine Dori right here and now, please bless my day with more Mora to count!"" Hehe."
Dori,About Lesser Lord Kusanali Friendship Lv. 4,"In Sumeru, Lesser Lord Kusanali has very few believers. Hmm? Am I one? Heh, if she's willing to pay me, I'd be her loyal believer for all eternity."
Dori,About Nilou Friendship Lv. 4,"She's a good dancer, but definitely not making the most of her time by staying in Sumeru... I mean, it's a complete waste of her talent. If I took her on tour across all Teyvat, do you have any idea how much Mora I'd rake in?"
Dori,About Alice Friendship Lv. 4,"Alice's range of eccentric novelties knows no end! Which makes her by far my best supplier, hehe. Ahem, now that I've told you my trade secret, I think you should catch up on your tuition fees, hmm? C'mon, pay up!"
Dori,More About Dori: I,"You wanna hear some stories? Alright, it'll cost you a million Mora. Well... Okay, out of respect for our friendship, I guess I can give you a 1% discount. So that'll be 990,000 Mora. Pretty good deal if you ask me."
Dori,More About Dori: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Hehe, you've got a good head on your shoulders. I'll tell you a story about a merchant.A long, long time ago, a merchant lost her way while she was out on the road. It wasn't long before she encountered a Fog Div. Just as the Fog Div was about to eat her alive, she said in a panic, ""Wait, Mr. Fog Div! Don't eat me! I've got a story to tell you. Please, have a listen, and if you like what you hear, then perhaps you would spare me..."
Dori,More About Dori: III Friendship Lv. 4,"...The Fog Div agreed to listen, and the merchant began to tell her story. It was about herself, from a time when business was not doing so well. Just as she was beginning to feel helpless, she happened to find a magic lamp in her warehouse. She began to polish the lamp, when all of a sudden, a puff of red smoke came out. The smoke spoke to her and claimed to be The Genie of Beauty and Kindness. The merchant somehow reminded the genie of her own lovely daughter, so she kindly offered to grant the merchant a wish."
Dori,More About Dori: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"What could a merchant ever desire more than the prospect of more Mora? So the merchant wished that she could earn more Mora in the future than she could ever hope to count. The Genie of Beauty and Kindness agreed, and became the merchant's supplier, providing her with magical and fantastic goods. The merchant soon went on to make a fortune..."
Dori,More About Dori: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Hearing the merchant's story, the Fog Div became very puzzled. The div and the genie were obviously of the same species, so how come the div couldn't perform any magic? The merchant praised the Fog Div's potential, saying that it, too, would surely gain the genie's great power if only it were to stay in the same magic lamp. The Fog Div agreed and entered the merchant's magic lamp... Huh? Is this a real story? Backstory details cost extra! Give me another 990,000 Mora and I'll tell you!"
Dori,Dori's Hobbies,"Hobbies? Sure, I've got tons of hobbies. First there's earning Mora, then there's counting Mora... Oh, and then I like to look at Mora. Ah Mora, nothing in the world makes me happier!"
Dori,Dori's Troubles,"I always have people coming to me with business proposals that could yield only 30% profit. I'm a busy lady, you know. Please, anything under 100% profit, I don't even want to hear about it."
Dori,Favorite Food,"I hear there's a dish in Liyue called Mora Meat. With a name like that, I know it's gotta be delicious! Wh—What? You know how to make it!? Well ahem, you have been my apprentice for some time now, and you must've learned a lot from me. So uh, in exchange for all that you've learned, why don't you cook some Mora Meat for me? Well, what are you waiting for!?"
Dori,Least Favorite Food,"I can't stand anything that's dark and burnt looking... you know, like Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes. Ugh, I will never even touch them! Even if you paid me a million Mora, I... Uh, well if that were the case, maybe I'd consider it."
Dori,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm, yummy! What do you say we partner up, hmm? You could also be my personal chef!"
Dori,Receiving a Gift: II,"Oh, so my apprentice knows their way around the kitchen, huh? Alright, lemme order something..."
Dori,Receiving a Gift: III,"You expect me to eat this? Hmph, you'd better compensate me for the mental trauma!"
Dori,Birthday,"Today I can grant you one wish! After all, I am the great and almighty Dori! Go on, tell me, what do you wish for? But lemme just tell you now that a lifetime supply of Mora is off the table."
Dori,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Does this mean you're investing in me? Hehe, I always knew you had a good head on your shoulders."
Dori,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"The Mora, the merrier."
Dori,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,Wow! This is like having a bottomless coin pouch filled with endless power!
Dori,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Congratulations! You are now a VIP customer of the illustrious Lord Sangemah Bay! This entitles you to enjoy a 20% discount on all future purchases. You're also the first VIP customer ever, so make good use of it!"
Eula,Hello,"Captain Eula Lawrence, Spindrift Knight, Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company. I extend to you my greetings. Huh? What's that...? Yes, Lawrence, the evil aristocrats of historical infamy. Oh, we're still very much evil. Just look at me, I'm infiltrating the inner ranks of the Knights of Favonius, all as part of a diabolical plan to exact our revenge and reclaim our former glory!"
Eula,Chat: Etiquette,"Knights and aristocrats share the same cultural heritage, but the knights had enough sense to do away with all the superfluous detail."
Eula,Chat: Bladework,"You want to learn some Favonius Bladework? Heh, alright then, I'll teach you.... Oh yes, I'll teach you, alright, mark my words..."
Eula,Chat: Rules,"Aristocratic etiquette is all just for show... Just smile and nod along! I was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even I don't take them that seriously."
Eula,When It Rains,"Quick, under the umbrella, or you'll get soaked! You can't risk catching a cold, because it might turn into something more serious, and if that happens... Well, I can't go avenging my clan by picking on the sick now, can I?"
Eula,When Thunder Strikes,"This weather is a hindrance. The thunder drowns out all other sounds, hampering my perception of the surrounding environment."
Eula,When the Sun Is Out,"Visibility is excellent! If we head to higher ground, we can do a full recon of enemy activity in the area."
Eula,Good Morning,"Rise and shine! The two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift."
Eula,Good Afternoon,"Go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. If you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move."
Eula,Good Evening,"""May the gentle breeze softly send thee into a sweet sleep."" ...One of a select few aristocratic pleasantries that's actually quite lovely."
Eula,Good Night,"Would you like to hear a lullaby on the bone whistle? It'll send you into a deep and everlasting sleep... Hmm, no. When it comes to my revenge, far more imaginative means of retribution are in order..."
Eula,About Eula: The Knights,"The easiest way to destroy your enemy is to take them down from the inside, right? That's why I joined the Knights of Favonius."
Eula,About Eula: Bearing,"Since I'm a genuine Knight of Favonius, I fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. Look, I may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but I'm not a total degenerate!"
Eula,About Eula: Scout,"The role of a scout is to hunt down enemy troops, or fend off the enemy in side skirmishes away from the main battle. There aren't a whole lot of rules, which suits my style very well indeed!"
Eula,About Eula: Dance Friendship Lv. 4,"Not all customs of the Lawrence Clan are despicable. At least the ""Dance of Sacrifice"" is pure and noble. It puts my mind at ease and gives me comfort. It's been years, but it's still dear to me. My body remembers every step that I... Well anyway, to end this digression, those who wish to master my signature ""Favonius Bladework"" technique have to pass my dance class first."
Eula,About Us: Commonality,"We're not so different, you and I. We're both outsiders in Mondstadt. Difference is, Mondstadt welcomes you with open arms, but they treat me with hostility and suspicion..."
Eula,About Us: Feud Friendship Lv. 6,"Our feud is for the long term, so rather than get payback on a piecemeal basis, I think I'll make things easier for myself and wait for a day when I can settle the score once and for all. It could be in ten years, could even be twenty... But don't worry, I won't forget. In the meantime, I'll need you to take good care of yourself and have a happy, healthy life, okay?"
Eula,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"""Descendant of a depraved dynasty"" isn't the most flattering reputation to have. The only way I can shake it for good is if I keep avenging my kin in my own way. Those who desire vengeance need power first, so it makes sense that I would get a Vision."
Eula,Something to Share: Bone Whistle Friendship Lv. 4,"My bone whistle makes a versatile range of sounds, which comes in handy for confusing the enemy. I often use it to imitate the sound of the sea, which is where I get my title of ""Spindrift Knight"" — this despite the fact that the bone whistle is actually a Liyue tradition.... But then again, no one seems to look too closely into that kind of thing. I'm mean, they took me on, and I'm an exile of Mondstadt trained by an outcast of Liyue..."
Eula,Something to Share: Wine-Tasting Friendship Lv. 4,"Technically, aged Dandelion Wine should be poured into a silver goblet and allowed to breathe for 12 minutes, then you're supposed to add ice cubes, ideally so 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine. I refuse to do all that though, it's not worth the hassle."
Eula,Interesting Things,"Why do Mist Flowers have to be so rare? The powder they produce works wonders for the bone whistle. It gives it a crisper, clearer sound."
Eula,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!"
Eula,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"The Acting Grand Master's family and mine are sworn enemies. But she draws a clear line between professional and personal matters. She saw I was capable, admitted me into the Knights, and gave me lots of opportunities. So, when the time comes for vengeance, I'll afford her a reasonably soft landing."
Eula,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"She's so annoying. She must have read thousands of books... could even be tens of thousands. Meaning, she can effortlessly recall any number of vile tales about the Lawrence Clan's corruption off the top of her head, accurate down to the exact date. Logically speaking, she'd be the perfect person to talk to about someone I'd like to track down, but... swallowing my pride would be too great a challenge."
Eula,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not. I can't imagine a ""Shining Idol"" would want anything to do with a descendant of a depraved dynasty."
Eula,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmph, the Grand Master... He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity! I will not let it go!"
Eula,About Venti Friendship Lv. 4,"I heard that bard sing a few songs about the Lawrence Clan... They were lighthearted and funny stories that mocked the clan in a way I've never heard anyone else do. Even I couldn't help but burst out laughing... And for this, he must pay!"
Eula,About Razor Friendship Lv. 4,"Free from social mores and other people's opinions, and no family obligations... Must be an easy life!"
Eula,About Sucrose Friendship Lv. 4,"The alchemist... She once gave me a piece of equipment and told me it would help me infiltrate an Abyss Order camp undetected. In reality, it caused a huge explosion that completely blew my cover and before I knew it I was being accosted by 13 mitachurls... Afterwards, I marched straight back there, intending to make her pay for what she had done, but when I saw how panicked and sheepish she looked, and watched her post her results on the wall with the word ""Fail,"" I couldn't bring myself to go through with it... After all, I didn't get hurt, just a little disheveled... and a little humiliated."
Eula,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't get along with some of the knights, and he doesn't think much of them in general, so you'd think that would make us allies. But the way he always acts so aloof — he's even worse than Acting Grand Master Jean. I want nothing to do with him."
Eula,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,"Diona? She's a miracle worker when it comes to making cocktails, and to my surprise, we get along really well. She infiltrated a tavern with the hopes of tearing down the wine industry, while I infiltrated the knights to exact my revenge on them. A kindred spirit it seems..."
Eula,About Yanfei: Encounter Friendship Lv. 4,"This one's a long story... We ended up saving her life once when we were tracking down a batch of dangerous cargo that belonged to the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo — and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate."
Eula,About Yanfei: Assessment Friendship Lv. 4,"We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book... Also, with her smarts, maybe she could help me track someone down that I've been looking for... She does owe me a favor from last time, after all."
Eula,About Mika: Communication Friendship Lv. 4,"When Mika was assigned to the Reconnaissance Company, I thought that he'd only last a few days, just like the others before him. But he surprised me. He never made a peep, but he completed all of his tasks quite admirably. He even volunteered to run errands for me, and assist with communication... Hmph... I don't know who is going around telling people that I need looking after..."
Eula,More About Eula: I,"The life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner."
Eula,More About Eula: II Friendship Lv. 3,"People tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!"
Eula,More About Eula: III Friendship Lv. 4,"The Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?"
Eula,More About Eula: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"The name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal."
Eula,More About Eula: V Friendship Lv. 6,"If my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!"
Eula,Eula's Hobbies,"I'm into all sorts of cool things. Sipping a nice cold drink, sitting in a canyon feeling the biting wind howl past my face, or diving into the lake at the foot of Dragonspine... Waiting for you to stroll by unsuspectingly, so I can sneak up behind you and drag you down into the icy depths..."
Eula,Eula's Troubles,"Sometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers. But once they find out that I'm a Lawrence, suddenly everyone gets indignant and provocative, and starts trying to bait me out in some way. I just want to have a drink, is that too much to ask!?"
Eula,Favorite Food,"I like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces."
Eula,Least Favorite Food,"I can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!"
Eula,Receiving a Gift: I,Oh? Are you putting me to the test? Challenge accepted.
Eula,Receiving a Gift: II,"Eh, not that great... How about you try it?"
Eula,Receiving a Gift: III,"The nerve on you, are you exacting revenge?"
Eula,Birthday,"Today is a day worth observing, though you shouldn't mark your development in age alone. Accept my gift of a bone whistle, and allow me to teach you its secrets. When your day of reckoning comes, see how long you can fend me off with it... It'll make the whole thing much more exciting."
Eula,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"My fighting skills just got a whole lot stronger... But I shouldn't get too conceited just yet. There are some truly formidable knights among our ranks, and I must outperform them immeasurably if I wish to defeat them and avenge my clan!"
Eula,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Good! With this much power, I daresay even the Acting Grand Master herself would be no match for me!"
Eula,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"How strange... In the time I've spent with you, my strength seems to have improved exceptionally quickly. I suppose I was rather fortunate to make an enemy of you. I'd better dig my teeth in to make sure you can't get away!"
Eula,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Excellent! The unstoppable power of an immovable glacier dwells within me now and no grand master, acting or otherwise, can stand in my way! There is no time to delay. I must devise my plan, and unleash my attack! Once I have crushed the Knights of Favonius beneath my heel, my next target... is you. Don't try to run. Stand beside me and witness all that must come to pass."
Fischl,Hello,"Fischl: I, Fischl, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, descend upon this land by the call of fate an— Oh, you are also a traveler from another world? Very well, I grant you permission to travel with me.Oz: She means, ""Nice to meet you."

Fischl,When Thunder Strikes,"Fischl: Hark! 'Tis Thundering Retribution, an omen of dark times ahead...Oz: That, and mein Fräulein's laundry is still on the line...Fischl: Wha... Seriously!?"
Fischl,When It Snows,"Fischl: A wonderful sight indeed. Why, it reminds me of my home world, where at the sight of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, the very blood and tears of sinners turn to ice! ...Achoo!

That is but one of my many royal engagements."
Fischl,About Us: Beings Who Descended Upon This World,"Huh, you and I are both travelers from another world. That our paths have crossed here is no accident, but the will of fate."
Fischl,About Us: Shooting Down the World Beast Friendship Lv. 6,"You seem... troubled. Traveler, do not lose heart! For with my left eye, the Auge der Verurteilung, which sees the threads of fate, I will surely keep you from harm. And Oz, the raven that has witnessed the demise of countless worlds, will watch over you on your journey. Should this world, like a beast prowling in the night, covet your dreams, then I, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, shall fell it with my ensorcelled arrows of judgment!"
Fischl,About Us: Ones Dear to Heart Friendship Lv. 6,"Fischl: Oz, my loyal companion. That we should have met this person, one who hails from another world as I do... Perhaps even cruel fate has deigned to smile upon me, though sin courses through my veins. If I am indeed destined to remain here, in this inescapable prison that is reality, at least—Oz: I understand mein Fräulein! In this traveler, Fräulein has found one who will never forsake her."
Fischl,About Us: Standing Watch Friendship Lv. 6,"Fischl: Ozvaldo von Hrafnavins.

Fischl,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh? You inquire about my Edelstein der Dunkelheit? It is a royal heirloom, a ceremonial ornament that displays the majesty of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung before the unworthy. Even here, in this fallen world, I have been reunited with my rightful inheritance as one of royal blood and noble spirit, for the majesty of a true princess shall draw her royal heirlooms unto her wherever so she may roam."
Fischl,Something to Share,"Fischl: If one must reckon time as this world does, I, Fischl, have already seen three thousand winters. Not that the illusory passage of time has any bearing on one such as I, to whom the causality of three thousand universes has been unveiled.Oz: Be that as it may, mein Fräulein, you are not yet considered to be of drinking age in this world, and no bartender can ever be convinced otherwise."
Fischl,Interesting Things,"Oz's full name is Ozvaldo von Hrafnavins. Where I hail from, he holds dominion over star and sky across three universes, and the souls of the mighty, fallen in battle, rest in the shadow of his wings. One should add that the penalty for mispronouncing his name is to have one's tongue torn from one's mouth. However, as I am a princess and you are one who has my favor, we are at liberty to simply call him, ""Oz."
Fischl,About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl: Ah, the ill-starred young man... My Auge der Verurteilung has seen with unmistakable clarity how his heart ails at being forsaken by the world—Oz: Someone needs to keep an eye on the unlucky fellow."

Win her trust, and one may yet gain access to a vast repository of wisdom...Oz: She means as long as you return your first few library books on time, you'll never have any trouble borrowing a book again."
Fischl,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl: His nature is obscure, his fate a mystery, and his speech a vexing tapestry woven of both fact and fiction... Perhaps he and I share the burden of mystical sight...Oz: Or perhaps he's secretly an actual pirate?"
Fischl,About Mona Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl: Aha, yes, Mona, the mighty astrologer... Mona, who once had the vanity to probe the fate of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung herself! She wound up a trembling wreck, overborne and overmastered.Oz: *whispering* The poor lass was trying desperately not to laugh. It was no easy task."
Fischl,About Rosaria Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl: One finds Sister Rosaria to be a most devout believer in the Anemo Archon.Oz: ...""Devout believer,"" mein Fräulein?Fischl: Indeed! One night, I heard her invoking the name of the Archon thus in another's presence: ""May you be struck down in the name of Lord Bartabos!"" One presumed that she was leading a prayer."
Fischl,More About Fischl: I,"To condemn the guilty, to sanctify the just, and to draw all castaway dreams into the embrace of the infinite Immernachtreich. This is the birthright of the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and her burden. None may gainsay it."
Fischl,More About Fischl: II Friendship Lv. 3,"My left eye? It is the all-seeing Auge der Verurteilung, which reveals all that is true in the world. As to the question of why I conceal it... Well, would you willingly bear the agony of piercing to the heart of all truths? Furthermore... the world would lose much of its appeal if wholly stripped of delusion and falsehood."
Fischl,More About Fischl: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl: Stormterror? Why, one never would have thought that a being that one might have kept as her pet could, in this world, be capable of causing such calamity. *sigh* Pitiable are the incompetents of this world...Oz: That said, mein Fräulein, were you not beside yourself with worry for everyone's safety during said calamity?Fischl: Th—That is because the Prinzessin der Verurteilung has the solemn duty to safeguard the souls of all, be they petty beings or not..."
Fischl,More About Fischl: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Oz: Some people address her by other names. But to me, the one who gave me life and bestowed my powers upon me is Fischl, and none other. All things considered, Fischl is the name that most aptly captures her identity. Seriously, don't call her anything else, or—Fischl: Oh, how one's royal ears do burn! Pray tell, what is the matter which you discuss so furtively?Oz: Mid—Midnight Phantasmagoria, mein Fräulein! And... the majesty of Verurteilung name!"
Fischl,More About Fischl: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Why must the Prinzessin der Verurteilung punish sin? Because sin defies fate's rightful decree, of course! ...And of course, fate brought you here, so, so... Ahem! It was fate that saw to your descent upon this world, destiny that saw our paths intertwined. I, Fischl, shall always protect you. Because... because fate has revealed to me that this is what has been decreed!"

Fischl,Fischl's Troubles,"What does it take to rile a princess? ...If you must know, it is those who cannot recognize my true identity. But it is no great loss, for solitude is the noble's lot, so long as I do not lose the nobility of my soul..."
Fischl,Favorite Food,"Fischl: Hmph! What is food but the shackles of mortal flesh? ...But if the Prinzessin der Verurteilung should reckon any morsel worthy, then it must be the tears of sinners and the tongues of liars.Oz: Has mein Fräulein lost her appetite for the Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens?Fischl: ...Uh— That is merely to provide mine earthly vessel with such sustenance as it doth require to perform its royal duties!"
Fischl,Least Favorite Food,"Oz: I believe I know the answer to this one...Fischl: Indeed you do, Oz! Ah, that the poor mortal coil, mutilated by bondage unnatural...Oz: It will never again fly as I do...Fischl: Deprived of the humble coif with which it was born to gaze in awe at the majesty of its monarch... Surely it is a glimpse of my homeworld's hell, in the flesh. Hmm, the name of the dish escapes me...Oz: Something something ""Madame,"" isn't it?"
Fischl,Receiving a Gift: I,Fischl: Such an exquisite delicacy is worthy of being served in the Garten Sanssouci.Oz: Mein Fräulein says that she thoroughly enjoys your delicious cooking.
Fischl,Receiving a Gift: II,"Fischl: To vanquish the Beast of the World, one must first rise above mundane desires, thus weaving the path that leads to destiny.Oz: And yet, on this occasion, you appear to have eaten your fill, mein Fräulein."
Fischl,Receiving a Gift: III,Fischl: Why dost thou insist on raining down chaos and destruction in the presence of your Prinzessin?Oz: Mein Fräulein does not care a great deal for this dish. My apologies.
Fischl,Birthday,"Fischl: Well! If today is truly the anniversary of your birth, it shan't do for me not to mark the occasion. You have my full attention. Speak! Speak to me of your wishes, that which you most desire to fulfill during your fleeting and harsh existence in this wretched world. Whatever that wish may be. Even if, perchance—Oz: She means, ""Happy Birthday, and if you want, she can—""Fischl: Silence, Oz."
Fischl,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Fischl: My magic arrow cries out my holy name as it streaks through the night, praying that the violet lightning of retribution shall strike the enemies of fate down from the skies!Oz: Quite awe-inspiring, mein Fräulein! Since it's nearly dinner time, perhaps you might shoot a pigeon down while you're at it?"
Fischl,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Fischl: With this, I may more fully manifest my majesty as Prinzessin der Verurteilung, and defeat that sworn enemy of fate named ""reality.""Oz: It will also be of use in your work for the Adventurers' Guild, mein Fräulein."
Fischl,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Rejoice! Else, tremble in fear! Whenceforth springs this call to mirth and misery, you ask? Let it be known that I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, sovereign of the Immernachtreich, have peered forth with mine leftmost eye into the tapestry of fate that doth make up the universe, and beheld its every warp, weft and dangling orphaned thread!"
Fischl,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I appear to have now regained most of the strength I lost in my transition to this world. Mwuhahaha, the day of judgment is nigh! ...Ah, worry not. Even at the last, when I bring the lightning of retribution upon this world, you shall come to no harm, for thou art blessed by the Prinzessin."
Ganyu,Hello,"Copy that! Here is a draft Service Agreement for your review and consideration. Effective immediately, if all is in order... Ah! Wait a sec, wait a sec, I forgot to sign it... Gan... Yu... There. Right. Now... What was it you needed me to do for you exactly?"
Ganyu,Chat: Relaxed,It's so nice to de-stress.
Ganyu,Chat: Attentive,"If you lie on the grass, you can feel the heartbeat of the world."
Ganyu,Chat: Anxious,Should we really be off work this early? There is still a lot left to do...
Ganyu,When It Rains: Worries,"Oh good! I was just thinking that the Silk Flowers at the Feiyun Commerce Guild needed watering. The transport co-ordinators will probably moan about the muddy mountain roads again, though..."
Ganyu,When It Rains: Listening to the Rain,"It is something of a luxury, but I love listening to the rain from the courtyard."
Ganyu,After the Rain,"Oh, the sun's out. When did that happen?"
Ganyu,When the Sun Is Out,"Ah, the air is just right."
Ganyu,When It's Windy,"Ah, I love the smell of Glaze Lilies."
Ganyu,Good Morning,"Morning! What's wrong, is there something stuck in my hair? ...Oh. Please don't stare at my h—hairpiece."
Ganyu,Good Afternoon,"Ugh... I need a nap. If there aren't any urgent matters, I'll excuse myself..."
Ganyu,Good Evening,"Look how brightly lit the city is at night! Amazing. I wonder what it's like for all the people down there... Hmm? Umm... No thanks, I think I'll pass on the night market. Sorry..."
Ganyu,Good Night,May Rex Lapis watch over you. May your dreams be peaceful and sweet.
Ganyu,About Ganyu,My job is to honor my contract with Rex Lapis by looking out for the interests of all living things in Liyue.
Ganyu,About Us: Work,I finished all my assignments early today. ...O—Overtime? I understand. I'll get right on the case.
Ganyu,About Us: Requests Friendship Lv. 6,"I want to understand more about humans... And I especially wish to hear what you think of them. Why, you ask? Because you're... you're a bit different from most people in Teyvat, just as I am... please, tell me what you think."
Ganyu,About Us: Evaluation Friendship Lv. 6,"Um so, yeah, uh, I was, uh... I was wondering what your opinion is on my work so far? Would you say I'm... more of a Common Chest or more of a Luxurious Chest? I—It's fine. I—I can, uh... I can take it."
Ganyu,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"""With authority over a thousand comes responsibility to a thousand."" Rex Lapis knows the meaning of hardship better than anyone else in Liyue — he has seen everything that has happened from ancient times to the present day, and yet he was forced to give up his entire life. Compared to him, I'm just an everyday Vision holder with everyday responsibilities. I can't complain about my workload."
Ganyu,Something to Share,"""Where merchants flock and all ships dock, and over the oceans flows its stock."" People say this in praise of Liyue's prosperity. But a city only becomes this successful through everyone playing their part diligently. That's the attitude I take to my work — I want to be worthy of what we enjoy here."
Ganyu,Interesting Facts: Name,"I've named every single doggie living in Liyue. But they're so funny, some of them still respond even when you call them the completely wrong name. How fascinating is that? Like, if people were to call me ""Bantu,"" how am I supposed to know they're talking to me? No way would I respond."
Ganyu,Interesting Facts: Qingxin,"Qingxin Flower petals are pretty tasty. Incredibly tasty, actually. The only reason I don't plant any at Yujing Terrace is because they taste so good that I worry I wouldn't be able to control myself... Huh? Bitter... Yes, they are... Isn't that what they're supposed to taste like?"
Ganyu,About Morax: Trust Friendship Lv. 4,"I have absolute faith in Rex Lapis. It was only through his leadership that we were able to repel the monsters and subdue the sea creatures, and thus protect the peace of Liyue. The sight of him protecting the masses, and the memory of our centuries of camaraderie... I shall never forget it."
Ganyu,About Morax: Follower Friendship Lv. 4,"All of Rex Lapis' decisions prioritize the welfare of all life in Liyue. That's what I admire about him the most. I want to live up to the same standard... but it seems that the harder I try to follow in his footsteps, the more overwhelmed I get and the more mistakes I make..."
Ganyu,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue. The current one, Ningguang, does it with unmatched efficiency, but that efficacious manner of hers draws a great deal of criticism. I suppose it is always simpler to criticize than to tolerate."
Ganyu,About Keqing: Estrangement Friendship Lv. 4,"I cannot stand her disrespectful attitude towards Rex Lapis! But he says to me, ""Ganyu, this is just the kind of person Liyue needs in this day and age."" I guess I'm not smart enough, because I simply do not understand what he means by that. I think I need more life experience to become wise enough to comprehend his words."
Ganyu,About Keqing: Changing Perspective Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"She came to me recently to discuss the reopening of the Bishui trade route. She even asked me what Rex Lapis would do if it were him. Admittedly, what we came up with was not quite on par with what he would have chosen. But... seeing the way she kept starting her plan from scratch over and over again, I think I started to understand her a little bit."
Ganyu,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"You mean the boy in the blue jacket from the Feiyun Commerce Guild? He's nothing like his father and brother, doesn't seem to care about the textile business at all. Seems it's because as far as he's concerned, there are more important things for him to be doing. Of course, I'm merely speculating..."
Ganyu,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"Xiangling is a celebrity! Um, but... I try to avoid her restaurant. Just... because. No reason. ...Okay, fine. It's not a big secret anyway. It's because you can smell her cooking all the way from the other end of the street. And once you get a whiff, I mean, that's it. You're gone. Next thing you know, you're ordering your second, maybe third round... You just can't control it. Even though I only eat the vegetarian dishes, I don't know what it is. But that is not a road I want to go down again... Not after..."
Ganyu,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Recently, everyone in Yujing Terrace has been saying nasty things about the Crux Fleet. But in my personal opinion, Beidou's contribution to Liyue Harbor goes far beyond what those miserable rumor-loving heathens could even contemplate! ...Oops! I'm sorry, I... I'm not quite sure how that one slipped out..."
Ganyu,About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4,"Yaoyao... Someone I know at the Ministry of Civil Affairs tasked me with keeping an eye on her in the city, making sure she doesn't try and sneak aboard the Crux... Oh, you want to know what the Ministry of Civil Affairs does? ...Who knows, am I right!? Heh... Who knows what they do? ...Not me..."
Ganyu,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4,"He seems like a bit of an outsider, socially. Probably just his personality... I can understand that, to be honest, but I'm not really about to try and get close to him. I mean... all the people he's ever agreed to team up with are no longer with us..."
Ganyu,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, Yanfei... Even back when she was an innocent little girl, she would tell me that ""you have to keep your promises to live a happy life."" Now, she's grown up to be a beautiful, graceful, and highly successful young woman. Although the work of a legal adviser is complicated, she always seems so carefree. This puts my mind at ease."
Ganyu,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4,"I actually don't know her all that well — I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite ferocious. Whenever her temper gets the better of her, she is likely to start obliterating her surroundings. I wonder if she's just... bored. Should... Should I recommend some work to keep her occupied?"
Ganyu,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"Even though Ms. Yelan is absent from work for the majority of the year, I'm sure Lady Ningguang must have her reasons for making exceptions for her. Of course, it wouldn't be my place to ask, so I don't know the details of their arrangement. I remember seeing her one day on my way back to Yuehai Pavilion, she was having breakfast with a group of people — they were all talking and laughing, eating, drinking tea... I must admit, I found myself feeling a little envious in that moment."
Ganyu,More About Ganyu: I,"You have a last-minute job for me? Okay, uh... Sorry, please don't try and explain it all verbally... Write it down, leave a note here. I'll get to it as soon as possible."
Ganyu,More About Ganyu: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Let's see... ""I want to understand Ganyu better..."" Wh—What sort of request is that!? I've never done this before... Um, um, um... Okay... I can ah... run you through my annual review from last year? That should bring you up to speed on me... No good? Oh, okay then..."
Ganyu,More About Ganyu: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I've had a long, hard think, and I've realized that so long as it's for a work-related matter, there's really nothing for me to be embarrassed about. So if you really need to understand me more... This, uh, hairpiece... it's actually my horns. That's right. I'm part illuminated beast, qilin to be exact. Okay so, now we've got that out the way... Please sign this non-disclosure agreement for me. And don't tell a soul."
Ganyu,More About Ganyu: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Even though I'm part qilin, I'm still part human too. Still, all these years I've been asking myself the same question: Do I really belong in the human world? Maybe I'm just like a Dendro Slime hiding in the earth, burying myself in numbers and reports in order to escape reality."
Ganyu,More About Ganyu: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Thank you for always making time to chat with me. I feel like I must have spoken more after meeting you than I have in the last ten years put together. If I keep going like this... Maybe one day I'll be able to move on to something other than secretarial work. Now that I've got a few hundred years of experience under my belt, I should be able to avoid any more major mistakes."
Ganyu,Ganyu's Hobbies,"My hobby... I would say my job. What? Why don't jobs count as hobbies? I thought hobbies are supposed to be things you look forward to doing, and that make you feel good when you've done them? That describes my job perfectly. So what's the issue?"
Ganyu,Ganyu's Troubles,"I don't understand why people insist on going all out to try and prove how their existence is more valuable than everyone else's. To exist in the first place is a beautiful thing, and that's enough... isn't it?"
Ganyu,Favorite Food,"""Drink only spring water, eat only whole grains,"" that's my motto. So I would be grateful if you could please remove that treacherously enticing-looking plate of delicacies from my field of view. Much obliged!"
Ganyu,Least Favorite Food,"Qilins are strict vegetarians, so please do not take offense when I decline meat dishes. Yes, that includes your vegetable fritters since they have been fried in animal fat. Thanks, but I can't. I'm afraid I really can't. I don't mean to argue, it's just I have a keen sense of smell, so I know how they've been cooked."
Ganyu,Receiving a Gift: I,Such authentic delicacies... Oh no! I think I might have eaten too much...
Ganyu,Receiving a Gift: II,"I'm somewhat of a picky eater, sorry you went to all this trouble..."
Ganyu,Receiving a Gift: III,"I appreciate the thought, but... meat's not really my thing."
Ganyu,Birthday,"Many happy returns! After all the times you've looked out for me, I didn't even remember to get you a gift — whoops! Silly me, I... What's that behind my back? Ah. You saw it then. It's a failed attempt at making a Qingxin Flower cake... I wanted it to be perfect, but... Oh, you think it tastes good? Do you really?"
Ganyu,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Power? ...Now there's a key performance indicator I haven't needed in a long time.
Ganyu,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Could we maybe... find a peaceful resolution instead...? Never mind, doesn't matter..."
Ganyu,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I suppose this is the new way of life, then. I'm not going to complain. I'll try to embrace it."
Ganyu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I remember reading in an ancient text that ""Only when days be darker than the darkest night, may a qilin be compelled to fight."" That's a massive exaggeration... But should the time come for battle, and should you need me, then I will give it every ounce of my strength."
Gorou,Hello,"General Gorou of the Watatsumi Island resistance, ready and waiting! I've long heard of your sterling reputation and I look forward to fighting our way to victory side-by-side! ...Heh, so what do you think? Did that sound inspiring?"
Gorou,Chat: Tactics,Keep your weapon at the ready. You never know what's around the corner...
Gorou,Chat: Training,The fighting has ceased for now... Commence physical training!
Gorou,Chat: Physique,A strong body shows strength and instills confidence in others around you. I must always stay at the top of my game!
Gorou,When It Rains,"Ugh, my tail's getting wet... Let's find a fire and dry off."
Gorou,When Thunder Strikes,Stay alert!
Gorou,When It Snows,Whew *shivering*... it's cold. These conditions are unsuitable for outdoor maneuvers.
Gorou,When the Sun Is Out,"It'd be nice to just lie in the sun... Ahem, but I must set an example for the others."
Gorou,When the Wind Is Blowing,"We can attack downwind and press the advantage. Or, bolster our courage and fight upwind!"
Gorou,Good Morning,The sun is up and it is time to train. Shall we go climb a mountain?
Gorou,Good Afternoon,"Let's have Radish and Fish Stew with plain rice for lunch today. It's been a favorite among the troops lately, so I suggest you try it, too."
Gorou,Good Evening,"Though the sun is setting, our guard must remain high. We should let our eyes adapt to the dark... Even in the darkness of night, a battle may be looming."
Gorou,Good Night...,"If you're feeling fatigued, then best turn in for the night. I'll take watch! Don't worry, you have my word that everything will still be in good order on your return."
Gorou,About Gorou: Top Dog,"Huh? ""Top Dog Gorou""? Where did you hear that? *sigh* To be honest, I've grown quite close with my fellow officers, and always share any good news I might have with them. In private, they've all started calling me Top Dog out of respect... But in terms of age, they are all my seniors."
Gorou,About Gorou: Advice Friendship Lv. 4,"The troops seem to picture me as someone of extraordinary abilities — I think it might be because of our streak of victories lately. Now they always come to me for advice on even the most trivial matters. When I see the expectant look in their eyes, it's impossible for me to turn them away, but at the same time, my strategic ability is limited... All I can do is give some general pointers, or failing that, respond based on my gut feeling alone. *sigh* I just hope I'm not letting them down."
Gorou,About Us: Speaking Your Mind,"If there's anything ever troubling you, don't keep it all muzzled up inside. You can always speak your mind with me! Although I can't guarantee that I'll always have an answer, I'll certainly offer you my best advice! Even when I can't muster much of a response, you can always count on me to be a good listener. Whatever it is, I'm all ears."
Gorou,About Us: Camaraderie Friendship Lv. 6,"We train together, eat together, and relax together. There's no better way to strengthen communication and build tacit understanding between everyone on the team. In the heat of battle, just a simple glance can transmit crucial information. Hmm? You don't think it's very appropriate? Huh... Well, I mean, that's how the troops and I have been bonding as a team."
Gorou,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"My Vision amplifies my abilities in battle. It allows me to take greater responsibility on the battlefield and forge a way forward for the troops. But I also understand that one person alone, no matter how strong, is never enough to turn the tide of a battle. The key to victory is everyone's united effort, fighting for a common cause."
Gorou,Something to Share: Dressed for Battle,"I don't like to enter battle wearing lots of heavy equipment. I travel light, that's my style. My strength is in moving quickly around the battlefield, seeking out opportunities to take control of the fight. I always target the strongest warriors first to weaken the enemy's morale."
Gorou,Something to Share: Ever-Victorious General Friendship Lv. 4,"The troops have come up with a nickname for me, the ""ever-victorious pointy-eared general."" Now there's even a rumor going around saying that ""if you want Top Dog Gorou's victorious luck, give his pointy ears a rub."" Grrr, there will be no rubbing of my ears, and that's final. If they think they can smile their way into persuading me otherwise, well, they've got another thing... Hmm? Hey, wh—what are you doing? Not you too...? Come on now, I... I thought I... Mm.... Mm..."
Gorou,Interesting Things,"I've heard that there's a mountain range in Liyue that reaches all the way up into the clouds. Ah, I'd relish a chance to go climbing there!"
Gorou,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to."
Gorou,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4,"I've seen all kinds of wandering samurai before, and Kazuha is categorically a different breed from the others. He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!"
Gorou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Duties Friendship Lv. 4,"As the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan. It is then my duty to put every detail of the plan into action and to keep the situation under control on the front line. We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory."
Gorou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Attitude Friendship Lv. 4,"I have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much."
Gorou,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Grr, the Raiden Shogun... I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line."
Gorou,"About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","I have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate."
Gorou,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her..."
Gorou,"About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her."
Gorou,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then."
Gorou,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"You mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose."
Gorou,More About Gorou: I,"Hmm, I'm afraid that most of my days have been spent on the battlefield, so there's not much to tell about me. But if you'd really like to hear my stories, I'm happy to sit down and tell you everything!"
Gorou,More About Gorou: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now."
Gorou,"More About Gorou: III Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","At first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance."
Gorou,More About Gorou: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Her Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?"
Gorou,More About Gorou: V Friendship Lv. 6,"We are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you."
Gorou,Gorou's Hobbies,"I love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold. Better yet is climbing mountains with fellow companions. After hours of dirt and sweat scaling the summit, we can sit down and enjoy the view together. It's one of life's greatest joys! Ahem, however, I have absolutely no desire to scale the tallest peak in Inazuma..."
Gorou,Gorou's Troubles,"There are times when being lightly armored has its shortcomings... For example, I have to be particularly careful of my tail when the enemy attacks with fire."
Gorou,Favorite Food,"My favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!"
Gorou,Least Favorite Food,"I'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception. One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing. The soldiers from logistics felt terrible about it, too."
Gorou,Receiving a Gift: I,Mm! I become powerless in the face of sweets!
Gorou,Receiving a Gift: II,"Oh, I feel invigorated! Is there anything I can help you with?"
Gorou,Receiving a Gift: III,It's a little spicier than I expected... *sniff* I—I don't think I can keep going.
Gorou,Birthday,"Today's a momentous occasion, your birthday! Allow me to arrange all the celebrations for you! We can make a bonfire on the beach and catch some fresh fish and crabs. I'll personally prepare a morale-boosting meal that would make even the highest-ranking generals jealous."
Gorou,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"With this newfound strength, I will defend those who fight alongside me."
Gorou,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Protecting my soldiers doesn't just mean having a robust defense in place. Sometimes, it means going on the attack!"
Gorou,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"The key to seizing victory in battle lies in remembering the meaning of battle and employing the right tactics to generate momentum, making your forces unstoppable."
Gorou,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"With momentum on our side and close camaraderie, we are unstoppable. Thank you for your guidance. This is a victory that belongs to the both of us."
Hu Tao,Hello,"Yoh, now why might you be looking for me, hm? Oh, you didn't know? I'm the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, Hu Tao. Though by the looks of you... Radiant glow, healthy posture...

Hu Tao,About Us: Battle Friendship Lv. 6,"Fighting's a pain. For me, it's not an objective so much as a means to an end. Using the means to reach the end, to fight for that which I will not compromise on — it's in this way that you and I are the same."
Hu Tao,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Vision... Vision...? Oh, this thing? Yeah, whatever..."
Hu Tao,Something to Share,"We are entrusted by the people to loyally see out their wishes. Wangsheng Funeral Parlor is special, in that it carries a dual responsibility, to those both of this realm, and the next."

Hu Tao,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4,"What would I know of the adepti? Ai-yai-yai, that kind of stuff is top-secret! Don't come asking me about it!"
Hu Tao,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4,"The Yuheng, Keqing... she's quite hard to talk to. She's so uptight, hehe... Really makes me wanna mess with her. She wouldn't knock me in the head with her sword though, right? Or would she...?"
Hu Tao,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"Xiangling's a riot! Only a little ""boo"" and she jumps, she's so easy to scare! Being in the industry that I am, I just love these kinds of people the most. Gotta keep it in check though, in case Guoba ends up toasting me instead."
Hu Tao,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"Yun Jin always appears so graceful on formal occassions, but you'd be surprised how friendly she is in private! I made a bet with her once, and the loser had to sing lyrics of the winner's choice in their own singing style. My my, I wish you could have heard her operatic version of the Hilitune!"
Hu Tao,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4,"She is quite the fascinating individual, completely different from anyone else I've encountered. Do you think if I started eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains every single day, I'd be able to look as pure and pristine as she does?"
Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: I,"♪Silly-churl, billy-churl, silly-billy hilichurl. Frilly-churl, willy-churl, frilly-willy hilichurl♪ Ah, hehe..."
Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: II Friendship Lv. 3,Versemonger of the darkest alleys — that's me!
Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: III Friendship Lv. 4,"If you ask me, there's nothing hard or scary about working at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, it's just a pain is all. It's a shame — others see us going out to work at night and just don't understand — and that's what scares them. *sigh* You all just don't understand!"
Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I'm Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's 77th Funeral Director, my grandfather was the 75th. First thing I took over was funeral affairs. Haha, surprising huh? And just like that, it's already been a few years... Time really does go by so quickly."
Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Balance must be maintained, and yet destinies remain variable. Death has its own rules, and yet is still hard to predict. Remember — no matter where, no matter when, no matter what the reason — one should never poke fun at death. Only once you know and respect death can you truly understand the value of life."
Hu Tao,Hu Tao's Hobbies,"A bright moon aloft amid the vast, clear skies... Moments like these are just perfect for writing poetry."
Hu Tao,Hu Tao's Troubles,*sigh* I gotta find something fun to do... Sitting around doing nothing is a fate worse than death.
Hu Tao,Favorite Food,♪La~la~la~ Steamed fish with a side of prawn dumplings~
Hu Tao,Least Favorite Food,Qingxin Slime Condensate... Bleugh... Surely this is Xiangling getting payback...
Hu Tao,Receiving a Gift: I,"Splendid, splendid! Now, allow me to compose a poem in loving memory of this dish."
Hu Tao,Receiving a Gift: II,"Sure you don't want my help? C'mon, it's a great deal: cook twice the amount in the same time!"
Hu Tao,Receiving a Gift: III,"Ugh, I declare this dish dead, rest in peace."
Hu Tao,Birthday,"Tonight the stars are dazzling and the moon majestic, it must be a special day... But just what day could it be... Haha, I know, I know! It's your birthday! It really is a great day."

Hu Tao,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Yeah, this is good, thanks!"
Hu Tao,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I never imagined that I, Hu Tao, could ever be like this. Energy like a rushing torrent, a heart soaring like a gliding eagle! I feel great!"
Hu Tao,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"If I reach my full physical potential, then the next test is of the heart. It's largely thanks to you that I've been able to step foot into this uncharted territory. It is here that heart and soul are as one like clouds. Death is a constant for all among the multitudes that sit beneath the heavens."
Jean,Hello,"I am Jean, the Dandelion Knight, requesting approval to join your party. From this day onwards, my honor and loyalty lie with you."
Jean,Chat: Operation,"It's time to move on, we shouldn't stay here."
Jean,Chat: Knights of Favonius,I do hope the Knights of Favonius are all working hard...

Jean,Good Morning,A successful day starts from the morning. Let's give it our all today.
Jean,Good Afternoon,We've still got work to do. Let's keep going.
Jean,Good Evening,It seems I'm immune to coffee now. Perhaps I need to ask Lisa for something... a little stronger...
Jean,Good Night,"Training is finished for today. Great work, you've earned a good rest."
Jean,About Jean,"Today I had no choice but to cut down five Ruin Guards to protect the people of our city... Ugh, I must continue to work harder. Though hostile, destroying such precious artifacts is still a loss to us all. I must find a less destructive way to bring them down next time..."
Jean,About Us: Creed,"You have my complete and full support. Of course, if your path ever deviates from justice, I will not hesitate to point it out."
Jean,About Us: Oath Friendship Lv. 6,"I swear by this sword, victory shall be yours."
Jean,About Us: Quest Friendship Lv. 6,"Our work will not handle itself... But, I suppose the occasional short break is warranted. Let us rest for a couple of minutes."
Jean,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"""For Mondstadt, as always"" is the Gunnhildr family motto. Every time I use my Vision, I am reminded of my mother and the hopes of the people of Mondstadt. For Mondstadt, for freedom — that is what I fight for."
Jean,Something to Share,"On behalf of the Knights of Favonius, I would like to extend my gratitude to you for all you have done for Mondstadt. Please remember to rest from time to ti... Did I miss something? What are you laughing at? Did I say something odd?"
Jean,Interesting Things,"""Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land."" Who knows, the wind might take it all the way to Celestia."
Jean,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"Barbara is a hard worker, but I feel she's too hard on herself sometimes... What? You ask me how I know all this? It's because the order also manages the Church."
Jean,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"When Lisa is around, I always have peace of mind."
Jean,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"I must say that Amber's development has impressed me recently. I hope that one day, her deeds will become the words of a bard's tale."
Jean,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,Is that right...? Kaeya also gave you some suggestions. He is an excellent knight after all — this is a fact no one can deny.
Jean,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Though it may be said that it is in a child's nature to play, the things Klee plays with are far from toys. I can never take my eyes off her."
Jean,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Sometimes I feel that terms like ""genius"" were originally created for Albedo."
Jean,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"Grand Master Varka is the legend of his generation. On the day of his triumphant return, I shall be sure to personally introduce you to him. I'm sure you too will be in awe of his greatness."
Jean,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"Noelle... She puts enormous effort into trying to become a Knight of Favonius. However, I fear she is not quite ready for the dangers that lie beyond Mondstadt's walls.(Actual Voice-Over: Noelle... She puts enormous effort into trying to become a Knight of Favonius. However, I fear she is not quite ready for the dangers that lie beyond Mondstadt's walls.)"
Jean,About Rosaria Friendship Lv. 4,"Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help, to which she simply replied that doing so would be even more bothersome. I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt."
Jean,About Diluc: Disillusion Friendship Lv. 4,"Master Diluc has his reasons for being so critical of the Knights of Favonius. I am not proud of the way things went, but I cannot change the past. All I can do is keep working hard, in the hope he may one day see us in a better light... This is my duty."
Jean,About Diluc: Respect Friendship Lv. 4,"Master Diluc is my senior, and I have the utmost respect for him. Though we have gone separate ways, I can sense we share the same strong commitment to protecting Mondstadt at all costs."
Jean,About Sucrose Friendship Lv. 4,"Sucrose is also a rare talent in the field of alchemy. Under Albedo's mentorship, she is sure to flourish. I am sure her future will be bright. The only thing is... Ahem, I was momentarily lost in thought. It is nothing. Nothing bad, anyway."
Jean,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"Eula? Um... Please, do not hold her unfortunate background against her. The Knights of Favonius evaluate each person impartially. Eula has a clear sense of right and wrong and is more talented than most. The controversial statements that she makes from time to time are just a product of her personality. For instance, she always mentions wanting to challenge me, but I don't mind."
Jean,About Mika Friendship Lv. 4,"The Grand Master placed Mika on the front line of the expedition team not simply because he met the requirements of the mission — more importantly, he was impressed by Mika's hardworking and grounded nature. From my own perspective, I feel very honored to work with someone like him."
Jean,More About Jean: I,"I shoulder the knights' trust and the people's hope. It is for this reason, I must stay vigilant."
Jean,More About Jean: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Vennessa's title — ""Dandelion Knight"" — has been passed down from generation to generation. Countless great knights were awarded with this honor and I will not bring shame to this name. Thus, I must keep going. I must become the sword and aegis of the people."
Jean,More About Jean: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Only glorious victories are recorded in legends and history books. Surely even the great knights of old must have had their struggles?Wind, please show me the path."
Jean,More About Jean: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"When I'm wholeheartedly devoted to my work, all of my troubles and and even my sense of time seem to just slip away. Hmm, Grand Master Varka did say to me: ""Jean, there is no better candidate for this task""..."
Jean,More About Jean: V Friendship Lv. 6,"As I walk with you, the path ahead becomes clearer. It's almost as if I have finally found someone I can trust, I wonder if...No, this must mean that I am still lacking in strength... I must not give up, I will not — I cannot fail the knights and the people of Mondstadt. Still... thank you."
Jean,Jean's Hobbies,Maybe we can discuss the tales of legendary heroes. Have you heard the story of the heroic king of Khaenri'ah?
Jean,Jean's Troubles,If only there was some kind of mysterious potion that could keep me awake forever... I need to have a talk with Lisa tomorrow.
Jean,Favorite Food,It's been ages since I had a pizza at Cat's Tail. If only they delivered...
Jean,Least Favorite Food,A true knight can't afford to be a picky eater.
Jean,Receiving a Gift: I,"Not only is the taste magnificent, but you've also made sure it was healthy. You have my gratitude."
Jean,Receiving a Gift: II,"Hmm yes, I feel a lot more energetic now, thanks to you."
Jean,Receiving a Gift: III,"Ahem... all in all, I appreciate the effort."
Jean,Birthday,"Today is a day worth celebrating. If you must ask why, well, let me remind you that today is when you, the one who is blessed by the wind, came into the world.

My gratitude...Wind, please forgive my selfishness. Not as the Acting Grand Master, but as Jean - I hereby swear that my sword shall always go with you."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Hello,"""Come driving rain or winds that churn, I shall return, by blade alone, armed, if barefoot, to my home..."" I am Kaedehara Kazuha, a wanderer who roams the land. Since we are both travelers, let us journey together for a time."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Chat: Nature,This scenery is wonderful... Surely enough to convince anyone to become a wanderer.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Chat: Playing a Tune,"There are leaves around — and I know just the tune to accompany them, if you wish to hear it."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Chat: Bladework,"Wherever in this world I roam, I carry memories of my home... This blade... It is the last link I have to the land of my birth."
Kaedehara Kazuha,When It Rains,Taking a stroll in the middle of a downpour certainly rouses the spirit... but it's best to dry your clothes as soon as possible after the rain stops.
Kaedehara Kazuha,When Thunder Strikes,"Compared to the storms I've encountered out at sea, this is really quite tame."
Kaedehara Kazuha,When It Snows,I love it when it snows. The world falls completely silent... and I can sleep undisturbed.
Kaedehara Kazuha,When the Sun Is Out,Clear weather all around brightens the heart.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Good Morning,The birdsong at daybreak is nature's gift to us. Let us go. Our journey begins anew.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Good Afternoon,...The midday sun has a way of making one yearn for a moment of sleep. What say we find ourselves a place to rest?
Kaedehara Kazuha,Good Evening,"I gaze up at the moon and lend my ear to the gentle breeze, with wine in my cup and peace in my heart... Have a wonderful evening."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Good Night,"The wind has ceased... The world is silent, so now is the best time to rest well. See you tomorrow."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Sailing,"In truth, not every night out at sea is filled with wind and waves. When the weather is clear, the moonlight flows over the rippling water, and schools of fish circle the ship's hull. At moments like that, when I look out into the distance from the prow, I feel like this journey is worth it... The only thing that takes away from that feeling is the sailors' singing. They're so loud... don't they need to sleep?"
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Samurai Nobility,"The Kaedehara Clan was once a famed samurai clan. It's a pity that by the time the noble name passed to me, the title itself was all that was left. But it is enough for me. A samurai has no need of a lavish life — we find all that we need in wine, song, and the blade in our hands."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Us: Going Out to Sea,What say you join me out at sea someday when the weather's fine?
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Us: Frank Speech Friendship Lv. 6,"I like frank people, because we can freely speak our minds to one another. There is no need to hide anything that you wish to say. I hear the voices of all things in nature, and that includes yours."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"As I see it, a Vision is the proof of one's strength, not the source of it. It symbolizes the mortal desire to always keep moving forward, but in this endeavor, we samurai place our faith in our blades alone."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Something to Share: Bamboo Blades Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, you'd like to learn the art of the sword? Let me see... Alright — here, take this. It's a bamboo blade I just made. With these, we can practice sparring without having to worry about getting injured."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Something to Share: Maple Leaves Friendship Lv. 4,"""On this mountain path, where the red leaves lifeless lie... My heart calls for a companion, echoing the deer's cry..."" Hm... I do love maple leaves, but it is a shame that so many goodbyes seem to happen when they turn red."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Interesting Things,"Farewell, dear gulls, please calm your cries. From this day forth, I am a wanderer once more."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,I owe Beidou my life. She took me in when I fled from Inazuma and gave me the courage to return there at the most difficult time of my life. She is a comrade in whom I and all the other sailors can place our trust.
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,"When I was a wanted man, the resistance gave me a lot of help. The time I spent with Gorou was brief, but he left a deep impression on me. He's the type of person who says whatever's on his mind. He shares the highs and lows of his subordinates, and is never afraid to draw his sword for the sake of a friend. That's the kind of person I can really get along with."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"She defeated my friend in a duel before the throne, which I accept as proof of her great strength. But she uses that strength to serve as an oppressor's lackey, leading the Kujou Clan's troops to relentlessly seek out and confiscate Visions. This... I cannot forgive."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kujou Sara: Changing Perspective Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,I see... So she does have her own ideals that she is fighting for. But I have to wonder: can the Kujou family flourish as they did before once this storm has passed?
Kaedehara Kazuha,"About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves","I've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the ""Shirasagi Himegimi."" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?"
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"The last time she commissioned Captain Beidou to ship fireworks to Liyue, I unloaded the shipment myself. They were so heavy! I doubt that anyone besides her could make such huge fireworks."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4,"During my time with the Resistance, there was no one among our ranks who wouldn't look up to Her Excellency. As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?"
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"Don't be deceived by his happy-go-lucky disposition. As soon as he gets working on a case, that restless energy he carries around turns into a razor-sharp focus. It's quite remarkable to witness."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: I,"You'd like to know more about me, you say? Well, as you see, I am but a wandering samurai that you could have run into just about anywhere."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I have a very keen sense of hearing. My ears pick up all sorts of sounds: the wind through the mountain passes, the parting clouds, the sound of foxes chewing on apples in the forest, the sound of crabs blowing bubbles... This is nature's favor, it allows me to sense danger long before it draws near."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I used to love the rain when I was small. The sound of it would lull me into a peaceful sleep. But since I've grown older, my feelings have become more... complicated. I still like to listen to the rain today, but whenever I see the storm clouds start to gather, my heart sinks and I can't help but wonder: ""Hm... will some nice person let me stay the night today?"" Listening to the rain in drenched clothes is hardly peaceful — hehe... nothing can be when you're constantly interrupting yourself by sneezing."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I never stay in a single place for very long. Stagnancy dulls both my connection with nature and the blade I wield. While I am still able to, I want to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of different people."
Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Don't worry — even if the day comes for us to go our separate ways, I am certain that we will meet again, in some corner of the world. The fate that brings people together is not a cord so easily cut."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Kaedehara Kazuha's Hobbies,"I like falling asleep on a warm rock that's been soaking in the mid-afternoon sun, then waking up and continuing on my journey with no particular aim in mind. So long as I have my blade by my side, there is nowhere I cannot go."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Kaedehara Kazuha's Troubles,"The sounds of nature turn into a clamor of noise during stormy weather. It becomes a constant buzz in my ears. If it happens at night, I end up tossing and turning all night long without getting a wink of sleep. It's quite the headache..."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Favorite Food,"The most easily obtainable food source when you're out at sea is, of course, fish. So it goes without saying that a seafaring adventurer must give careful consideration to how to cook a tasty fish-based meal... If the chance arises, I'd like you to try some of my cooking."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Least Favorite Food,"I am not particularly fond of food that is thrown together in a hurry without much care and attention. The way I see it, if your meal consists of a single fish, you should grill it to perfection. Eating is supposed to be an enjoyable experience, so how can we stand to be so slapdash about it?"
Kaedehara Kazuha,Receiving a Gift: I,That you can make fish taste as delicious as this is proof of your outstanding culinary prowess.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Receiving a Gift: II,"Your cooking not only fills the stomach, it also soothes my soul."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Receiving a Gift: III,Perhaps you should get some rest? A weary mind is a recipe for flavorless food.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Birthday,"I heard it was your birthday, so I wrote a haiku for you. Unfortunately, I'm not the most talented in this area, and after trying for several evenings, I was still only able to come up with the first two lines... I guess I'll just share what I've got so far, then. ""Sun and moon rejoice / Birds of dawn sing songs anew""... Wait, don't say a word, I think the final line is coming to me... Yes, how about.... ""Far from home, with you."" Anyway, Happy Birthday. Let's go and get you some cake, shall we?"
Kaedehara Kazuha,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,My blade grows keener.
Kaedehara Kazuha,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"The sound of snow as it lands on the ground is so faint as to be practically nonexistent... But now, my senses are sharper than ever, and I believe I should be able to discern it."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"The waves rise high out in the open seas. I, too, must reach new heights of strength."
Kaedehara Kazuha,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"As one travels the world, sorrows and frustrations are bound to journey with you. But I find that I've grown since meeting you, both in martial arts and in strength of character. I am confident that I will be more at ease in life from this point forth."
Kaeya,Hello,"Kaeya, Knight of Favonius. Please, allow me to join you on your journey. Guarding you on your journey sounds far more entertaining than any of the usual Favonius stuff."
Kaeya,Chat: Nothing to Do,I didn't know you were such a slacker.
Kaeya,Chat: Knights of Favonius,"Hehe, seems all the other knights already have their hands full."
Kaeya,Chat: Laziness,"Come on, let's get moving. We're not frozen in place, after all."
Kaeya,When It Rains,Cryo is always far more effective in the rain. This is going to get interesting...
Kaeya,When It Snows: Anecdote,How about a ghost story to go with the snow?
Kaeya,When It Snows: Cold,What's wrong? Can't handle the cold?
Kaeya,When It's Windy,"What a pleasant breeze, I wonder how long it'll last?"
Kaeya,Good Morning,Seize the day.
Kaeya,Good Afternoon,"Hey, fancy joining me at the tavern for a bit?"
Kaeya,Good Evening,"You're not scared of the dark, are you? That's... interesting."
Kaeya,Good Night,"Leaving already? See you next time then, don't make me wait too long though."
Kaeya,About Kaeya,"Is the Abyss Order causing you trouble? If there's anything bothering you, you know you can talk to me."
Kaeya,About Us: Employment Relationship,"If you ever need me, let me know. Let's not make this a transaction relationship."
Kaeya,About Us: Strength Friendship Lv. 6,"Oh? Well, if you're concerned about keeping things professional... maybe you can find more use for me on the front lines. How 'bout it boss? Haha, just don't feel intimidated by what I can do."
Kaeya,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Still struggling with how Visions work? Let's see... How can I explain it... The apparatus that allows us to see is our eyes. A Vision is the apparatus by which we control the elements. Simple, is it not?"
Kaeya,Something to Share,"Do you drink wine? Dandelion wine has a unique body to it. Oh, you're underage? You should try Mondstadt's apple cider vinegar. I know just the place."
Kaeya,Interesting Things,"Have you ever seen the owl of Dragonspine? If you look directly at it, it seems to see right through you, while letting go of none of its own secrets... Quite fascinating, don't you think?"
Kaeya,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,What? The Acting Grand Master? You need to give her your full support.
Kaeya,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,Oh Lisa. Hmm... You'd better not forget to return your books on time. I made that mistake once and boy was she angry. My arm is still numb from last time...
Kaeya,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,That Outrider is a clever and righteous knight. Be careful not to step out of line in front of her.
Kaeya,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"Diluc? He was cute as a young lad. But nowadays he just seems to be in a world of his own... Overall, not much fun to hang out with."
Kaeya,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Klee. Seems she has failed to elude the Acting Grand Master's investigative skills, despite the pointers I gave her... Haha, I'm kidding, no need to go reporting me or anything."
Kaeya,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Albedo, eh? Calm, collected, and incredibly talented. He's the type everybody likes, some even more so than others. What, you into him as well?"
Kaeya,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,"Have you tried one of Diona's drinks? Oh right, you're still underage. Haha, such a shame, it truly is — to not be able to revel with you in such bliss. Hehe, I guess all we can do is wait for you to be old enough."
Kaeya,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"Now that you mention him, it is a shame there is no one in the Knights of Favonius to inherit the Grand Master's approach to his work. *sigh* I must say I really do appreciate people like him."
Kaeya,About Fischl Friendship Lv. 4,"What? You think Fischl having one eye covered is very fitting given her title of Prinzessin der Verurteilung. Hahaha, if that's the case, that must make me a future royal progeny too, no?"
Kaeya,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"I was entrusted by the Acting Grand Master to work in the background to support Noelle, but there hasn't been much for me to concern myself with — she has a good head on her shoulders. Quite the relief."
Kaeya,About Rosaria Friendship Lv. 4,"Ahaha, you want to know about the secrets of Sister Rosaria? That... I cannot tell you. Though my impression of her is not bad — certainly better than a certain someone whose name I won't bother to mention. She's honest with herself. She casts off that which she has no time for and she doesn't feign motivation for affairs that do not interest her."
Kaeya,About Sucrose Friendship Lv. 4,"Sucrose may not be much of an extrovert in public, but as they say — it's always the quiet ones... Apparently, her laboratory is home to quite the eclectic range of implements and her experiments are more than just intellectually stimulating... All hearsay, of course. You don't seriously think I would go snooping around a fair lady's private quarters, do you?"
Kaeya,About Collei Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, Collei? Oho, now there's a name I haven't heard in a while... You came to the right person! Let me tell you her whole story, starting right from the very beginning, with all the delicious details!"
Kaeya,About Mika Friendship Lv. 4,"When I first met Mika, he seemed like the nervous type, so I decided to joke around with him a little. I didn't count on that making him even more nervous... His smile looked as if it were plastered onto his face, and in the end, he even wrote me a letter of apology. Tsk-tsk. Does taking everything so seriously run in the Schmidts' blood?"
Kaeya,More About Kaeya: I,"The title of Cavalry Captain is nothing to get excited about. Now that I think about it, the Grand Master took all the cavalry from Mondstadt so there's none left for me to captain... Heh."
Kaeya,More About Kaeya: II Friendship Lv. 3,"There are a total of ten captains within the Knights of Favonius. But truth be told, not all of them have what it takes to be leaders."
Kaeya,More About Kaeya: III Friendship Lv. 4,"My eye? My eye is fine. There's nothing unusual about hiding one's body parts from view. It's the same reason I wear pants... or any other item of clothing, for that matter."
Kaeya,More About Kaeya: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Khaenri'ah, huh? You sure know a lot! The legacy of Khaenri'ah is long gone, the sinners are all that's left, and they're not worth mentioning."
Kaeya,More About Kaeya: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I didn't realize we'd known each other for so long now. Time flies! You know, following you on your journey might just be the most fun I've had in my whole life. I hope it stays that way."
Kaeya,Kaeya's Hobbies,"Wine tasting is an art form. Mondstadt's wine is a gift from the Anemo Archon, it's only right that one should learn how to appreciate it."
Kaeya,Kaeya's Troubles,"Lonely? Me? Not with someone here nagging me all the time, that's for sure."
Kaeya,Favorite Food,"Sparkling wine is a specialty of Mondstadt. Mix it with three parts Dandelion Wine and the bitterness disappears completely. This concoction is known as ""Death After Noon."" Delectable."
Kaeya,Least Favorite Food,"I can't believe that some people actually drink grape juice... if they had a little more patience, they would find that it ferments into the most exquisite wine. Hmph. So unromantic."
Kaeya,Receiving a Gift: I,Ho! This is quite exceptional... You are full of surprises.
Kaeya,Receiving a Gift: II,"You should serve this with wine, it would really add the finishing touch."
Kaeya,Receiving a Gift: III,"I'm just a slow eater... I'll finish it, don't worry."
Kaeya,Birthday,"Today is a day worth celebrating, I hope this day can bring you true happiness."
Kaeya,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Hmm. Not bad.
Kaeya,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,You always seem to be around to give me a hand. Thanks.
Kaeya,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Hmm, seems I'm getting stronger. I say, how is it you seem happier than me about it?"
Kaeya,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"We were just traveling partners. I never thought I'd have you to thank for getting me to this point. Seems I really should respond in kind. Let us carry on, partner. The road ahead is still long."
Kamisato Ayaka,Hello,"Master of Inazuma Kamisato Art Tachi Jutsu — Kamisato Ayaka, present!Delighted to make your acquaintance."
Kamisato Ayaka,Chat: Stability,I only wish life could be as leisurely as this a little more often... How greedy of me.
Kamisato Ayaka,Chat: Sword,A blade is like a tea-leaf. Only those who sample it many times can appreciate its true qualities.
Kamisato Ayaka,Chat: Zoning Out,"So this is a day in the life of the Traveler... Hehe, I'm learning more about you all the time."
Kamisato Ayaka,Chat: Famous Sword,A blade embraces its duty as a jeweler cherishes their gems.
Kamisato Ayaka,When It Rains,"Come with me, let us find shelter from the rain."
Kamisato Ayaka,When Thunder Strikes,Her Excellency... What is she trying to communicate?
Kamisato Ayaka,When It Snows,"""Snow that once adorned the world in silver, thaws to reveal the gleam of the fruit upon frost-laden branches."" *sigh* How picturesque! Only some tea would make this setting more complete."
Kamisato Ayaka,When the Sun Is Out,"There's a pleasant breeze and glorious sunshine... So, where shall we go for a walk?"
Kamisato Ayaka,When It's Windy,"Close your eyes and face the wind... It feels wonderful, doesn't it?"
Kamisato Ayaka,Good Morning,"Oh, good morning, Traveler. ...Whenever I see you in the morning, somehow, it makes me feel like... today is going to be a good day."
Kamisato Ayaka,Good Afternoon,"Good afternoon. It is normal to feel drowsy after lunch, might I interest you in a game of Go to stimulate the mind?"
Kamisato Ayaka,Good Evening,Greetings. An auspicious breeze blows this evening. Tonight will be peaceful.
Kamisato Ayaka,Good Night,"""Was it one's thoughts that drew him to my dreams? Had I known it a dream, one would not have awakened."" Hehe, I love that poem."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Kamisato Ayaka: Yashiro Commission,"""Inazuma Shogunate, Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Clan."" Widely known as one of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma, it is the branch of the Tri-Commission that manages ceremonial and cultural affairs. Since my parents passed, Brother and I assumed responsibility for all clan matters, big and small."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Kamisato Ayaka: Position Friendship Lv. 4,"Many look up to me as the Shirasagi Himegimi and as the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. But the object of their respect has everything to do with my position, and nothing at all to do with me, Ayaka. It makes me think that... maybe, there is only one person I know who is truly able to get close to me..."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Kamisato Ayaka: Aspiration Friendship Lv. 6,"Today, as in the past, I aspire to be somebody whom everyone can trust. But what motivates me is no longer the responsibilities I shoulder, or the expectations of other people. Rather, it is the fact that you are this kind of person, too."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Us: Teahouse,"If you've got time, shall we take a walk to Komore Teahouse? To chat about the art of tea on a pleasant day like this seems like the sophisticated thing to do."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Us: Festivals Friendship Lv. 6 The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit,"If I ever have the chance, I would very much like to experience the festivities of another nation with you one day. Though, I will need some guidance on local customs and etiquette, and advice on what gifts to bring... Could I trouble you to give me some guidance?"
Kamisato Ayaka,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions are a seal of approval for those who are most ambitious. As for my own ambitions, they shall remain private for now. It is nothing more than an insignificant dream."
Kamisato Ayaka,Something to Share,"It is said that ""the flavor of Zen is that of tea,"" and it is also said that ""the power of Zen is that of the blade."" One might then ask: What does that say about the relationship between tea and the blade?"
Kamisato Ayaka,Interesting Things,"Have you ever noticed the withering sakura tree in the city? For me, there is a beauty to the withering, it brings back fond memories of the spring. Most people don't agree — sakura trees that will never bloom again are removed. But when I look at a tree, all I want is to see it blossom again... just one more time..."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4,"Thoma is a dear friend. He always lifts my spirits with his sunny disposition. In a sense, I think of him as another brother, and as a full member of the Kamisato Clan."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Kujou Sara of the Tenryou Commission is... not known to smile, and I have had my fair share of disputes with her. She is, however, a loyal servant to Inazuma, there is no question about that."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"Mr. Shikanoin belongs to the Tenryou Commission, just like Miss Kujou. He is very... principled, sometimes even more determinedly so than Miss Kujou. The only thing is, when it comes to the question of which matters should be governed by his principles, I believe only Mr. Shikanoin himself knows the answer..."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, little Sayu. She hasn't been causing you any trouble lately, has she? Hehe, if you ever notice her slacking off, please let me know."
Kamisato Ayaka,About the Raiden Shogun: Guesswork Friendship Lv. 4,"The Almighty Shogun? It would be improper of me to comment, given that I am one of her subjects. All I will say is that... I think that Her Excellency must get lonely on the road to eternity."
Kamisato Ayaka,"About the Raiden Shogun: Standpoint(For English, this line does not feature audio.) Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over Mortals","To witness the Musou no Hitotachi and live to tell the tale is quite a remarkable feat. Even though I recognize her as our true deity with the power to change Inazuma's fate at will, if there is conflict between the two of you, then... I shall choose to side with you."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"I have always greatly enjoyed working with Guuji Yae. Organizing festival affairs generally takes a lot of effort and doesn't generate much income, but Guuji Yae's events always come off both elegant and profitable."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4,"As the head of the Kamisato Clan, brother always has a full schedule of places he needs to be. I do try my best to share his load, but there is no changing the pressure he is subjected to all year round, and the toll it takes upon him. *sigh* If you see him, remind him to take care of himself, for his sister's sake..."
Kamisato Ayaka,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"The Yashiro Commission and the shrine maidens are responsible for festival affairs, and Yoimiya, as a fireworks expert, knows how to create an atmosphere. So we have become well acquainted with her over the years.Hmm? Public order and fire prevention? We factor these concerns in well in advance during the planning stage. To deny people the chance to see fireworks simply for these reasons would leave them feeling very disappointed."
Kamisato Ayaka,"More About Kamisato Ayaka: I Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","Your request is quite unusual for me. Since I see you as a friend, it would only be fair to be open and honest with you, but if this means sharing secrets of the Kamisato Clan... I would ask that you keep anything I tell you in strict confidence."
Kamisato Ayaka,"More About Kamisato Ayaka: II Friendship Lv. 3 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","The Kamisato Clan once suffered a major blow when we failed to protect a swordsmith of national significance. We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance."
Kamisato Ayaka,"More About Kamisato Ayaka: III Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan."
Kamisato Ayaka,"More About Kamisato Ayaka: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more."
Kamisato Ayaka,"More About Kamisato Ayaka: V Friendship Lv. 6 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","What I want to say next is perhaps not befitting of a member of the Inazuma Shogunate, Yashiro Commission, Kamisato Clan, but... unless I am mistaken, I trust that you will not take issue with this slight departure from convention on my part...That is to say... I'm a little tired, may I rest my head on your shoulder? Just for a moment."
Kamisato Ayaka,Kamisato Ayaka's Hobbies,"I have great affection for the arts: music, song, poetry, shougi, and dancing. And you?"
Kamisato Ayaka,Kamisato Ayaka's Troubles: Concerns,"Troubles? Well, I mean... that's life, isn't it? There will always be things that don't go one's way. But I do not wish to worry those around me on account of things that are my concern alone... so, it is best if I keep them to myself."
Kamisato Ayaka,Kamisato Ayaka's Troubles: Desires Friendship Lv. 6,"Openness is something I find very difficult. I constantly have to remind myself that as a lady of the Kamisato Clan, there are countless people watching and countless expectations to live up to. I must be a model of exemplary conduct at all times. But even so, shouldn't I still follow my dreams? Shouldn't I... share my true feelings with you?"
Kamisato Ayaka,Favorite Food,"I'm fascinated by food from overseas. Though I don't get to try it very often... So, if I had to choose something from Inazuma, then probably... Chazuke. But not when anybody else is watching... So I tell you that in confidence."
Kamisato Ayaka,Least Favorite Food,"Though I do not eschew animal fat and organs entirely, they are far from my first choice."
Kamisato Ayaka,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm... Yes, I am truly fortunate..."
Kamisato Ayaka,Receiving a Gift: II,Thank you for the opportunity to try this dish. I will always savor it.
Kamisato Ayaka,Receiving a Gift: III,Hmm... It's a bit greasy for my taste.
Kamisato Ayaka,Birthday,"Come with me! We're not going far away — I promise it won't delay you too much.I managed to find out when your birthday was well in advance, so I could prepare in good time. Hopefully this wasn't assuming too much, but I guessed you might prefer this to an expensive gift.In honor of your birthday, please allow me to perform a fan dance for you."
Kamisato Ayaka,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Thank you very much. It has been richly rewarding to learn from you so far, and I believe my skills with the blade can go even further still."
Kamisato Ayaka,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Thank you for your guidance. With your assistance, I am gaining a more thorough understanding of my capabilities."
Kamisato Ayaka,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,I feel more competent now than ever before. I even have the time outside my work for the Yashiro Commission to try some new things. Would you like to try one of my home-made snacks? I just learned how to make them recently.
Kamisato Ayaka,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"""Though I cling to that which has given me the strength to hold on, the weight of letting go is ever-foreboding.""My apologies, it should be a happy occasion, and yet it is such a sad phrase that comes to mind. Our time together has been so pleasant that I am fearful of losing what I have gained. I'm sorry, I must compose myself."
Kamisato Ayato,Hello,"Greetings. Ayaka has mentioned you on numerous occasions — alas, my schedule has been rather busier than anticipated recently, which belated our first meeting until today. Kamisato Ayato, head of the Kamisato Clan. Delighted to make your acquaintance."
Kamisato Ayato,Chat: Spoiled,"I'm sure I've forgotten something... Not to worry, I'll simply send someone to fetch it. As soon as I remember what it was."
Kamisato Ayato,Chat: Reel Them In,"Everything's in place, and they've taken the bait... Yes. Now to start reeling them in..."
Kamisato Ayato,Chat: Perverse Pleasure,"I have to stifle a smile every time I remember the look on my retainers' faces when I informed them of my plans today... Panic-stricken, but unable to muster the courage to say anything in opposition, hehe. Yes, this was a fine idea."
Kamisato Ayato,When It Rains,"Let's take shelter for the time being. Don't worry, one of my people will be here with umbrellas momentarily."
Kamisato Ayato,When Thunder Strikes Friendship Lv. 4,"Ayaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying."
Kamisato Ayato,When It Snows,This view reminds me of another time it snowed... that was a long time ago.
Kamisato Ayato,When the Sun Is Out,Opportunities to bask in the sunlight like this are few and far between.
Kamisato Ayato,When It's Windy,"Sometimes, what appears at first to be nothing but a passing breeze can ultimately be that which alters the course of events... Hehe."
Kamisato Ayato,When the Wind Is Blowing,Most people hunker down against a strong headwind. Only a few people know how to utilize it to their advantage.
Kamisato Ayato,Good Morning,Good morning. A little sword practice while the day is young is good for the body and mind. I tend to avoid having anything scheduled during these hours... What do you say? Fancy crossing blades with me?
Kamisato Ayato,Good Afternoon,"If there's anything in particular you'd like for lunch, just let one of my staff know in advance. As my honored guest, I'm sure they will do their utmost to accommodate you."
Kamisato Ayato,Good Evening Friendship Lv. 4,"Given the hour of your call, perhaps you might stay for dinner?"
Kamisato Ayato,Good Night,"Ready to retire for the night, are we? Yes, go on then, you are excused. I'm not tired yet, so... Oh, it's you? Um, I have a few final things to attend to. You should go and get some sleep."
Kamisato Ayato,About Kamisato Ayato: Price to Pay,"Everything comes at a cost. And if you aspire to things that most could never dream of, then naturally, there will be an unimaginable price to pay."
Kamisato Ayato,About Kamisato Ayato: Methodology Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm no stickler for doing things in a certain way. Whatever method you use, the important thing is that it delivers acceptable results."
Kamisato Ayato,About Us: Most Entertaining Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Hehe, I heard about the little job you pulled at the Tenryou Commission. Most entertaining... It takes a special kind of person to get old man Kujou riled up enough to start tearing his hair out. Ahh... Oh, to have been a fly on the wall."
Kamisato Ayato,About Us: Trust Friendship Lv. 6,"Trusting another person isn't easy, especially for someone of high status. Place your trust in the wrong person, and it can quite literally cost you your life. But you have placed your trust in me, and of course I will not let you down."
Kamisato Ayato,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"A Vision is an eminently useful tool, so it only makes sense to put it to good use. Also, I like to think it's happiest in my possession because it has the chance to shine away in all its glory."
Kamisato Ayato,Something to Share,"If you throw fallen flowers onto the stove, the searing heat infuses them with one final spark of vitality, and for a brief moment, they radiate a more glorious glow than the flames themselves... it was a short life they lived, but it was by no means a wasted one."
Kamisato Ayato,Interesting Things,"When it comes to pets... Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say — I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality."
Kamisato Ayato,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4,"I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended."
Kamisato Ayato,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4,"There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them."
Kamisato Ayato,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"She looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance. Of course, you'd know far more about that than me, wouldn't you?"
Kamisato Ayato,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her. She is around the same age as Ayaka, and the two get along very well. I trust her direct and outspoken disposition won't lead Ayaka astray. Ayaka has always been staunchly true to herself, ever since she was a young child."
Kamisato Ayato,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"The cost of pursuing eternity has been great for the Almighty Shogun... and for all of Inazuma. These wounds will take time to heal, and as someone with a mediating role to play in the political process, I will be sure to fulfill that which is required of me."
Kamisato Ayato,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Lady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... ""the Yashiro rascal"" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas."
Kamisato Ayato,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Old man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation."
Kamisato Ayato,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4,"Once upon a time, the Kaedehara Clan was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities..."
Kamisato Ayato,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"Now he's an interesting case. The idea of pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle, I mean really... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me ""bro""... To this day, he calls me ""my bro Ayato"" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... eccentricities."
Kamisato Ayato,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"I have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the Tianquan operates. On the subject, I also happen to have a limited-edition copy of Liyue Millennial, if you're interested? What do you say, shall I have someone fetch it, so we can play a game?"
Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: I,"You want to know about me? Hmm. Things aren't always a case of the more you know, the better. Plenty of proverbs to corroborate that, as I'm sure you're aware. (Smile) Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time."
Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Strange tastes, you say...? You seem to misunderstand me. Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange? I would have thought you tease your little friend here on a regular basis for precisely that purpose, no?"
Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: III Friendship Lv. 4,"The Tri-Commission may appear calm and well-run, but I can assure you it is quite tumultuous beneath the placid surface. There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan. Neither in the past, when I was working to bring stability to our clan, nor here in the present, where I am working for the sake of all of Inazuma."
Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"You want to know about the Shuumatsuban? I suppose there's no harm in divulging a detail or two to you. It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry."
Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Do I have other tricks up my sleeve beyond the Shuumatsuban? Well, naturally. If even the cunning bunny burrows thrice, then what of the cunning human? But anyway, I've shared enough of my secrets. I think it's time I heard your story. Oh, and... you can spare the part about traveling in Teyvat. Tell me about before that."
Kamisato Ayato,Kamisato Ayato's Hobbies,"Hobbies... I had one or two as a child, but these days most of my time is taken up by my official duties, so they don't count... Hmm? Some people treat work as a hobby, you say? Goodness me. How very... exceptional."
Kamisato Ayato,Kamisato Ayato's Troubles,"Troubles? Whenever something's troubling me, it must be dealt with swiftly and comprehensively. And whenever someone is troubling me... Hehe..."
Kamisato Ayato,Favorite Food: Personal Preference,"Variety is the spice of life. In that sense, the Milk Tea Medley they started serving over in Hanamizaka recently isn't half bad. You should try it sometime. Other than that... I don't have any particular preferences when it comes to the food I eat on a daily basis. I have dedicated staff to arrange my daily meal plan, and whatever they serve, I eat."
Kamisato Ayato,Favorite Food: Trying New Things Friendship Lv. 6,"You couldn't perchance tell me your own tastes, could you? ...Ah, I see. Okay, I've made a note of that. Now I know what to say the next time I get asked about it."
Kamisato Ayato,Least Favorite Food,"Hmm... it looks like I mixed up my salt and my sugar. Savory Mizu Manjuu. Yes, this can work. I'll give them to Thoma."
Kamisato Ayato,Receiving a Gift: I,"Very novel indeed. Haha, it meets my requirements perfectly..."
Kamisato Ayato,Receiving a Gift: II,I see. So this is your take on this dish...
Kamisato Ayato,Receiving a Gift: III,Here's a suggestion: Try using this dish in the hot pot game next time you play.
Kamisato Ayato,Birthday,"Happy Birthday! Now, how would you like to be Yashiro Commissioner for a day, hmm? All the work has been handled already, so you can focus on simply enjoying the feeling of having an enormous amount of executive power at your fingertips. Don't worry, the retainers won't dare question it, I'll be with you the entire time, hehe."
Kamisato Ayato,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Did I just grow more competent? Goodness, how marvelous..."
Kamisato Ayato,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"At the end of the day, power is only a source of comfort when it is concentrated in one's own hands."
Kamisato Ayato,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Hehe, I'm sure certain people are starting to grow rather nervous right about now..."
Kamisato Ayato,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I've had very few chances to kick back and put my feet up since taking over leadership of the clan. But things have felt curiously different since having you around. Hmm... Yes, it feels rather like basking in the sun."
Keqing,Hello,"I am Keqing, Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing. We live in an era of change, as the old order that has existed for a thousand years is about to be rewritten. Join me. Let us bear witness to this historical moment together."
Keqing,Chat: Delays,Come on. Enough procrastinating. Let's go.
Keqing,Chat: Relax,"I'm all for work-life balance, but I think this is pushing it."
Keqing,Chat: Opportunity,"In adventuring, as in business, you always have to seize the opportunity while it's there."
Keqing,When It Rains,"Quite a downpour... Nothing will get done until it clears. Let this be a lesson to those who yesterday said, ""I'll do it tomorrow."
Keqing,When Thunder Strikes,"Thunder and lightning can be quite frightening, but don't worry — Liyue's storm and fire defenses are second to none."
Keqing,When It Snows,"Don't worry, snowfall on this scale is no impediment. We can keep moving."
Keqing,When the Sun Is Out,"Ah, the sun is out, our work's done for the day... Shall we take a stroll?"
Keqing,Good Morning,"Morning. Time to set the tone for the rest of the day, so if you're still feeling sleepy, shake it off!"
Keqing,Good Afternoon,"I'm not in the habit of napping at noon, but don't let that stop you if you're feeling tired. I'll give you a wake up call in, say, three minutes' time."
Keqing,Good Evening,The lights are coming on now that the night is setting in. Another delightful day draws to a close.
Keqing,Good Night,"Sleep well... me? Uh... I still have a handful of things on my to-do list, but I'll call it a night once they are done."
Keqing,About Keqing: Idealism,"If you feel strongly about something, you should speak up and take action. That's the philosophy I live by."
Keqing,About Keqing: Work,"My role is to manage real estate and construction in Liyue. Sure, Liyue is a vast place with abundant resources — but without proper planning, and if too much focus is placed on short-term profit, a great many things can go wrong."
Keqing,About Keqing: Skepticism,"What do you think has kept Liyue going over the last millennium? Rex Lapis? ...I disagree. We mortals have to fight for survival whatever happens, he just feels the need to come down here and poke his nose into everything that's going on for some reason... Hmph, people don't like to think about this, but should we really be trusting him to be an expert in everything?"
Keqing,About Keqing: Self-Reflection A New Star Approaches,"After I took on the management of so many of Liyue's affairs, I had a new-found respect for Rex Lapis and all his hard work over the last millennium. Recently, every time I come up against a difficult problem with no obvious solution, I find myself thinking: What would Rex Lapis do? Maybe he really IS an expert in everything, and I've got more left to learn than I realized..."
Keqing,About Us: Pursuing,"You know why I like you? It's because you don't believe something just because it was said by a god. You make up your own mind. You ask the questions everyone else is too cowardly to ask, and when you don't get an answer, you keep looking until you find one. Oh, don't worry — your way is definitely the right way. Who says gods don't make mistakes, anyway?"
Keqing,About Us: Trying Friendship Lv. 6,"It's not difficult, you'll see, just give it a try. What if you try and it doesn't work out? ...No, I don't believe that will happen. You've never let me down before, you don't seem the type."
Keqing,About Us: Encouragement Friendship Lv. 6 A New Star Approaches,"I used to be so naive. I genuinely believed that I was on a par with Rex Lapis... Seems I really overestimated myself. Hmm? Yes... You're right! I have plenty of self-confidence in other areas, so why not in this? ...I can catch up with him — I WILL catch up with him! I just need to keep my chin up, keep trying, and keep learning!"
Keqing,About the Vision: Skepticism Friendship Lv. 4,"If a Vision means the approval of the gods, then I don't see why I should want one. In fact, I find it quite insulting... It's like trying to say everything I've ever achieved is all thanks to the gods looking out for me! Well, I got to where I am today through hard work. The gods had nothing to do with it."
Keqing,About the Vision: Reflection Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Oh, so... Rex Lapis wanted me to have power beyond the average mortal so that I can be a great leader? Huh... I like to think I'd do an admirable job even without his blessing! Yeah, I'll show him... I won't give him any reason to be disappointed with me..."
Keqing,Something to Share: Initiative,"In addition to my work with the Liyue Qixing, I do a lot of work for the public, too. Mostly the feedback is positive, but whenever I propose something like adding an extra hour to the workday, I come up against very strong resistance... I'm too forward-thinking, I suppose. Maybe I should start with a half hour instead?"
Keqing,Something to Share: Souvenir A New Star Approaches,"What do you mean, Geo Archon paraphernalia? ...You're not suggesting my bedroom is full of that stuff, surely? I'm not a child anymore! Although... Okay I did buy a couple of Rex Lapis figurines recently, but — but, they're just to keep me on the straight and narrow. Look, just because I own an idol or two does not mean that I idolize him, okay!?"
Keqing,Interesting Things,"I once heard a Mondstadt fable about courage being what it takes for birds to learn to fly. But I think that you must first possess a yearning for the boundless skies before you would have any inclination, let alone the courage, to spread your wings and try to fly. For me, Liyue is that boundless sky."
Keqing,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"The gentleman from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? Clearly, he's an extremely learned individual, and I do have a lot of respect for him. But his mindset is too traditional for me — he thinks in the same tired old terms as Rex Lapis did.. If he were more of an original thinker, I'm sure he'd be a great asset to me in reaching my objectives."
Keqing,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"That captain is always flouting the rules, and her personality really rubs people the wrong way. That said, The Crux Fleet is indispensable to Liyue Harbor. It's a bit of an art, knowing when to enforce the rules and when it's in everyone's interests to be more lenient. Thing is, the Tianquan is supposed to be the one enforcing the rules, but she always seems to be too busy..."
Keqing,About Ningguang: Conflict Friendship Lv. 4,"We do work together, but we couldn't be more opposite personality-wise. To her, Liyue Harbor is nothing more than a marketplace, and she'll do anything as long as it makes money for her. Doesn't she have any principles? Hmm, or maybe turning a profit is her principle?"
Keqing,About Ningguang: Cooperation Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Since Rex Lapis left us, we've actually found some common ground. I was quite judgmental of her in the past, and we still fundamentally disagree on a number of issues, but in the current climate I have to say I count her as a comrade in arms."
Keqing,About Ningguang: Trifling Matters Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Ugh, having said that... I ordered a Lucent Crescent from Mingxing Jewellery three months in advance, and when it was finally time to pick it up, they told me Ningguang had bought up the last few months' worth of Lucent Crescents for herself by paying double the price! *sigh* She can be such a pain!"
Keqing,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,"You know what, I think her music rocks. Too noisy by traditional standards, for sure, but I don't care. Good music is good music. And good music should reach the widest possible audience."
Keqing,About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4,"Everyone has faith in Dr. Baizhu's medical skills. He's the right guy to go to when you can't figure out what's wrong with you. Oh... the rumors, you say? The only one I know for a fact is true is how disgusting his medicine tastes. It's not just the kids who find it bitter, it's left me with some horrible memories, too!"
Keqing,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"Yeah, the up-and-coming chef from Wanmin Restaurant... I get that she's gifted and everything, I just think her cooking can be a bit hit-or-miss. I was all ready to hire her for a small banquet once, and give her full control over the menu... but the amount of lizard and slime in her sample dishes quickly turned me off to that idea!"
Keqing,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"I've heard his story — he was born into a well-to-do family, but wasn't keen on the family business, so he now devotes his time to being an envoy of justice. I have huge respect for that! Not everyone has the guts to follow their dreams when it means breaking with a long-standing family tradition."
Keqing,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"I feel like now that we live in the age of mankind's rule, it's time for the legendary boy-adeptus to be released from duty. We no longer need a defender of that kind, because we are capable of working through the challenges we face on our own strength."
Keqing,About Ganyu: Skepticism Friendship Lv. 4,"Who knows what Rex Lapis must have done to inspire such blind devotion from Ganyu... But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages. In the workplace, she'll carry out my instructions to the letter, even when I can tell she has her reservations. It's a good attitude to have as a career professional."
Keqing,About Ganyu: Reflection Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"I find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh... I feel a bit awkward, though, because I used to be openly disparaging of Rex Lapis in front of her... But she doesn't seem to mind, so I guess I've got nothing to worry about..."
Keqing,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"When you're passing by Heyu Tea House and have to squeeze your way through the biggest crowd you've seen in your life, that's when you know Yun Jin's on stage performing. There's not a merchant in Liyue who wouldn't buy up the place if they had the chance, and Yun Jin is the reason it would be worth every Mora."
Keqing,About The Anemo Archon Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Since Rex Lapis left us, the question of Liyue's future has been on my mind constantly. In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too. Mondstadt's god is the one who baffles me the most though — how exactly do any of his actions contribute to the longevity of Mondstadt? It's completely beyond me."
Keqing,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4,"The way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past. However, it should also be continuously adapted and improved to match the needs of the present. Given that Liyue is about to undergo a radical transformation, legal talent is in great demand. With an assistant like Yanfei, I could spare myself a great deal of trouble."
Keqing,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"Ms. Yelan's ancestors used to serve the Qixing. My grandfather and her family have had academic collaborations in the past. All in all, she's reliable, efficient, and provides important intel to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I can't say for sure how Ms. Yelan actually gets her intel, however..."
Keqing,More About Keqing: I,"You want to know more about me? Sure. Let's start with the principles that are central to the role of Yuheng. Once you've memorized the hundred or more contractual obligations of the position, you'll know my hopes and dreams like the back of your hand!"
Keqing,More About Keqing: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Nothing exists independently, and there's nothing you can do to change that. So, when you drag your heels on one thing, you're actually causing chaos for a whole bunch of other connected issues, too. That's why I firmly believe you should never put off until tomorrow what you can do today... I'm also a very impatient person and can't stand procrastinating, so that's also a part of it."
Keqing,More About Keqing: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Never mince your words with me, okay? Yuheng's just a title. I'll not have you treading on eggshells around me just because of my status. Say what's on your mind, always — that's what makes you unique, and it's the thing I admire most about you."
Keqing,More About Keqing: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"We've been on our fair share of adventures together, haven't we? The more time we spend together, the more I think you're the person of my dreams, and— Huh? Why so shocked? You're a crucial part of my dreams for the new Liyue."
Keqing,More About Keqing: V Friendship Lv. 6 A New Star Approaches,"""The time has come for humanity to make its mark in the land of the Geo Archon..."" Turns out that was quite an ambitious statement after all. But I want you to make me a promise: come and visit when the new Liyue Harbor is born, I will show you around. After all the help and support you've given me along the way, you deserve to see Liyue reborn with your own eyes. I owe you that much."
Keqing,Keqing's Hobbies,"That indulgent feeling of being spoilt for choice between countless different varieties... That, to me, is the appeal of shopping."
Keqing,Keqing's Troubles,It's great that the quality of life in Liyue is improving for everyone. But one downside is the growing number of people who are happy to reap the rewards without doing their fair share of the work. The Liyue Qixing did not put in all this effort to create a more prosperous society just so people like them can loaf around.
Keqing,Favorite Food,"It makes no logical sense to be greedy with food, but for me, all rationality goes out the window when there's Golden Shrimp Balls involved... They're just irresistible. The taste of a single Golden Shrimp Ball brings me so much joy that all the stress of work just melts away."
Keqing,Least Favorite Food,"Everything has a certain way it should taste. I won't touch anything that tries to break the mold, so no salted Almond Tofu for me, and no sweetened Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup either. It's just a total waste of perfectly good ingredients."
Keqing,Receiving a Gift: I,"Yep, that's right. My favorite."
Keqing,Receiving a Gift: II,"The taste is fairly standard, but I can see you worked hard at it."
Keqing,Receiving a Gift: III,It seems quite a ways off from how it's supposed to taste...
Keqing,Birthday,"Happy Birthday! I've got a very special gift for you. It might look like an ordinary old lantern, but this one runs on Electro energy and stays alight for a really long time. For those times when you need a little extra light in your life."
Keqing,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"When your heart is set on something, you get closer to your goal with each passing day."
Keqing,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Great, having another trick up my sleeve gives me more flexibility in rapidly changing circumstances."
Keqing,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,Yesterday's experiences make me stronger today. And most of those experiences are ones that I share with you.
Keqing,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I feel I have grown immensely from my travels with you. If, one day, I finally manage to make my dreams a reality... I wonder, will you still be there by my side?"
Klee,Hello,"Spark Knight Klee of the Knights of Favonius, reporting for duty! ...There's some more, but uh, I forgot. I'm not so good at remembering..."
Klee,Chat: Spoils,Klee was a brave girl today! I found a really weird-looking lizard! Want me to show it to you?
Klee,Chat: Adventures,"Do you wanna come fish blasting with me? I'll get grounded for a whole day, but it's way worth it coz the fish taste sooo goood!"
Klee,Chat: Rules,"""Explosion inside city wall, grounded be thy woe,"" ""Explosions can hurt people, Jean can be dreadful,"" ""Mondstadt be bombed, Klee be doomed."" Those're the survival rules that the Knights of Favonius gave me."
Klee,When It Rains,"Mwauhahaha, lucky all my new bombs are waterproof!"
Klee,When Thunder Strikes,"What'd I blow up!? ...Oh wait, it's just thunder and lightning. Phew."
Klee,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Dear Anemo God, please make Klee's bombs blow in the right direction and only blow up bad guys. The end."
Klee,Good Morning,Good morning! Can I come play with you today? Pleeeease? I wanna go on an adventure!
Klee,Good Afternoon,Lunchtime! What do you wanna eat today? Let me see if the Teyvat Travel Guide has any suggestions...
Klee,Good Evening,Good evening! Can you please tell Huffman that Klee is not a baby and is definitely allowed out to play at night? Please take me out to play together!
Klee,Good Night,"Hey... Um... I know I said I don't wanna go home and all, but now it's nighttime and I can't find my way home in the dark...Can you please take me home on your way back? Pleeeease?"
Klee,About Klee: Incidents,Ohhhhh... I broke one of the blades on the windmill - I'm really sorry!
Klee,About Klee: Reparations,I'm really good at fixing things though. I can help! Huh? What do you mean that's child labor? What even is child labor? Does that mean I can't help?
Klee,About Us: Knights For a Tomorrow Without Tears,"Hee-hee, you're an Honorary Knight but I've been a Spark Knight longer... That means I'm higher up than you, right? So you have to do what I say! So, um... Ca-Can you not say anything about the big disaster I caused? It was an accident..."
Klee,About Us: Playmates Friendship Lv. 6,"No! It's only nine o'clock, I'm staying up to watch the circus' special midnight performance! You're supposed to be my best friend! Don't even think about trying to send me home!"
Klee,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"This little marble is supposed to be a present from Barbatos to say well done? Well done for what though? ...Hmm, he is the god of freedom I guess, maybe that's why he likes me? Alright, from now on I'll say thank you to Barbatos by showing that I have the freedom to blow up as many fish as I want! ...Am I doing it right?"
Klee,Something to Share,"At the Knights of Favonius building, you're not allowed to blow up the walls. Shame, it would make getting out of solitary confinement way easier... but if I did so much as try to blow up the wall, Jean would make sure Klee never sees the light of day again. That's what Jean said, Kaeya told me."
Klee,Interesting Things,"Every lizard has a different pattern on his back, and some of them you can use their dried-out tails to make gunpowder with. I know because Albedo told me so."
Klee,About Razor Friendship Lv. 4,"Razor's one of my best buddies! Whenever a disaster happens, he always knows the best way to fix it and helps keep Klee safe. Um, but most of the time I'm the one who caused the disaster..."
Klee,About the Parents Friendship Lv. 4,"My mom and dad are the famousest travelers in Teyvat! Mom writes the Teyvat Travel Guide, so all the restaurants and hotels in the whole world care what she thinks about them."
Klee,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,Kaeya is the best! He wrote the Favonius Survival Rulebook for me and he always helps me cover it up when I make a big disaster.
Klee,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,Amber is the best! Baron Bunny is so fluffy and he even explodes! So. Cool.
Klee,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,Master Jean is the best! But she's also a little bit scary.
Klee,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,He's one of the weird grown-ups. He's so grumpy all the time... Why does he never smile?
Klee,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"Lisa is the best! She always sneaks me some treats when I visit her at the workshop. ...Huh, I just remembered I was gonna ask her if I could use the workshop to make some new gunpowder. But I totally forgot..."
Klee,About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4,"Bennett is the best! I always find way more treasure if I go adventuring with Bennett! ...But he never finds any. Why is that, anyway?"
Klee,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,"Diona is the best! I like listening to her, last time I heard her say, ""I'm gonna destroy the wine industry in this city if it's the last thing I do!"" And I'm gonna help her using my bombs! ...I don't know what a wine industry is though. Is it a monster?"
Klee,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Me and Albedo have a secret code! Whenever he puts a sign on his workshop door saying ""Experiment in Progress,"" that's code for ""Come back later, Klee."" Albedo's really nice and he's so patient with me, so I don't mind waiting until he's finished with his work."
Klee,About Mona Friendship Lv. 4,"Mona is the best! It's so much fun when she comes to play with me and Albedo. She talks about all these amazing things, and I don't understand most of it but... Ah, I just love it when Mona comes round!"
Klee,About Sucrose Friendship Lv. 4,"Sucrose is the best! This one time she asked me if I wanted a Jumpy Dumpty that can run as well as jump. Tee-hee, well duh! Of course I do, I want hundreds of them! I wanna put them on every street, every staircase, and every square in Mondstadt!"
Klee,More About Klee: I,"Hello, are you here for playtime with Klee?"
Klee,More About Klee: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Yeah! This is my new and improved bomb! Whaddya think? Great huh? ...Oh, but ahh... If you find it near any fires, it's not mine. Definitely. Not. Mine."
Klee,More About Klee: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas... But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place."
Klee,More About Klee: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"This is Dodoco, my oldest and bestest friend! Okay, now I've introduced you, don't forget her name again alright? No more calling Dodoco (puts on silly voice) ""that silly doll Klee always hangs on her rucksack."
Klee,More About Klee: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Thanks for helping me out every time I get in trouble! I have a thank-you present for you — barbecued fish, made with my own secret recipe! ...Okay, so the secret recipe is exploding the fish out of the water. Tee-hee, they're fully cooked by the time they land! But it's a secret, right, so you don't get to tell anybody. Just pretend like you don't even know."
Klee,Klee's Hobbies,I like things that are fluffy~! Like Dodoco! And dandelions! And Razor's hair!
Klee,Klee's Troubles,"*sigh* You're a good person, but I'm a bad girl. Once I'm out of solitary confinement and am done reflecting on my actions, we can go play together again, okay?"
Klee,Favorite Food,"Mondstadt's basses are delicious, especially the ones you grab yourself from Cider Lake! I'm not even kidding, even my mom thinks so."
Klee,Least Favorite Food,"I hate, hate, hate Mondstadt's crabs! All of them! I wanna go out and play, I don't wanna just sit there tryna de-shell a crab all day..."
Klee,Receiving a Gift: I,"Yummy, yummy! Oof, I'm so full..."
Klee,Receiving a Gift: II,"Yay, I got to eat something tasty today. I'm so happy! Thank you!"
Klee,Receiving a Gift: III,"It looks yummy, but it's kinda hard work to eat... Hee-hee, how about you help me? Pretty please!"
Klee,Birthday,"♪Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear traveler, happy birthday to you!♪ You're older than me right? That means you've had way more birthdays than me... I'm sooo jealous!"
Klee,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Mm, new-bomb research complete! Now, let's get outta here before Jean finds out..."
Klee,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Aw yeah, I improved again! But as Jean says, ""Continuous self-improvement is one's duty."" She says that means I'm allowed to be a bit happy about it, but not the most happy I've ever been in my whole life about it."
Klee,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Thanks for helping me gather so much stuff for my research! If you ever wanna learn how to make a bomb, I can teach you y'know."
Klee,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I remember the first time I ever heard an explosion... I wasn't scared at all. Later on, I found out that apparently, that's not ""normal"", and most people would've been scared. But hey, you're not scared of my bombs right? Tee-hee, I knew it! That's why you're my bestest friend ever!"
Kujou Sara,Hello,"I am Kujou Sara. You may forget my name, but this you must know: On my watch, Inazuma will always be defended, and the will of the Shogun will always be done. Deity or demon, if you make an enemy of me you will be struck down! Oh, ahem... Don't be so nervous. I have agreed to fight by your side, and I will honor that commitment. I may be uncompromising on matters of great importance, but on most other things, you will find me quite easygoing."
Kujou Sara,Chat: Target,"To strike your foe takes unity between mind, arrow, and bow."
Kujou Sara,Chat: Eternity,To manifest Eternity per the Almighty Shogun's will — that is what I aspire to.
Kujou Sara,Chat: Duty,"The duty of a tengu warrior is to watch over the mountains and forests, while that of the Kujou Clan is to guard Inazuma. These two are of the same ilk."
Kujou Sara,When It Rains,The sound of rain masks the enemy's footsteps. Stay alert.
Kujou Sara,When Thunder Strikes,Listen. Thunder speaks the will of the Almighty Shogun.
Kujou Sara,When It Snows,"I would like to catch a snowflake, but once you have them in the palm of your hand, they melt away all the more quickly."
Kujou Sara,When the Sun Is Out,The skies are clear and the sun is bright. Fine weather for a showdown.
Kujou Sara,Good Morning,Good morning...? You mean you only just got out of bed? This is already quite late by my standards. I typically rise well before daybreak.
Kujou Sara,Good Afternoon,"I am not in the habit of resting at noon. But if you wish to do so, I will wait for you."
Kujou Sara,Good Evening,"Good evening. You know, in Hanamizaka, the sight of the Sakura by night is quite splendid. I never tire of it."
Kujou Sara,Good Night,Go and rest. I will stay here and keep watch.
Kujou Sara,About Kujou Sara: Tenryou Commission,"I am grateful to Takayuki. The Tenryou Commission is all I've ever had to rely on, and I will do everything within my power to defend my family's honor. Hmm? You want to know about the Tenryou Commission's code of conduct? Loyalty to the Raiden Shogun, of course! That is also my life's creed."
Kujou Sara,About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War Friendship Lv. 4,"Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10. The other nine times, I would already be fighting fiercely on the front line. Not because I am foolhardy, nor because I lack courtesy, but because the battle never waits till you are ready."
Kujou Sara,About Kujou Sara: Aspiration Friendship Lv. 6,My aspirations? I thought you already knew: To assist the Almighty Shogun in manifesting Eternity. That is what I aspire to. Hmm? Personal aspirations? It's not something I have ever thought about before...
Kujou Sara,About Us: Observation,"Though you present an unstable factor in the Almighty Shogun's Eternity, unstable does not have to mean a threat. So I am not your enemy — but I will be watching you at all times."
Kujou Sara,About Us: Experiences Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"When I confiscated people's Visions, I trampled on their ambitions. Now that the Vision Hunt Decree has been repealed, I must atone for my actions. I am led to believe that you can hear those ambitions...The ones echoing within the Visions embedded on the Statue of the Omnipresent God? I'd like you to tell me more about them. Also... your own ambitions, I would like to hear about those as well."
Kujou Sara,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Only if the gods cast their gaze upon you will you receive a Vision. Since my own Vision was granted by the Almighty Shogun, I shall return it to her in the end, without hesitation and with no regrets."
Kujou Sara,Something to Share: Spinning Top,"During a previous assignment, a vendor in Hanamizaka gifted me a kind of spinning top called the ""Solo."" It's a toy that you can play with when you're by yourself. I was quite taken with it, so I kept it. ...You want to play with it together? But that would defy the principle on which the Solo is based... Respectfully, I must decline."
Kujou Sara,Something to Share: Local Specialty,"Do you know what the most distinctively Inazuman item of all is? No, it is not a blade of any sort. It is a lacquerware carving of the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder. They are hand-made by old and skilled lacquerware craftspeople, and nearly every single home in the city has one. My house, you ask? I have five."
Kujou Sara,Interesting Things,"Whenever something is bothering me inside, I stand beneath the Sacred Sakura, close my eyes, and try to calm my mind. When I open my eyes again, the falling blossoms will guide my path."
Kujou Sara,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"The Tenryou Commission's estate is very large. It would serve us well to have a fine housekeeper like Thoma who could keep all the numerous and disparate household affairs in order. If he ever tires of working for the Kamisato Clan, I would very much like for him to come to us... though I doubt that day will ever come."
Kujou Sara,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4,"In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter... I have heard that Miss Kamisato is skilled in the game of Go, and have always hoped for an occasion to pay her a visit, but... I also worry that someone of a serious demeanor like myself may not quite fit in there."
Kujou Sara,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma."
Kujou Sara,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him. He seems preoccupied with his personal schemes while official duties take second place. The only reason I have not sought to bring him into line so far is that his investigations deliver results...*sigh* He is such a headache."
Kujou Sara,About the Raiden Shogun: Trust Friendship Lv. 4,"As I'm sure you've heard many times before, the Almighty Shogun seeks Eternity — an existence beyond the dominion of thought and longing. ""Abandon mortal ties, strive for an unchanging Eternity""... The Almighty Shogun's manner is always resolute, and I do not always fully grasp the meaning of her words. But this is her decision, and I trust her."
Kujou Sara,About the Raiden Shogun: Service Friendship Lv. 6,"So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route. I do not know whether the Shogun has finally found inner peace after protecting Inazuma over all these millennia. All I know is that however perilous the road ahead may become, I will follow her as I have always done."
Kujou Sara,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her. But... if there ever comes a day when she disobeys the Shogun's will, then please accept my apologies in advance."
Kujou Sara,About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4,"She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of. I wonder if I should adopt this technique for commanding the Shogun's Army? Hmm... but this could lead us to a situation whereby war is waged at the negotiation table, each side with their pack of strategy cards, playing them one by one until a victor emerges... Then again, perhaps not."
Kujou Sara,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,"Gorou is to Sangonomiya Kokomi as I am to the Raiden Shogun. He is fiercely loyal, and I have great respect for this. It's a shame we're on opposing sides, so we'll never get to work together... Still, I am glad to have an admirable foe. Also... I hear he's a fifth-born son. That just makes it even better."
Kujou Sara,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered. He showed he was enough of a man to admit defeat, but the rematch he insisted upon... Tsk... To this day, I still don't want to talk about it. If you really must know, you can go and ask him yourself."
Kujou Sara,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang. I must concede, however, that at the very least, her presence has effectively prevented idlers from stirring up trouble and disturbing the public, reducing the burden on the Tenryou Commission."
Kujou Sara,More About Kujou Sara: I,"You want to know more about me? ...Know what, exactly? I can't discuss Tenryou Commission business with you, that's strictly confidential, and I certainly can't divulge anything relating to the Almighty Shogun. What exactly are you trying to achieve? Hmm? Me on a personal level...? I suppose that's not out of the question, just... unprecedented."
Kujou Sara,"More About Kujou Sara: II Friendship Lv. 3 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot. Then I go to the courtyard where I take five deep breaths before walking five laps around it. For breakfast, I typically eat five mouthfuls... Five is my lucky number, so I do things in fives. Do you have some objection to that?"
Kujou Sara,"More About Kujou Sara: III Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained. The will of the Almighty Shogun must be executed, but I do not condone violence against innocent people! I have expressly forbidden such behavior on countless occasions but judging by the outcome, it seems difficult to root out. If you have any ideas on how to tackle it, please share them with me."
Kujou Sara,"More About Kujou Sara: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","Although I was fully adopted by the Kujou Clan, I know that Takayuki does not look at me the same way he looks at Kamaji. I might be a little stone-faced sometimes, but even I get lonely... especially when I catch sight of one of my subordinates sharing an intimate moment with their family. ...I'm sorry, I have nothing but gratitude for Takayuki. How could I be so disrespectful..."
Kujou Sara,"More About Kujou Sara: V Friendship Lv. 6 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","Now that I think about it, you and I are a good example of achieving concord through conflict. We were on opposite sides — diametrically opposed, you could say. I never imagined I would end up alongside you, either in battle or in long conversation... Fate has been kind to me, no, sorry, ignore that."
Kujou Sara,Kujou Sara's Hobbies,"To this day, not a day goes by without bow exercises and target practice. From adopting the stance, to aiming, to hearing the twang of the bowstring, none of this is dry and repetitive for me — it is about transcending the me of yesterday! I wouldn't call it a hobby so much as a lifelong discipline."
Kujou Sara,Kujou Sara's Troubles,"The existence of a tengu warrior's wings is an objective fact, as is the reality that they will take up a certain amount of space when standing side-by-side. So when you say ""come closer,"" I fail to see how exactly I am supposed to achieve that."
Kujou Sara,Favorite Food,"I have always had a preference for easy-to-carry foods that provide quick and ample sustenance, such as Onigiri. The top choice for replenishing your stamina in the middle of a battle! But that's just a personal preference. I don't dictate what my subordinates have to eat."
Kujou Sara,Least Favorite Food,"I generally avoid sweet foods, not that I have a strong aversion to them. Why? Well, sweet things put your mind and body at rest, so if I ever eat sweet things it's easy to... Ahem, essentially, I mustn't slack off and that's the end of it. No further questions on this topic!"
Kujou Sara,Receiving a Gift: I,"So, there is a dish that tastes even better than Onigiri? Then I shall be sure to remember its name."
Kujou Sara,Receiving a Gift: II,I have eaten my fill. Thank you for your hospitality.
Kujou Sara,Receiving a Gift: III,No need for dessert...
Kujou Sara,Birthday,"Excellent timing. I will dispense with the formalities and get straight to the point — do you have a birthday wish? Providing that it does not conflict with the Almighty Shogun's grand cause, I will make every effort to see it come to fruition. To show that I am being completely serious, I will allow you to make not one, but five birthday wishes."
Kujou Sara,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,My bow sounds in peak condition. One shot is all I need.
Kujou Sara,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,Power duly assimilated. Ready to receive instruction.
Kujou Sara,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,The Shogun's Army might as well just be me!
Kujou Sara,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"The responsibility for honing my strength and advancing my martial abilities lies with me, and yet you have so diligently and willingly helped me... I will become worthy of this power by harnessing it for a higher cause! Also... the favor of the tengu will always be with you!"
Kuki Shinobu,Hello,"Oh... Hey there! I'm Kuki Shinobu, deputy leader of the Arataki Gang. We offer a wide range of services, including but not limited to transport and logistics, security, home repair, and musical performances. Please feel free to contact me if you need anything. Here's my card."
Kuki Shinobu,Chat: In a Pinch,Just let me know if you ever find yourself in a pinch. I can help you out.
Kuki Shinobu,Chat: Certificates,"The criteria for certificate exams are straightforward enough, what it really comes down to is whether you are willing to put in the time. If you study and practice, then it's really not all that difficult."
Kuki Shinobu,Chat: The Arataki Gang,"If the Arataki Gang stirs up any trouble, I'll drag every last one of them back to apologize."
Kuki Shinobu,When It Rains,"We don't need an umbrella, just pick up the pace."
Kuki Shinobu,When Thunder Strikes,Be careful. No one wants to get struck by lightning.
Kuki Shinobu,When It Snows,Let's just finish the job and leave. There's no need to waste time.
Kuki Shinobu,When the Sun Is Out,"It's a nice day, but I can't seem to shake this strange feeling... Huh, let's just hope it's my imagination."
Kuki Shinobu,When the Wind Is Blowing,Hmm... what a pleasant breeze.
Kuki Shinobu,Good Morning,"Morning. Going out to train? Huh, I didn't know you were so diligent."
Kuki Shinobu,Good Afternoon,"Hey, what would you like to eat? I've been saving up lately, so lunch is on me."
Kuki Shinobu,Good Evening,"Some commissions are better done by night. I can't trust the gang with such tasks though, so I usually do them myself."
Kuki Shinobu,Good Night,Go ahead and take a rest if you need. Don't worry about me.
Kuki Shinobu,About Kuki Shinobu: Gang's Deputy Leader,"My primary responsibilities are to bring in business and maintain a stable team... uh, as well as bailing out the gang from the Police Station, returning snacks and toys to kids, and catching anyone secretly slacking off during a job... I guess you could say all this extra work comes with being part of the Arataki Gang. I suppose that leaders of other groups wouldn't have to put up with that kind of stuff. But then again, no one else could do the job like me."
Kuki Shinobu,About Kuki Shinobu: Backup Plan Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm? What would happen if the gang ever disbanded? First of all, that would never happen. Secondly, even if that did happen, I've got nothing to worry about. I've always got a way to make ends meet."
Kuki Shinobu,About Us: Notes,"Come find me if you ever suddenly want to become certified in anything. I'll lend you all my notes for the exam. Believe me, my notes are detailed enough to help anybody pass."
Kuki Shinobu,About Us: Cleaning Up the Mess Friendship Lv. 6,"Whether you are in the Arataki Gang or not, I'll never treat you as an outsider. Just go ahead and leave the logistics and planning to me. Trust me, I'm an expert. I can handle anything, no matter how complicated it might seem. Huh? You're concerned about my safety? Hehe, don't worry, all these years of experience aren't just for show."
Kuki Shinobu,About the Vision,"Just like a certificate, this Vision is solid proof of my capabilities. The only difference is that I'm still not certain about a Vision's assessment criteria."
Kuki Shinobu,Something to Share: Face Mask,"I wear a mask because I don't want to be recognized by anybody, especially when I'm working with the Arataki Gang. If someone I know manages to recognize me, they're sure to make a big fuss about it... It gives me a headache just thinking about it. I won't ever let it happen again! Ahem, never mind..."
Kuki Shinobu,Something to Share: Gang Bylaws Friendship Lv. 4,I came up with the Gang Bylaws so everyone would have a set of guidelines to follow. Huh? Why are they willing to follow my rules? Because both my words and my fists are very persuasive.
Kuki Shinobu,Interesting Things,"There is a saying circulating among the shrines claiming that if you weave Naku Weed into a ring and wrap it around your body, it can dispel disaster and bring good fortune. So, do you believe that? I, however, personally find the plant's paralyzing effect a little more practical."
Kuki Shinobu,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Transient Dreams,"After the Sakoku Decree was lifted, the Raiden Shogun issued many decrees aimed at supporting the development of various industries. All those certificates I received during the Sakoku Decree are coming in real handy now, and the gang is finally out of the red... Fate really does have its ways. Who would've thought after all that, I'd still have her to thank?"
Kuki Shinobu,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Madam Kujou? Yes, she's a friend of mine. Hmm? You're surprised that I know her? Oh, you must've misunderstood, I knew her from before I joined the Arataki Gang. Heh, in fact, it's hard to tell who's the winner whenever we spar."
Kuki Shinobu,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,You can't imagine how boring it is to be a shrine maiden. Even Lady Guuji from the Grand Narukami Shrine has her publishing gig to break up the monotony. I will never go back to being a shrine maiden. Never.
Kuki Shinobu,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"The boss has a lot of unpleasant memories from his past, but he still manages to stay positive. I'd say that kind of resilience is pretty rare. He treats us well and his character has a good effect on everyone in the gang. Of course, it's never an excuse for him to run amok with no consideration for others. Just let me know if he ever causes you any trouble and I'll be sure to make him regret ever being rude to you."
Kuki Shinobu,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4,"Back then I had an argument with my family and I only wanted to run away as far as I could. So, I went to study law in Liyue, but thanks to this experience, I got to meet Yanfei. She's like a walking law encyclopedia. Huh? Me? I have a certificate but there are a lot of restrictions for practicing law... It's not really the right field for me."
Kuki Shinobu,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"He's different from the other Doushin of the Tenryou Commission. I have yet to see him on patrol or apprehend anyone, and he occasionally comes to me to buy intelligence. In exchange, I asked him to put in a good word for me whenever I'm bailing people out of the Police Station. He gladly agreed. I'd say that's a pretty good deal... After all, getting the boys to keep their eyes and ears open on the streets is easy enough."
Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: I,"I've worked many different jobs and I'm certified in a variety of fields. In terms of management, I've led a small team and have been responsible for delegating tasks and allocating resources according to... Uh, sorry, don't mind me... Sometimes I still slip into interview mode."
Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I come from a family of shrine maidens but I'm not cut out for that kind of work at all. When I ran away from home, I immediately thought I should learn as much as possible to support myself. I studied everything from cooking, tailoring, and fighting, to legal consulting, publishing, and editing... It wasn't until I really settled into society that I realized I've learned everything I need."
Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm? You think I've got good social skills? Well, you could say I've seen a lot of the world by now. I've learned how to read people based on their expressions and body language. Besides, nine times out of ten, it's the gang getting in trouble. I don't mind putting on a face to get us out of a sticky predicament, but I still prefer not to smile."
Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"When I first joined the Arataki Gang, the boss told me to teach the others how to fight. So the first thing I did was beat them up, one by one. I was a little surprised that even in their bruised and swollen state they still respectfully called me Shinobu and asked me to lead them. Hmph, at that moment, I knew they really were a big bunch of idiots... But that's fine, even a group like this won't slow me down, I'll just take care of everything myself."
Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: V Friendship Lv. 6,"It's my own decision to stay in the Arataki Gang. It can be pretty annoying having to clean up their mess all the time, but in return, they treat me with a sincerity that is irreplaceable... They always save the best things for me and never leave me feeling down. When I announced my decision to stay in the gang, they all cheered for me. I know outsiders don't think very highly of the Arataki Gang, and the members themselves don't really care what others think. But, I still want to strive to change the impression we leave. I might complain about them from time to time as my family, but I'll never let anyone badmouth them."
Kuki Shinobu,Kuki Shinobu's Hobbies,"Being in the gang means having lots of free time. I often finish reading a whole book or even pass a certificate exam before I even realize it. Kinda nice, wouldn't you agree? When my family asks about me, at least I can tell them I don't waste my time, and when I go job hunting, I have lots of qualifications to rely on. In this ultra-competitive society, a misfit like myself with all these certificates will never go hungry."
Kuki Shinobu,Kuki Shinobu's Troubles,"Back then, I wanted to avoid getting dragged back to the shrine at all cost, so I had to find a way to stand on my own two feet. So far, I think I'm doing alright."
Kuki Shinobu,Favorite Food,"Even after eating something really filling like ramen or gyoza, I still always want to finish my meal with a small bowl of rice. Rice is just delicious, that's all. Is there a problem with that?"
Kuki Shinobu,Least Favorite Food,"There's a saying I heard in Liyue: ""There is no bad food, only bad cooks."" After getting my license as a chef, I became even more convinced that this is absolutely true."
Kuki Shinobu,Receiving a Gift: I,This is truly exceptional. Ehem... I'll just have another bite.
Kuki Shinobu,Receiving a Gift: II,Did you make this? Hmm... you're more than qualified to be a chef.
Kuki Shinobu,Receiving a Gift: III,"Honestly, did you use the wrong seasonings?"
Kuki Shinobu,Birthday,"Happy birthday! Here, take this special dart made from Naku Weed. Be careful, yep, that's the way to hold it... Make sure you predict the trajectory before you throw it... Hehe, I'm happy that you like it. Oh, don't treat it like a toy, it's still quite dangerous. If you want to practice a little more, I can teach you."
Kuki Shinobu,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"If you haven't mastered the basics, then there's no point in even trying to discuss it. That's the purpose of a basic-level certificate, to show you actually know something."
Kuki Shinobu,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"I have an intermediate certificate, which means that I'm qualified to handle most problems. Is there anything I can help you with?"
Kuki Shinobu,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Earning an advanced certificate is not easy, it requires both talent and actual combat experience."
Kuki Shinobu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Certificates are useful for judging professional skills but they fail to measure the amount of effort or emotional investment involved. Our friendship has gone beyond something that can be expressed with a simple ""thank you."" Let me express my feelings by always giving the very best of my abilities."
Lisa,Hello,"Hi darling, are you going to be Lisa's little helper? What? Me, a grand mage? That was a long time ago, I'm just a humble librarian now. *chuckles* Don't worry darling, I'll take very good care of you. So..."
Lisa,Chat: Afternoon Tea,It's nearly time for afternoon tea.
Lisa,Chat: Quest,Why not keep me company for a while... There'll be plenty of time for work later.
Lisa,Chat: Better to Stay In,Today's no good for going out... Hmm... Did I say that yesterday as well?
Lisa,When It Rains,*sigh* Perfect weather for sipping a cup of tea while gazing out the window.
Lisa,When Thunder Strikes,"When I practice my spells in weather like this, I can do half the work for double the impact. Haha, I'm just teasing."
Lisa,When It's Windy,"Such a calming breeze... Perfect for taking a nap, don't you think?"
Lisa,Good Morning,"*yawns* Good morning, Jean... Oh it's you! Sorry, dear."
Lisa,Good Afternoon,It must almost be time for a nap...
Lisa,Good Evening,You're still up? I'm getting sleepy...
Lisa,Good Night,I can see how hard you've been working today. Let me think of a way to reward you...
Lisa,About Lisa,"I'm not lazy, I just know to save my energy for when I need it most."
Lisa,About Us: Relationships,"I can be your teacher, your master, or your friend... or all three if you want..."
Lisa,About Us: Capabilities Friendship Lv. 6,"Let me show you a thing or two, lest we let your efforts go to waste. *chuckles*"
Lisa,About Us: Ceremony Friendship Lv. 6,"Wait, one last thing... A kiss on the forehead from master to follower. Now you're my star pupil."
Lisa,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions? Ah, they're a necessary device in controlling the elements — with you being the sole exception, of course. Hmm... As for why that is, perhaps... we can find the time to experiment a little?"
Lisa,Something to Share,"Feel free to use the alchemist's upstairs from the library whenever you want. But make sure you knock first, we wouldn't want you seeing anything you're not supposed to, now would we?"
Lisa,Interesting Things,"Calla Lilies are a medicinal flower with antidotal properties. With them in hand, there's no need to worry about the side effects of any potions... Hehe."
Lisa,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,Jean is a gifted and dedicated leader. Seeing how hard she works makes even me want to help her out.
Lisa,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"Amber was just a young girl when she joined the knights, and in the blink of an eye, she's turned into such a strong young lady. I'm curious to see what she'll be like a few years from now."
Lisa,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"Have you heard Barbara sing before? Her angelic voice contains a magical healing energy. A different kind of magical energy from the one in my potions, of course. I wonder which one you prefer?"
Lisa,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"You want to know about Diluc? Haha, in that case, I know someone else you should talk to."
Lisa,About Razor Friendship Lv. 4,"Come on Razor, that's it, good boy! Let's do some combat practice — I've found you the perfect partner. Hey! Come back!"
Lisa,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Last time little Klee wanted to use my workshop for her experiments, I had to say no, and she was angry at me for the rest of the day. *sigh* What happened the next day, you ask? She went off happily to play outside of course."
Lisa,About Mona Friendship Lv. 4,"Mona? She seems to be an excellent mage, but I'm not a part of their Hexenzirkel. The idea of Irminsul exploration and formal tea parties just leaves me cold."
Lisa,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Albedo is quite the alchemist. Just say the word and he'll come up with a good solution. He's easy on the eyes too, just like you."
Lisa,About Fischl Friendship Lv. 4,"Fischl, yes, she's always in the library looking to borrow fantasy novels. She always returns her books three days early and looks after them very well. She's a good kid."
Lisa,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"Every time I ask Noelle to dust off the bookshelves, I'm always left with the sense that the more exhausted I make her, the happier she becomes. Yes, who knows what's going on with her... *chuckles*"
Lisa,About Sucrose Friendship Lv. 4,"Try not to bother Sucrose if you're at a loose end, you'll only startle the poor girl. She's gifted at interacting with all sorts of exotic creatures — just hopeless when it comes to humans."
Lisa,About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4,"I've barely kept in touch with anyone from the Akademiya since leaving Sumeru, except for the occasional letters to my teachers out of basic courtesy. Fortunately, not every promising student turned out as lazy as I am... I heard that one of my juniors, Cyno, now leads quite the action-packed life."
Lisa,About Collei Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, dear little Collei. Every time she writes to me, she tries out new words and expressions she's learned recently... Hehe, no wonder she's improving so quickly. That wonderful and warmhearted master of hers must have helped a lot too."
Lisa,About Mika Friendship Lv. 4,"I do rather envy Huffman for having such a caring little brother. Mika takes care of everything around the house and even looks after him when he's drunk... Ah, how nice it must be to lounge around all day without a care in the world... Hmm? What do you mean, I already do that? You're getting quite bold these days, aren't you, cutie?"
Lisa,More About Lisa: I,"So, which element would you like to learn about today?"
Lisa,More About Lisa: II Friendship Lv. 3,"My past? So, you want to get to know me a little better, huh? *chuckles* That's a story for another day. But I'm touched that you asked."
Lisa,More About Lisa: III Friendship Lv. 4,"When I taught Razor how to utilize Elemental Energy, I never expected him to master the technique so quickly. Come to think of it, you're talented too. Maybe I could teach you a few tricks..."
Lisa,More About Lisa: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"What's that? You want to learn some Sumeru Akademiya magic? I'm afraid it might too much for you to handle right now... Hmm, though I suppose it can't hurt to teach you some of the basics. Here, start by reading the beginner's guide, it's only 800 pages or so."
Lisa,More About Lisa: V Friendship Lv. 6,"A Vision may seem like a great tool, but one day, the power one accumulates always finds a way to turn back on you. Should such a day come for me, so long as you're around... Ah, never mind."
Lisa,Lisa's Hobbies,"Hey darling, would you like to try one of my magic potions? There's no knowing what it will do to you until you try it, though... Don't say I didn't warn you!"
Lisa,Lisa's Troubles,The interrogation room upstairs has sat there unused for two years now... It would be a much more lively place if Hertha would agree to let me use it as my private workshop... *sigh* She's such a spoilsport.
Lisa,Favorite Food,"I like making my own vegetable soup. I put a big bunch of vegetables into a cauldron and stir it with a long spoon. What does it taste like? Here, why don't you try it for yourself. Open wide!"
Lisa,Least Favorite Food,"I suffer from extreme pumpkinphobia. The fall harvest is a difficult time of year for me, as you can imagine. I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to make all the pumpkins in the world disappear..."
Lisa,Receiving a Gift: I,"Oh aren't you just the sweetest? Thanks, cutie, you just made my day."
Lisa,Receiving a Gift: II,"Hehe, you've really got a knack for this, haven't you?"
Lisa,Receiving a Gift: III,Oh my... This is really... hmm...
Lisa,Birthday,"Here, take this amulet, it will bring you good luck. It's my birthday gift to you. I spent a long time making it, so don't lose it now!"
Lisa,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Surely you don't want me working overtime... That would be no good.
Lisa,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Chances to practice should be left to you newcomers, no?"
Lisa,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"*chuckles* If I were to recover my full power, who knows what kind of things just might happen?"
Lisa,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I've already tried to persuade you every way possible... *sigh* Have it your way, cutie. I can no longer go on pretending at this point - Even a Hilichurl would see through the act. So be it, let me introduce you to the true Witch of Purple Rose."
Mona,Hello,"I am Astrologist Mona Megistus, meaning ""The Great Astrologist Mona."" If it is divination you seek from me, then I ask you respect my name by learning it wholly, here and now."
Mona,Chat: Astrology,Divination is about precisely foretelling one's written destiny. Over-embellishing that fate only leads to misconception.
Mona,Chat: Life,Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them.
Mona,Chat: Fate,"Fate is called as such, for it cannot be changed, nor can it be reversed. It can only but be accepted."
Mona,When It Rains,"With rain this heavy, not only are the stars clouded, so too is my scryglass hazy."
Mona,When Thunder Strikes,Which of the starry skies do these thunderbolts fall from?
Mona,When It Snows,The pure waters of melted snow are optimal for hydromancy.
Mona,When the Sun Is Out,One need not scry to know today's weather will be good.
Mona,Good Morning,"Your arrival is untimely. The morning star has just waned... Breakfast? No, I—I've already eaten."
Mona,Good Afternoon,"Noon is upon us, we should eat. Hm? I... I will have a salad, for simplicity is the way of the astrologer."
Mona,Good Evening,Nightfall has arrived. I will soon be able to begin my divination. Ah... did I finish writing my astrology column last night...?
Mona,Good Night,"It's already so late, and I'm no further along on finishing tomorrow's astrology column. What? You're off to sleep? *sigh* I wish I could sleep now too..."
Mona,About Mona,"The work of the astrologer is to show people what fate has in store for them, and that's exactly what I do. There will always be those however, who are unable to accept what they are told."
Mona,About Us: Work,"Why do I write reports, rather than using my divination to earn Mora? I would never use hydromancy for the sake of Mora, nor did I learn hydromancy for that purpose."
Mona,About Us: My fate Friendship Lv. 6,"I don't know. Unless left with no other choice, astrologers do not foretell their own fate. The elders of my art warned against it, for it can turn fate in on itself, which is incredibly dangerous."
Mona,About Us: Your fate Friendship Lv. 6,"As you are not from this world, I am unable to give you a prediction. All I can tell you is that your journey is far from over."
Mona,About the Vision: Disdain Friendship Lv. 3,"When I first received my Vision, the elderly woman that gave it to me, she put on this air and said ""May your heart of truth be with you."" And yet this thing does nothing for my hydromancy, all it does is get me wet."
Mona,About the Vision: Value Friendship Lv. 5,"That said, a Vision doesn't hurt to have as a little accessory. It is, after all, the one useful study tool that miserly old lady ever gave me, in a rare act of generosity."
Mona,Something to Share Friendship Lv. 6,"Do you know about constellations? Astrologers believe that the patterns of the stars map out the destinies of Vision bearers — past, present, and future, everything is written in the stars."
Mona,Interesting Things Friendship Lv. 4,"This... travel companion of yours — do you know anything of her origins? No matter what, I cannot seem to discern a single shred of information regarding this floating fairy's fate. ...Oh? So you don't know where she comes from, either?"
Mona,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"You mean the Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius? Her constellation is Leo Minor, which represents strength and responsibility shouldered too young... Though the lioness has been separated from her pride for a long time, she grows from strength to strength, and the day will come when she is ready to return as its glorious leader."
Mona,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"Albedo? Ah... I envy his ability to solely focus on his research without getting bogged down in mundane worldly affairs. What a wonderful life! If that batty old lady hadn't had one too many screws loose, perhaps that's the life I'd be living by now myself..."
Mona,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yes, Alice's daughter. She's in the custody of the Knights of Favonius, and Albedo looks after her too. She's blessed to have Trifolium as her constellation, which represents good luck. I'm slightly envious... *smirk* Although, if I'd been blessed with good luck, I suppose I never would have had the great honor of running into that old woman, would I..."
Mona,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"Diluc Ragnvindr. His constellation, Noctua, represents vigilance in the darkness of night... A lone guardian keeping watch, longing for the splendor of dawn, yet destined to solitude in the dark days preceding its arrival. ...Or, wait, maybe Noctua's the one tied to wealth...?"
Mona,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"Kaeya Alberich? He's a Pavo Ocellus. Destined for greatness and grandeur... and to hide ugly realities behind a layer of charm and elegance. He believes he has made a clean break with his past, but one day fate will catch up with him. When it does, he will have a major decision to make."
Mona,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"A Tempus Fugit... The constellation derives its name from the hourglass, and stands for knowledge and time — or rather, the trade-off between them. As each grain of sand falls down, a moment of time — of life, even, dies for good. To stop the unrelenting flow of sand, one would have to turn the hourglass on its side. But once the sand comes to rest, it remains motionless forever... Hmm, maybe 'becomes lazy' is more accurate than 'comes to rest,' in this case."
Mona,About Venti Friendship Lv. 4,"Venti? The bard that sits around doing nothing all day? What's so interesting about him? Sure, I guess I can take a look... Huh, that's weird, the scryglass, it's... I can't see a thing... this wind... I can't... open my eyes! No, my hat! Ah! My clothes, stop! The wind's going to strip all my clothes off! Make it stop, make it stop! ...Alright, alright! I'll never do this again!"
Mona,More About Mona: I,"You want to chat... for fun? Oh... I don't usually have spare time for such activities, especially when I have so many columns left to write... Then again, since it's you, it might be worth it. Hehe, a change of pace once in a while isn't such a bad thing."
Mona,More About Mona: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Income? From astrology...? You can't use... things like Mora to determine the value of astrology! You need to understand: hydromancy is the one and only means of discerning people's true destiny in the whole of Teyvat! No matter how much Mora or gems you might have, the value of fate is quite incalculable! Perhaps not the smartest question you might have had for me..."
Mona,More About Mona: III Friendship Lv. 4,You want me to explain how astrology works? I'm not sure you'd understand even if I told you. But since you ask... The method I use is called hydromancy. The art of inferring fate from the illusory reflection of the stars on the water's surface. The inverted reflection in the water is an image of the heavens from within which the truth of our world can be observed. ...It is the one and only success story of that old lady's research endeavors.
Mona,More About Mona: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Mona Megistus, the Astrologist — we came up with that name together, the old lady and me. She said it had a nice ring to it... But then she started calling me 'Meg' for short, which I hate, because obviously 'Mona' is already sufficient for a shorter name — No! You are NOT allowed to call me that, it's embarrassing! Gah! I knew I shouldn't have told you!"
Mona,More About Mona: V Friendship Lv. 6,"The golden rule all fortune tellers abide is: never offer advice. Only state the results of the divination. Otherwise, you risk your fate becoming tangled up with that of your subject. But for you, I will make an exception to this rule — because our fates have been intertwined from the beginning."
Mona,Mona's Hobbies,"My hobby? Stargazing! In this all-too-real world in which we live, we all need to look up from the dust once in a while and fix our gaze on the stars, in a spirit of wonder... that, plus the whole thing about me being an astrologer."
Mona,Mona's Troubles,"The equipment repair bill is due, and so is the final payment for that celestial globe I ordered... Also, I still need to renew my journal subscriptions, not to mention pay the rent... Hmm, which one to prioritize? ...Ah, I'll pay off the celestial globe first, if I leave it any longer they'll sell out and then I'll never get my hands on one..."
Mona,Favorite Food,"Salad. Salad is by far the best food in the world. Cheap to buy, easy to whip up, filling, and it's the most convenient thing there is when you're working on a column or fixing some equipment — I mean, who's got time for a proper dinner anyway?"
Mona,Least Favorite Food,"You know, all those... overpriced, fancy foods. Personally, I think it's uncivilized and, frankly, dangerous to splash out and indulge yourself every time you have a little hunger pang."
Mona,Receiving a Gift: I,"Ah, so satisfied... Who would have thought knowing you would bear so many benefits."
Mona,Receiving a Gift: II,Just to be clear... you're sure I don't have to pay... for any of this?
Mona,Receiving a Gift: III,"I don't mean to nitpick, or anything, it's just... I haven't quite eaten enough."
Mona,Birthday,"Happy Birthday. Here's my gift to you — it's a bag containing some words of advice that may help you through tough patches. ...No, don't open it yet. During the year ahead, this bag will open itself when the right time comes."
Mona,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,This was ordained by fate! Long had I forseen it.
Mona,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,...One step closer. Maybe soon I shall finally uncover the truth of this world?
Mona,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,My scryglass has long since preordained all that will take place beneath the stars it reflects.
Mona,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"In the reflection of the water, I see the ascension of the morning star."
Nilou,Hello,"Hello, I'm Nilou from Zubayr Theater. We have one dance scheduled for today, and it's about to start — keep your eyes peeled!"
Nilou,Chat: Practice,"First get into position like this, then move like that... Yep, that's it."
Nilou,Chat: Sleepiness,"Take a deep breath, as if you're about to blow up a huge balloon. Exhale all your sleepiness into it, and then, poof — it's now flying away!"
Nilou,Chat: Rest,Relaxing days like this are nice... Let's take it easy.
Nilou,When It Rains,"The weather and our moods are the same — they can both get gloomy. It's all right, though, because the sky will become even brighter after the rain."
Nilou,When Thunder Strikes,"Thunder is kinda scary. Are you afraid of it? If so, I can share a nifty method to help with that."
Nilou,When It Snows,"Huh? Wow, it's snowing. You can really hear the snow falling. Add in the swirling snowflakes, and it feels like the spirit of nature is dancing."
Nilou,When the Sun Is Out,Sunny days are so warm and cozy... *yawn* They make me sleepy...
Nilou,When the Wind Is Blowing,Are you all right? Watch out for sandstorms.
Nilou,Good Morning,"Good morning! Huh, why are you staring at me? ...M—My hair's sticking up? Ahh, don't look! I'll go fix it right now."
Nilou,Good Afternoon,"Uhh... Mmm... Should I eat some baked goods, or should I get something with rice? Or maybe... I can have some hummus instead?"
Nilou,Good Evening Friendship Lv. 4,Good evening! I have a performance at Zubayr Theater tonight. Want some tickets?
Nilou,Good Night,"Remember, let out all your frustrations before bedtime for a better night's rest. If you want, I'm more than happy to be your audience."
Nilou,About Nilou: Body Language,"Sometimes, you can convey more with dance than words. If you don't know what to say, then just dance."
Nilou,About Nilou: Dance and Wisdom Friendship Lv. 4,"You need an extreme amount of talent to pursue knowledge and wisdom. Many people throw their entire lives into it, only to end up burned out and depressed... Dance isn't like that. You don't have to understand what you're seeing to enjoy watching it. If I can use my movements to demonstrate the beauty and meaning of dance, then I'm happy."
Nilou,About Us: Dealing with Anger,"Are you sulking? That's no good — c'mon, follow my lead. First, use your right hand to draw a biiig circle in front of you. Then, use both hands to take all those negative feelings off your chest and into the circle. Next, push it away as hard as you can! So? Feeling better now?"
Nilou,About Us: Going on Adventures Friendship Lv. 4,"I've never left Sumeru City, but... I want to go on adventures with you. Going to new places will be fine as long as I can adjust... Umm, quick question: Inazuma's beaches won't have huge sandworms that'll suddenly jump out at us, right?"
Nilou,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"I received my Vision when I debuted on stage. If even the goddess was willing to watch my performance, then that must mean she had acknowledged the beauty of human-made art."
Nilou,Something to Share,"It's normal for hard work to produce no results. For example, no matter how hard I try, I can never understand the Rtawahists' teachings. When you're stuck, shake up your mind, flip your brain around, and change the direction you're going in."
Nilou,Interesting Things: Dance of the Crystalflies,"Crystalflies come in all sorts of colors. They're so pretty that you can't not be curious. When you quietly reach out to one, it instantly steps into an elegant and nimble dance, and flies away from you. Hehe, if I could fly, I'd take dance lessons from them."
Nilou,Interesting Things: Padisarahs,"When the Goddess of Flowers danced, real Padisarahs would bloom underneath her feet. That sounds like such a beautiful scene. I'd love to see it."
Nilou,About Cyno Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't really like interacting with people from the Akademiya because they don't view the arts too kindly. I often wonder what they do when they're bored... Huh, Cyno plays Genius Invokation TCG? I can't believe it..."
Nilou,About Tighnari Friendship Lv. 4,"I hear he's a really talented botanist. He must be good at telling apart mushrooms. At least, he would never have to worry about eating a poisonous one... I'm so jealous."
Nilou,About Collei Friendship Lv. 4,"She sometimes comes to watch my performances. She's a really hard-working Trainee Forest Ranger. One time, she warned me about getting lost. What did she mean by that? It's not like I've gotten lost before..."
Nilou,About Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4,"I heard he was the one who built the magnificent Palace of Alcazarzaray. He must have had a wonderful time making such a masterpiece, like when I'm in the middle of dance practice. Just thinking about dancing for everyone gives me so much happiness and motivation."
Nilou,About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4,"It's hard to believe that so many things have happened recently... I wanted to pick out a good present for Dehya and Dunyarzad, but I just can't make up my mind. Everyone at the Grand Bazaar has given me many suggestions, but if I took them all, it'd be too much... What should I do..."
Nilou,About Dori Friendship Lv. 4,"The big-spending merchant Dori has watched me dance before. I remember that she talked with Mr. Zubayr once, and then never came back. Did something happen? ...Huh? She wanted me to go on tour around Teyvat? No way, Mr. Zubayr definitely would've refused for me! ...Ahh, please tell me he has..."
Nilou,About Lesser Lord Kusanali Friendship Lv. 4,"The people of the Great Bazaar love Lesser Lord Kusanali. I'd love to hear her thoughts on my Dance of Sabzeruz... Oh, no, no, forget it... If she were in the audience, I'd get stage fright..."
Nilou,More About Nilou: I,"Aaagh! Sorry, I'm trying to decide what to eat, and I got lost in thought. Hee-hee, do you need help with anything?"
Nilou,More About Nilou: II Friendship Lv. 3,"My teacher taught me everything there is to know about dance, but she said that the most important thing is putting feeling into your movements. Only then can you move your audience and convey emotion. To express beauty, I must first become the embodiment of beauty."
Nilou,More About Nilou: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Sometimes, I receive letters from showgoers who say that my dancing has cheered them up. I always share this kind of happy news with everyone at Zubayr Theater. Even though I'm the one the audience sees on the stage, it's because of everyone's collective efforts that I can stand up there in the first place."
Nilou,More About Nilou: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"The Grand Bazaar occasionally hosts other kinds of performances, such as juggling showcases. I've tried juggling before, but I always end up catching the balls with my head... Mr. Zubayr and everyone else just laughed at me. They probably thought I had really good hand-eye coordination. Hee-hee, I've been exposed."
Nilou,More About Nilou: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Someone once told me that I was like a shining oasis that restored life and happiness to others with its warmth. That was nice of them to say, and I was happy to hear it, but... what I want to show people is much more than that. After spending so much time with you, though, I finally understand how it feels to have someone care for and look after you. Now... Now, I feel like that comparison is a far better one for you."
Nilou,Nilou's Hobbies,"""My life is dance,"" or ""dance is my life""... Which phrase is the better way to describe it? Agh, I'm no good at logical things like this. Anyway, I'll just keep on dancing. I want to use my performances to show the beauty of art to more people."
Nilou,Nilou's Troubles,"I still can't tell poisonous mushrooms apart from non-poisonous ones... Apparently, color doesn't mean much — poisonous mushrooms can be bright or dull. Mmm, I feel like I understand, but I also don't..."
Nilou,Favorite Food,Sweets always make you feel better! Most people in Sumeru love them. Wanna try some? I'll get some for you!
Nilou,Least Favorite Food,"I have a hard time eating mushrooms, mostly because I'm scared... Not the type of scared that makes you want to run away, though! When I was little, I once ate a poisonous mushroom and was bedridden for days... If you want to eat any of Sumeru's mushroom dishes, please make sure to check that the ingredients are all edible!"
Nilou,Receiving a Gift: I,This must be what it feels like to have flavors dancing on your tongue... How wonderful!
Nilou,Receiving a Gift: II,"Thank you. You must have put a lot of love and effort into this dish, just like I put so much of me into my dance practice."
Nilou,Receiving a Gift: III,"Sorry, my appetite's been a bit off lately. Please don't take offense."
Nilou,Birthday,"Umm... Happy birthday! I learned a new dance, and I want to show it to you. Uh, am I nervous? *sigh* You saw right through me. It's because... I wanted to incorporate my feelings into the moves, but then the choreography just got more and more difficult... Anyway, I just wish that your life will always be full of wonder and happiness."
Nilou,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Huh? What's this feeling...?
Nilou,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,I'm done warming up. I can do even better now!
Nilou,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I feel like I'm lying down on the back of a massive Anemo Slime. Ahh, it's so light and comfy~"
Nilou,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I really like being with you. I don't know why, but it feels like a butterfly is trying to burst out of my chest... Anyway, how about I show a new dance to you?"
Ningguang,Hello,"I am Ningguang, Tianquan of Qixing. You wish to trade? You be my personal bodyguard, and I will show you how to get ahead in Liyue."
Ningguang,Chat: Antiques,"Even if an antique is priceless, the happiness it brings lasts for only the moment you obtain it."
Ningguang,Chat: Trade War,"In a trade war, the perfect hunter leaves no trace."
Ningguang,Chat: Investments,We should look for a new investment. Mora doesn't grow on trees.
Ningguang,When It Rains,"It's raining. Fetch an umbrella for me, would you?"
Ningguang,When It Snows,"Nothing more than regular snowfall. One day I'll take you to see the ""snow"" that falls over in Liyue."
Ningguang,When the Sun Is Out,Calm weather? Do not trust your eyes. Your eyes can lie to you.

Ningguang,Good Morning,"Morning. Report your affairs, in order of priority."
Ningguang,Good Afternoon,Liuli Pavilion or Xinyue Kiosk. Which would you prefer to go to for lunch?
Ningguang,"Good Evening Farewell, Archaic Lord","The tea house has no more rooms? Then come, sit in the Jade Chamber... if you can afford the price."
Ningguang,Good Night,"Sure. Go rest. If anything important comes up, I will be sure to send for you."
Ningguang,About Ningguang: Worldview,"Be it simple price negotiation or a full-blown trade war, momentum and bargaining chips are but minor factors. To win, you need to be first to find out what cards your opponent is holding."
Ningguang,About Ningguang: Impression Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Your impressions of me have changed? Haha, well, at first I required your strength, so naturally I had to be as cordial as possible. But now that we are partners bound by contract, we may do away with such pretentious formalities."
Ningguang,About Us: Rumors,"I suppose you've heard enough rumors about me. Hehe... What kind of person am I? I shall leave that for you to decide... Of course, your judgement will become a part of the rumor."
Ningguang,About Us: Observing Friendship Lv. 6,You've been with me for some time now. Have you learned to observe? Then observe me. Observe me right down to my very core.
Ningguang,"About Us: Jade Chamber Friendship Lv. 6 Farewell, Archaic Lord","Come forward, stand beside me. Do you see the Jade Chamber? At first it was just a room, and now it clouds Liyue. When the time comes that it hangs above all of the seven nations, you shall stand by my side on that day too."
Ningguang,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"There's no need to use a Vision in affairs that Mora can solve. As far as affairs only a Vision can solve go, I know of only one..."
Ningguang,Something to Share: Banker,"Gamblers always place their bets on the next dice roll... But the bankers always have the last laugh, and they never touch a single die."
Ningguang,Something to Share: Goal Friendship Lv. 6 A New Star Approaches,"The departure of Rex Lapis will be no small test for both the Qixing and the city of Liyue. Seldom has any matter kept me tossing and turning at night like recent events.Nevertheless, I shall not lose sight of my goal. There will come a day when the shadow cast by the Jade Chamber reaches every end of Teyvat."
Ningguang,Interesting Things,"In Liyue's ancient texts, there's no shortage of mentioning the beauty of the glaze lily, but in the modern era, the flower is on the brink of extinction. Now they can only be found in Yujing Terrace, and as such to come with a hefty price tag."
Ningguang,About Beidou: Fines Friendship Lv. 4,"That... captain. She clearly receives the adoration of many, but will always be the first to disregard the rules. The fines she has paid would be enough to buy her a whole new ship..."
Ningguang,About Beidou: Attitude Friendship Lv. 4,Perhaps you've never heard me speak like this. All that can be said has been said — both the good and the bad — but she still does as she pleases. Forget it. Keep Beidou out of my sight.
Ningguang,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli... Of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. He's very versed in a great deal of affairs. Although... such excellent pawns are of no use to me until I know their weaknesses.
Ningguang,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"The second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. People like him can't stand the sight of me, which is only to be expected. I have no intention of troubling him either. Those who have different beliefs should not work together."
Ningguang,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"That girl from Wanmin Restaurant... Her suspicion towards me is always written all over her face... Hehe, I wonder what face she would make if only she knew how much I helped finance that restaurant..."
Ningguang,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"One cannot afford to be overly reliant on others — even when it comes to Ganyu. There is a Liyue saying which goes, ""Even the most meticulous can fall prey to happenstance."" When there are important affairs to deal with, it is always safer to investigate and resolve it personally."
Ningguang,About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4,"I presume you mean the girl whom Ganyu has taken under her wing. Do not worry, I have no plans to make this matter public. I am content to extend some leniency to the odd bit of mischievous maneuvering by that boat captain. One thing, though — Yaoyao seems to have become somewhat enamored with seafood lately. You should try to convince her to include some more fruits and vegetables in her diet."
Ningguang,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Yuheng... She has changed a lot recently. But is Liyue better off with the Yuheng we have now, or the Yuheng we used to know? Only time will tell.(Actual Voice-Over: The Yuheng... She has changed a lot recently. But is Liyue better off with the Yuheng we have now, or the Yuheng we used to know? Only time will tell.)"
Ningguang,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"The Acting Grand Master of Mondstadt, a strict and impeccable woman. Her flawless etiquette knows no fault, even her letters are meticulously written and creased according to the prescribed rules. It is such easily overlooked details that offer a glimpse into the true qualities of one's character."
Ningguang,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4,"Yanfei? I suppose you could say she's a dear rival of mine... Were she not so deft at explaining the meanders of the law and providing her clients with all sorts of cunning suggestions, it would take me many more months to identify existing loopholes in the legal codices and tighten them one by one."
Ningguang,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"How is Miss Shenhe doing as of late? Please, look out for her whenever you can. I am most grateful to both of you for your assistance with rebuilding the Jade Chamber. Ahem, and on a more personal note — please know that if you are ever free, a cup of the finest tea will always be waiting for you here."
Ningguang,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"Yun Jin... Are you able to appreciate her performances? It might be difficult at first, but I would encourage you to give it a chance. The reason why I decided to invest into her opera troupe is quite simple: Elegant art forms like these deserve to be passed down to future generations."
Ningguang,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"She's a very interesting character. I can say with the utmost confidence that she is someone I trust unreservedly. She handles herself impeccably, which means she stays beyond reproach. Hehe, since you both have high intelligence in common, hopefully you will get along very well."
Ningguang,More About Ningguang: I,"Seeing as it's you, there's no need to keep up the formalities. You can be a little more casual. But I still ask that you respect my time. If you have something to say, be concise — I have no time to waste."
Ningguang,More About Ningguang: II Friendship Lv. 3,I've always believed that children are the most naive and innocent. The reports they give me are of the most value. So what about you? What will you have for me?
Ningguang,More About Ningguang: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I've been thinking about something lately. If I were to keep you in Liyue, perhaps... at the right time, I might be able to leverage this city to... For now, it's mere conjecture. I should really consider whether the investment is worth it some more."
Ningguang,More About Ningguang: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"You can learn from me, and use Mora to make things a little easier for yourself. But remember, relationships built on Mora can only be relied on for a time. Hehe... and that is why I have never brought Mora into our relationship."
Ningguang,More About Ningguang: V Friendship Lv. 6,"This is truly a great investment. Sure, no Mora has been made from it, but the time I've spent with you is already a solid return. Haha, seems I win again — I put my money on the right person."
Ningguang,Ningguang's Hobbies,Care for a game of Liyue Millennial? It'll give me an opportunity to see exactly how good you are as a player.
Ningguang,Ningguang's Troubles,"Concerns? If I told you the concerns of the Liyue Qixing, do you think your shoulders could bear the burden? And, if you ever make the mistake of mentioning them to others..."
Ningguang,Favorite Food,A slow-boiled soup of leftover chicken and pork bones drenched over some cabbage leaves. I have few culinary requirements. Having a few staple dishes like this is enough.
Ningguang,Least Favorite Food,"I've come across those who demand golden crab for every meal. Though it all seems so grandiose, I really have no desire for such frivolousness. If you're ever thinking of taking me out for such a dinner, you'd be better off just giving the Mora to me directly."
Ningguang,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm... You have surpassed my expectations, again."
Ningguang,Receiving a Gift: II,"With some things, if you haven't grasped the essentials, all the hard work in the world can go to waste... Know what I mean?"
Ningguang,Receiving a Gift: III,Ugh... It's the thought that counts.
Ningguang,Birthday (Aether Version),"These are some of Liyue's finest brocades, woven from silk flowers. This one is for you, and this one... I hope that someday soon, you will be able to give it to your sister and I hope that she'll like it. I wish you both a happy birthday."
Ningguang,Birthday (Lumine Version),"This is one of Liyue's finest brocades, woven from Silk Flowers. You can use it to have some clothing made, and have a happy birthday."
Ningguang,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,There's no style in resorting to violence. It's simply the worst of all the bad decisions you could make.
Ningguang,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,Cashing in time and Mora for power... Interesting. This shows their true value.
Ningguang,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"What is it that you hold so dear that is making you so persistent...? No, don't tell me. Give me more time to understand you myself."
Ningguang,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I'm usually not so quick to place my trust in others, but it seems I will no longer be able to make such claims. You've done splendidly. If only I had more like you... No, perhaps you... alone are enough."
Noelle,Hello,"My name is Noelle, maid of the Knights of Favonius, and it's my pleasure to be joining you on your adventure today. Should you encounter any problems at any point throughout your journey, please do not hesitate to call me and I will be delighted to provide you with my full assistance. Yes, starting right now — what do you need?"
Noelle,Chat: A Favor,"Leave it to me! All of it, whatever it is! ...What... exactly is ""it""? I didn't quite catch your request..."
Noelle,Chat: Rest,"You seem tired. Would you like some tea? I'll brew you some. Do you take sugar? One cube, or two?"
Noelle,Chat: Being Reliable,"Whenever you need me, I'll be there."
Noelle,When It Rains,"Oh dear, everyone's laundry is still on the line! May I be excused to fetch it in?"
Noelle,When Thunder Strikes,Please stay indoors until the storm passes. I will deal with any urgent outdoor business.
Noelle,When the Sun Is Out,"Such fair weather. Why don't we do a bit of sunny work? Oh, what sort of work is that, you ask? Haha, well, anything that makes you feel bright and sunny too."
Noelle,When It's Windy,Can you hear the Anemo Archon's voice on the breeze? It calms me down whenever I get flustered.
Noelle,Good Morning,"Good morning! Breakfast is served. I will be on hand the whole time. Should you find that anything is not to your taste, please, do not hesitate to let me know."
Noelle,Good Afternoon,"Ready for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Lighter-Than-Air Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.(Actual Voice-Over: Ready for your tea break? Please wait here while I get it ready. Oh yes, I also made Tea Break Pancakes! You simply must try one, it's my specialty.)"
Noelle,Good Evening,"Everyone has free time in the evening, and that is when I am busiest. Where have Amber's washed hairbands been placed? How many new eyepatches did Kaeya buy? Keeping track of all these things is a maid's responsibility."
Noelle,Good Night Friendship Lv. 4,"Please get some rest, you must be tired from today's adventure. I should head back to the Knights of F— Sorry? you want me to watch over you until you fall asleep? I—I... I mean, of course, it's no problem. But, um... You're not just teasing me, are you?"
Noelle,About Noelle: Discipline,"In my job I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words."
Noelle,About Noelle: Disagreement,"I'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?"
Noelle,About Us: Identities,"I am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake — I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!"
Noelle,About Us: Reminders,"Even when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables. Oh, and no swimming right after a meal. Haha, I do hope you're not thinking, ""that's too much trouble I'll just leave it to Noelle,"" are you? ... Oh... but of course, if you are... Well then, just leave it to me."
Noelle,About Us: Welcome Party Friendship Lv. 6 For a Tomorrow Without Tears,"So I hear you're an Honorary Knight of Favonius? I envy you! I suppose that makes you my senior... Anyway, it's about time someone threw you a welcome party, surely? Leave it to me!"
Noelle,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius..."
Noelle,Something to Share,"I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There have been a few times when I could have had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older."
Noelle,Interesting Things,"A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying ""As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed."" It reminds me to— What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning."
Noelle,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, don't you think?(Actual Voice-Over: I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed! There is no risk of explosion whatsoever.)"
Noelle,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement..."
Noelle,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!"
Noelle,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!"
Noelle,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, ""errand runner""? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!"
Noelle,About Bennett Friendship Lv. 4,"He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his ""dads"" like the other adventurers... the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer."
Noelle,About Fischl: Tea Friendship Lv. 4,"I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely, I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying."
Noelle,About Fischl: Background Friendship Lv. 6,"So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her."
Noelle,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara."
Noelle,More About Noelle: I,"How may I be of assistance? ...Oh, you just want to chat? Okay then! Well, if that's how I can help, then please feel free to chat as long as you'd like."
Noelle,More About Noelle: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Not a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you."
Noelle,More About Noelle: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Th—These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour... Ah, ok maybe an hour, tops. You can busy yourself with other things first, and I'll be sure to deliver them right to you, hot and fresh out of the oven!"
Noelle,More About Noelle: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems."
Noelle,More About Noelle: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Even though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people. These days, though, I seem to be spending more and more of my time with you... It might be a bit selfish of me... What do you think?"
Noelle,Noelle's Hobbies,"My hobby? I really like washing all sorts of things... clothes, floorboards, windows, you name it! Whenever I see something dirty I just want to give it a good old clean! It just gives me such a sense of achievement! ...Oh, you mean the things I do in my free time? Hmm... Same answer!"
Noelle,Noelle's Troubles,"How to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself... I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!"
Noelle,Favorite Food,"My favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate — highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it — it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now."
Noelle,Least Favorite Food,"I'm not a fussy eater. But I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid I am expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt..."
Noelle,Receiving a Gift: I,How can you make such a simple dish taste so good? My admiration towards you just keeps growing!
Noelle,Receiving a Gift: II,"This tastes wonderful! Uh, would you mind teaching me how to make this? After all, it is my duty as a maid..."
Noelle,Receiving a Gift: III,Hmm... This is more than I normally eat in a whole day...
Noelle,Birthday,"Since you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely? Well, you need not worry about them adding up, because today, I am all yours — your exclusive maid for the entire day! Just leave it all to me! ...Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you a very happy birthday!"
Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,What is this... new power!? Thank you! Now I can be of assistance to even more people.
Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"I cannot rest on my laurels. After all, I'm not even formally a knight yet. Until that day, I must work even harder."
Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Thank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot. As a maid, I should be the one serving you, but it seems you have done more for me than I could ever imagine..."
Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Everyone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think... What!? You think so too!? Oooohh, thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!"

Qiqi,More About Qiqi: III Friendship Lv. 4,Some people want to take advantage of me. Others are terrified of me. But you... You are not like any of those people.
Qiqi,More About Qiqi: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Since we first met, I have had a warm feeling inside. Not the kind of warmth that makes me feel rotten. The other kind of warm. The one that happens inside my heart. Thank you. I am happy. Sadly I only recognize the current you. If I forget you... No. I will order myself to remember you."
Qiqi,More About Qiqi: V Friendship Lv. 6,"In the past, my only thought was: I must stay alive. Even though I didn't know what to live for. But now, I think I know. I want to live with you. I want to ask, can we stay together, for the rest of life, until death? Yes or no? Yes? Is that your real answer? Good, excellent.

Qiqi,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Now, I have more power. But what does that mean? Please explain. Thank you."
Qiqi,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Ah, I understand. When I get stronger, I need to put more effort into controlling my strength."

Raiden Shogun,Hello,"No salutations needed. My exalted status shall not be disclosed as we travel among the common folk. I acknowledge that you are a person of superior ability. Henceforth, you will be my guard. Worry not. Should any danger arise, I shall dispose of it."
Raiden Shogun,Chat: Idleness,Inactivity serves no purpose whatsoever. Hmph.
Raiden Shogun,Chat: The Mortal World,The world remains constant over the centuries. But human life is like the dew at dawn or a bubble rising through water. Transitory.
Raiden Shogun,Chat: Worldly Beauty,All the world holds dear is but a backdrop of constant motion. I stand before it alone and unchanging.
Raiden Shogun,When It Rains,Rainfall alone does not constitute a storm. Thunder is required.
Raiden Shogun,When It Snows,The Winter Shogun approaches.[TN • 1]
Raiden Shogun,On a Clear Day,Clear skies can do nothing to hide the brilliance of lightning. Divine bolts can strike even in the absence of rain. Do you see that tree? Wait...you understand? So... demonstration is not required? Good.
Raiden Shogun,Good Morning,"Yawning without covering your mouth? Uncouth. I will pardon your rudeness this time. Good morning to you, too."
Raiden Shogun,Good Night,I command the thunder in all corners of the world to cease. Rest well tonight.
Raiden Shogun,About the Raiden Shogun: Transience,"Thunder's roar and lightning's flash. So ephemeral. This is why reaching Eternity is desirable. ...Actually, this is why reaching Eternity is necessary."
Raiden Shogun,About the Raiden Shogun: Eternity,"Erosion is a terrible thing. This body's purpose is to withstand wear and tear, that the one within might achieve Eternity."

Raiden Shogun,About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4,"Indeed. It was I who slew Orobaxi. But I also allowed the people of Sangonomiya to continue worshiping it as the Watatsumi Omikami, so that it might enjoy their offerings.

Raiden Shogun,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,Who?

Raiden Shogun,More About the Raiden Shogun: II Friendship Lv. 3,"On stormy days, the people of Inazuma chant ""kuwabara, kuwabara,"" believing that this will protect themselves from being struck by lightning. You need not worry about any storm summoned by my own hand — they will bring you no harm. Lightning storms that occur naturally, however, can be more unpredictable."
Raiden Shogun,The Raiden Shogun's Hobbies,Foolish question. There are only two kinds of things — those that must be done and those that must not.
Raiden Shogun,Least Favorite Food,Foolish question. There are only two kinds of foods — those that must be consumed to nourish the body and those that harm it.

Raiden Shogun,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"The initial stage of my journey, or Shoden, involves learning the nine-way sword slash and the foundations of the art of the polearm. There is no great variation from other traditions at this point. Or rather, it is the other traditions that do not differ from mine."
Raiden Shogun,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"At the intermediate stage of my journey, or Chuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. The art of the polearm — slashes and backslashes."
Raiden Shogun,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"The final stage of my journey, or Kaiden, is the study of the most profound techniques. Unavoidably, these draw heavily on elemental power, rendering them beyond the capabilities of most mortals. Most practitioners of other traditions are unable to ever reach this level."

Rosaria,Good Afternoon,I'd say I sleep even better in the afternoon sun. You should try it sometime.
Rosaria,Good Evening,Good evening. Don't expect to see me at prayer tonight... And don't ask why.
Rosaria,Good Night,"Go ahead, take a break. I'll handle things here."
Rosaria,About Rosaria: Sister,"Me? I'm just another ordinary person. Church, work... I just do what I have to do."
Rosaria,About Rosaria: Troubles,"Each of the Sisters is worse than the next. If it's not about prayer, then it's about choir or some other thing I'm supposed to participate in... I'm trying to stay out of sight, so don't you dare tell them you saw me here."
Rosaria,About Us: Beliefs,"Perhaps a god has the power to protect everyone if they would choose to do so, but that would never happen. Otherwise, people's suffering couldn't ever be taken seriously."
Rosaria,About Us: Prayer Friendship Lv. 6,"Pray. Not for the gods, nor the betterment of others... but for yourself."
Rosaria,About Us: Battle Friendship Lv. 6,Don't overdo it. Let me take care of the dirty work.
Rosaria,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"A Vision... Could be proof of strength, or a medal for having survived... who knows? There're two sides to every coin. I won't limit my Vision with ceremonies and definitions. It witnesses me, and I witness it, that's all."
Rosaria,Something to Share Friendship Lv. 4,"You don't always know why good things happen, or why we should be happy about them. Heh... But if you ever face a problem too big to handle, don't give up hope. You never know, someone may be there to help, even if you can't see them."
Rosaria,Interesting Things,"I take no interest in plant life and the sort, but the dandelion is an exception. How such a simple flower could turn into such a delectable wine is beyond me. A glass of dandelion wine after work is even better than sleeping in on Sunday."
Rosaria,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"Isn't it obvious? There's more than meets the eye to that rich tycoon. He's confident, yet discreet... and even a little bit dangerous."
Rosaria,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"Wine has its uses... like revealing someone's true colors, for example. Smooth talk is Kaeya's veil, but being me, I can see right through it. Hah, you should see him when he's drunk."
Rosaria,About Venti Friendship Lv. 4,There's something extremely interesting about this bard... I can't quite put my finger on it. There's something that makes him different from the others in Mondstadt.
Rosaria,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"Barbara is like a thorn in my side, always nagging me about mass and choir practice. I wouldn't be surprised if Sister Victoria specifically asked her to keep an eye on me."
Rosaria,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,She's not only competent in her own work but also somehow manages to clear up various matters for others... Huh. Now that's a woman who deserves admiration.
Rosaria,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"He's like an oil painting you find hanging on the wall in some ancient hall, profound and mysterious... hard to see through. But what can I say, I find people with stories... interesting."
Rosaria,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"Although I deplore those who play truant on a job, I respect her punctuality when it comes to closing up for the day."
Rosaria,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Trouble, and lots of it. Although, it is sort of a cute kind of trouble..."
Rosaria,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm sure Varka means well, but his long-winded conversations get real old real quick. Although, he does really care for those around him, doesn't he?"
Rosaria,About Her Father Friendship Lv. 4,"Father? I'm not familiar with the word. You could say that I don't have one — could also say I have many, too. What's it to you?"
Rosaria,More About Rosaria: I,Let's forgo the formalities. I'm here to finish a job. Just leave the dirty work to me.
Rosaria,More About Rosaria: II Friendship Lv. 3,"What's weird about a Sister without reverence for the gods? There are hunters who don't eat pork, and fisherman who don't eat fish, aren't there? Just because you do something doesn't mean you love to do it. That's how every job goes."
Rosaria,More About Rosaria: III Friendship Lv. 4,This year's Dandelion Wine is sinfully good. Care for a glass?
Rosaria,More About Rosaria: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Mondstadt is a beast of light, both old and young. Old in the sense that it constantly requires someone's protection, yet too young to ever survive on its own. That's why there's people like me. I care for Mondstadt just as the other Sisters care for the believers, we are all guiding that which we love onward on the path towards freedom. Huh? Why do I call it a beast of light? Because people like myself can only be found in the dark..."
Rosaria,More About Rosaria: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I sometimes feel that my former selves from years past still exist alongside me, urging me on. I'm sure you know the feeling, too. Even if you decide to venture down a new path, don't just abandon the former you. For that is the foundation upon which you now take footing. Do not fear your past, and do not be scared to come to grips with it."
Rosaria,Rosaria's Hobbies,"There are some troubles that only a stiff drink can take away. That being said, I never get drunk."
Rosaria,Rosaria's Troubles,"Ugh, definitely skipping next month's choir concert, but I bet Sister Victoria will be personally taking roll... What a nuisance."
Rosaria,Favorite Food,"Have you ever tried Beef Bourguignon? Big chunks of meat with the smooth taste of alcohol... Mmm, it's delectable."
Rosaria,Least Favorite Food,"You mean I'm supposed to dip this hash brown in jam? Ugh, this is sacrilege!"
Rosaria,Receiving a Gift: I,It seems that our tastes are aligned when it comes to food.
Rosaria,Receiving a Gift: II,At least I'll be able to eat my fill with this.
Rosaria,Receiving a Gift: III,Do you really like this food?
Rosaria,Birthday,"Today's your birthday, so if you have any dirty work that needs taking care of, I can give you a hand... Just don't tell anybody, got it?"
Rosaria,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Hmm, just what I needed."
Rosaria,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,You have a job for me? I've got time.
Rosaria,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,Good. Getting stronger means finishing jobs quicker.
Rosaria,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I'm no stranger to spilling blood, but never have I possessed such power before. For such blessings, I give you thanks."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Hello,"I am Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. My journey with you will be an opportunity to unwind... Ahem, I mean... to survey beyond our borders. Don't worry, I've left behind ample directives in my absence, and have also completed the island's projected development plans. Departing for a brief period will be of little consequence."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Chat: Reading,Yae Publishing House has released numerous works that lay out military strategy in a simple and pragmatic way. Those are my favorite.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Chat: Fish,Respect must be given to the will of every creature. Each fish in the ocean swims in its own direction.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Chat: Preparation,"To survive hardship, you must prepare for hardship."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,When It Rains,"Marching in the rain conceals the sound of our arrival, but is also a test of stamina..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,When It Snows,The snow... have you ever seen such beauty?
Sangonomiya Kokomi,When the Sun Is Out,Such fortunate weather... Care for a walk?
Sangonomiya Kokomi,When the Wind Is Blowing,Mm... High winds. An incendiary attack would be particularly effective.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Good Morning,"Good morning. I've just read a fascinating stratagem, would you like to study it together?"
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Good Afternoon,"Mmmm... to improve efficiency, we must make some adjustments to our battle plan for the afternoon."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Good Evening,Mm? Night already? Time seems to slip away when I'm with you.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Good Night,Good night. Garner your strength for the battles ahead.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Directives,"The battlefield is unpredictable — one false move could mark utter defeat. Before the onset of battle, I bring every possible scenario into consideration, and turn my thoughts into written directives. These are then issued to the troops. ...It does seem at present like they're somewhat over-reliant on the directives, which worries me... If they read up on military strategy themselves, they could begin to rely on their own ability to read the battlefield. I need them to be able to identify and seize opportunities in the heat of the moment."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Relaxing,"Mm... I hope we can put an end to this battle quickly. The Yae Publishing House has just released a new volume of ""A Legend of Sword."" Ah, I'd like nothing more than to curl up with a copy in my room and read it front to back."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Us: Experience,"My mother once taught me that it takes a broad outlook to become a qualified leader. However, my younger years were mostly spent traveling between Sangonomiya and the army. I never had time to embark on my own adventure. So... there are many aspects of adventuring that I've yet to fully understand. Mm, you'll have to excuse my lack of experience in this area."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Us: Confusion Friendship Lv. 6,"It's said that the depths of a person's heart run deep indeed. Yet, as the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, it is my duty to strive to understand each person's thoughts. Let's start with you, Traveler. What are you thinking about now? Let me take a guess..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"In my book, Visions are symbols of aspiration, and aspiration is a precious thing indeed. This is exactly why the resistance was formed — to oppose the Vision Hunt Decree. Aspiration should never be abandoned or forcibly taken away."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Anything To Share: Periodicals Friendship Lv. 4,"Among Yae Publishing House's various publications, my personal favorite is the Teyvat Art of War. See, it has articles on classic military campaigns, as well as detailed analysis and commentary from famous strategists. There are a few that I particularly enjoy... Here, let me read them to you."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Anything To Share: Diving Friendship Lv. 4,"The world below water is not bright and sunny like that of dry land. Still, whenever I lend myself to the deep, my heart gradually fills with a permeating sense of peace. Fish move in faraway shoals, jellyfish dance around me, and my troubles start to simply wash away. Mmm... I could take you to see it sometime, what do you think?"
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Interesting Things Friendship Lv. 4,"I simply love Watatsumi Coral Pearls... They're not just a source of income for Watatsumi Island, but a gift from the sea itself."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,"Gorou is an exceptional general... sincere, determined, and courageous. He has a strong camaraderie with the troops and is able to come up with creative battle plans. He does, however, have one shortcoming... He often lets the excitement of battle get to his head. If you are ever deployed to the battlefield together, be sure to have a good rein on him when things get underway."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Mmm... I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities — they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"I have also heard of Guuji Yae's great deeds. In all fairness, I hold her to be an outstanding shrine maiden, and she has performed her duties marvelously. I even heard that she holds responsibility where Yae Publishing House's light novels are concerned. An enigmatic individual to say the least..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Now that the Vision Hunt Decree is over, Watatsumi Island has once again returned to normal life. It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island. It is my hope that the Shogun will fulfill her promise and that we can live with the Shogunate in peace. However, if there comes a day when she once again casts aside the aspirations of the people, I can assure you that we won't sit by and watch."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Kazuha once came and bunked with the resistance for a time. If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou — they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"Initially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed ""detective"" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: I,"No matter how pressing the situation may become, I must remain composed. If I let the stress get to me, then what can I expect from others around me?"
Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Legend has it that our ancestors lived in a palace in the depths of the ocean, and that the god, Orobashi, brought us to the surface. I've often wondered, wouldn't a palace like that be too dark? Every time I think about it, I start to really appreciate the light..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: III Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"After you left, the soldiers of Swordfish II nominated a temporary captain, but everyone was hoping that you'd return. I could only tell them that you'd been tasked with an important solo mission. If you get the chance, you should go visit them, I'm sure they'd love to see you."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"A long time ago, I had no intention of becoming the Divine Priestess. My only goal was to study military strategy and become an adviser. That way, I could remain behind the scenes and lessen my overall burden. *sigh* Fate had other ideas in store... You can't defy that which flows in your veins."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: V Friendship Lv. 6,"After becoming the Divine Priestess, I gradually grew accustomed to this life. At the very least, I have the power to change something when it doesn't sit well with me. More importantly, this title allowed me to meet you, did it not?"
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Sangonomiya Kokomi's Hobbies,"Huh? What do I enjoy? Simple. I like to find a quiet place by myself and read books on strategy... Ahh, the whole day without interruption. I'd be even happier if we looked over some of it together... One thing though... You'd have to sleep on the floor."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Sangonomiya Kokomi's Troubles Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing,"To be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my ""Divine Priestess airs"" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs. The people of Watatsumi Island need a perfect leader, not some girl who likes to wile away her time at home."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Favorite Food,"I just love eating Bird Egg Sushi. The ingredients are easy to find, and it's simple to prepare... Ah... perfect for military life. Sitting down to eat Bird Egg Sushi in the midst of war might seem a bit extravagant, but in most cases, simple food like this brings great satisfaction to the soldiers."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Least Favorite Food,"Mm... If I had to say, I'm not fond of any sort of seafood. But please, keep this strictly confidential. The fishing industry is essential to Watatsumi Island, and if word were to get out that seafood wasn't my thing, I'm afraid morale would be gravely affected."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: I,"Yummy, this is delicious! And it seems my energy is also... Ahem, I mean... Never mind..."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: II,"I like to take my time and eat slowly, that way I can enjoy it for longer."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: III,"Oh, it seems we're at an impasse."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Birthday,"Happy birthday! So, what are your plans for the day? Oh, why don't we celebrate on Watatsumi Island? First, I'll take you out at daybreak to see the sunrise, then we can go diving during the heat of the day. In the evening, we can go for a stroll around Sangonomiya Shrine. If it rains, we'll find somewhere cozy to hide out with a few strategy books, and try to bake a cake together! In any case, no need to plan anything, the grand strategist has everything thought out for you!"
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Brute force is not my modus operandi. But becoming stronger isn't a bad thing.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,I'm just bubbling with energy... We'll make a formidable force in our next fight.
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"The moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. It seems that as I go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I often used to succumb to self-doubt. I would think to myself, ""Can a person like me really hold the title of Divine Priestess?"" Now, the thought hardly crosses my mind. When I'm with you, I seem to be able to cut straight through most problems."
Sayu,Hello,"Sayu, Shuumatsuban, at your disposal! Whew, but if you don't need me right now, I'm gonna grab some sleep. Nope, no need to tuck me in — I need the extra room to grow into."
Sayu,Chat: Asleep,*yawns* *snoring*
Sayu,Chat: Work,Seems like I should have just stayed in bed today.
Sayu,Chat: Height,Surely I should be due a growth spurt by now?
Sayu,When It Rains,"Eek, let's find shelter, quick! Watering works on plants, but not people..."
Sayu,When Thunder Strikes,"Phew, this weather is wild! Best thing to do is dive under the covers where it's dark and snug and warm and nyam nyam nyam~ *sleeps*"
Sayu,When It Snows,"It's really easy to hide in weather like this. There's this ninjutsu technique called Cloak of Snow where you can pretty much make yourself invisible — all other people see when they look at you is the snowflakes dancing in the air. Wait, it's confidential though! Don't tell any of this to the shrine maiden..."
Sayu,When the Sun Is Out,"Loooove it when the weather's like this, just makes you wanna... *yawn* doze off for a while."
Sayu,When It's Windy,A windy day is a good day for a getaway.
Sayu,When the Wind Is Blowing,I always know it's time to get some shut-eye when the wind's so strong that I can't open my eyes anyway.
Sayu,Good Morning,"...Morning? Already? Okay, I'm just gonna snooze for, like, 10 more minutes... Please, just 10 minutes... No? Okay, 5 minutes then? *snores*"
Sayu,Good Afternoon,"Is it noon yet? Finally, I'm so ready for my nap."
Sayu,Good Evening,"Recon confirms, no sign of the shrine maiden within a 3-mile radius. Moving to the next phase: sleepy time!"
Sayu,Good Night,At long last... bed time... G'night...
Sayu,About Sayu: Shuumatsuban,"Yeah, I'm in the Shuumatsuban, but they only ever get me to do stuff like... *yawn* information gathering and stealing. So, y'know... it's not really a big deal if the work doesn't get done."
Sayu,About Sayu: Skiving Friendship Lv. 4,"So I don't do any important work at the Shuumatsuban, and anything that gets put off for long enough ends up getting done by someone who's more suited to it anyway. Sleep, on the other hand — that is of the utmost importance. Because I need to get enough sleep to make sure I get my growth spurt."
Sayu,About Us: Favor,"Hey, will you do me a favor and let me know if you see the shrine maiden coming? I'm just gonna, um... rest my eyes for a moment."
Sayu,About Us: Headpats Friendship Lv. 6,"I'm not a pet, y'know! Hmm, but since it's you... Okay, you can pat my head and I promise not to bite your hand. Just a little, though! If you pat someone's head too much, it stunts their growth."
Sayu,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"My sword is crazy heavy, even with my ninjutsu training there's no way I could lift it without the help of my Vision. So yeah, having a Vision is a huge help for me."
Sayu,Something to Share,"Sensei says I'll be the last ninja ever in our line. I guess it can't be helped, because this style of ninjutsu wouldn't be much help in a fight anyway — all I've been taught is how to escape and how to cover your tracks."
Sayu,Interesting Things,"Do you know the mujina? It looks similar to a tanuki, but it's way cuter. I'll take you to see one next time!"
Sayu,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4,"As the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she always looks very graceful and elegant. But she got one of the shrine maidens to keep tabs on me and make sure I don't slack off... Why would she do that?"
Sayu,About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4,"Sometimes, when I'm taking a rest up in a tree, I overhear the shrine maidens talking about him. Sounds like he's pretty important and super busy most of the time. I don't get it, though — it's only work, or whatever, so why doesn't he just... not do it?"
Sayu,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4,"He's got a Vision, and yet for some reason he pesters me about learning ninjutsu every time I run into him. I don't know what his deal is. It's not like I'd have the time to teach him anyway, I barely get enough sleep as it is."
Sayu,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"Every time she sees me she says, ""Hey, little tanuki! Let's go hang out at the festival."" Firstly, I'm not a tanuki. Secondly, I don't wanna go to a festival. Thirdly, she says she wants to hang out — but really, she just wants me to do a ninjutsu performance during the fireworks show. That's not even related to my work for the Shuumatsuban!"
Sayu,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4,"Her Excellency? Definitely not someone I'd ever get to meet. If you've got questions, maybe Miss Ayaka's the person to ask."
Sayu,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"She's always patting me on the head... I've never bitten her, though, or even said anything, because I'm frightened of how she'd react if I stood up to her. But what am I gonna do? Because if she keeps on patting my head, I'm gonna get stuck at this height forever!"
Sayu,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,Why does he have to make such a racket? And how did he get so tall!?
Sayu,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"Doesn't ring a bell, umm... What? Arataki Itto's little sidekick? Ugh, well she's definitely gotta be a sleep disturbance then. Birds of a feather flock together..."
Sayu,More About Sayu: I,Zzzz...
Sayu,More About Sayu: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Huh? You wanna know the name of my style of ninjutsu? Uhh... Y'know what, I can't think straight right now, I'm still half asleep here. Lemme snooze a while longer, maybe my mind'll be clearer when I wake up."
Sayu,More About Sayu: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Alright, fine... I'll tell you. But you'd better not laugh, or I'm never talking to you again. Uh so, my style of ninjutsu is called... um... Yoohoo Art.The reason is supposedly that our style focuses on making fun of the enemy, but still... I mean... *sigh*"
Sayu,More About Sayu: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Do you know how to climb trees? I'm an expert, I can teach you. There's this tree down at the shrine — it's the perfect place, you could just literally sleep there all day if you wanted and no one would ever find you... Uh, I just mean, it's a great place for a power nap. Next time you wanna take a nap, let me know, I'll take you there."
Sayu,More About Sayu: V Friendship Lv. 6,"It was actually sensei who gave me this outfit. They said it was modeled after the mujina, and it could help with escapes, or something... and then sensei said that I was all grown up and ready to go it alone, but that I should still be careful to protect myself... then they left me. Am I really ready to go it alone, at my height?Um... Hmm? Y—You'll keep my company? Really? Promise you won't leave me?"
Sayu,Sayu's Hobbies,"When I put my hood on, I can snooze away to my heart's content without having to worry about the shrine maiden finding me. *sigh* I think it must be one of the best feelings in the whole world."
Sayu,Sayu's Troubles: Misunderstanding,"For some reason, when people meet me for the first time, they always call me tanuki, or teddy-bear, or kitty-cat... But Sayu is just Sayu — and definitely not a tanuki."
Sayu,Sayu's Troubles: Height,"When is my growth spurt gonna come? Everyone my age practically twice my height, and I'm still... Ugh, enough, I need sleep, sleep is the answer. Good night!"
Sayu,Sayu's Troubles: Feedback Loop,"Recently someone told me that if you get annoyed too easily, that'll stunt your growth, too! ...Gah! I dunno what I can do about that..."
Sayu,Favorite Food,"High-carb foods that give you instant energy, like rice balls. If you eat one the moment you wake up, it stops you feeling so groggy and bleary-eyed. Then, you can just relax and get straight back to sleep."
Sayu,Least Favorite Food,"Can't be picky about food when you've still got growing to do! ...That said, I haven't gained any height recently — maybe I'm not eating enough vegetables? But salad isn't filling enough and sometimes it can be really bitter... *sigh*"
Sayu,Receiving a Gift: I,"I'm soooo full, time for a nap..."
Sayu,Receiving a Gift: II,If you eat enough of this... it makes you really sleepy.
Sayu,Receiving a Gift: III,Uh oh... Need an escape plan.
Sayu,Birthday,"Wanna learn some ninja skills? I can teach you! Well, only the skills I know, of course. Hmm? Why aren't I asleep? ...Uhh, because I'm not sleepy... and also because today is a special day! I had to stay awake today so I'd have the chance to say it to you in person: Happy Birthday."
Sayu,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Is it just me, or did I get a little taller!?"
Sayu,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Awesome, now I can slip away faster than ever. Hee-hee, they can't catch me now."
Sayu,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Hey, thanks for going and gathering all those materials for me. I would've gone myself, but... I probably would've got about halfway before falling asleep."
Sayu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I think I'm finally ready to go it alone now, just like sensei said I should. And... maybe it's not such a big deal now if I can't grow any taller. Because what really matters... is that I have you to keep me company."
Shenhe,Hello,"My name is Shenhe. I was born fated to bear the curse of calamity, so I am prone to bring harm to the people around me. The adepti urged me to bind my soul with red ropes to keep my homicidal nature at bay. If you are able to walk alongside me without fear... Hah, very well. Now, give me your hand."
Shenhe,Chat: Home,The assumption that every person has somewhere to call home is naive. I got used to living in the mountains alongside the birds and beasts a long time ago.
Shenhe,Chat: Motto,"Mind be purged, world be saved."
Shenhe,Chat: A Blind Polearm,"My polearm doesn't distinguish friend from foe, and there is clearly a limit to the red ropes' power. That's why I loathe crowded areas."
Shenhe,When It Rains,"In the mortal world, at times likes these, is it not customary to... use an umbrella?"
Shenhe,After the Rain,"The sky is clearing up, and so is my mood. I just hope no one shows up to bother me... if they do, I'll just make them disappear."
Shenhe,When Thunder Strikes,"In this weather, I can freeze monsters in place and simply let the lightning bolts take care of the rest. A good way to not get my clothes dirty."
Shenhe,When the Wind Is Blowing,Yes... This reminds me of Master. She loves to ride the swift winds of Qingyun Peak.
Shenhe,Good Morning,"Good morning. The dew is very sweet today, would you like some?"
Shenhe,Good Afternoon,"If you feel fatigued after lunch, you should try meditating. It's very effective."
Shenhe,Good Evening,"Do you prefer the artificial light of the cities and towns, or the moonlight in the mountains?"
Shenhe,Good Night Friendship Lv. 4,"Feel free to rest. I'm a light sleeper, if I hear anything in the vicinity, I'll investigate it for you."
Shenhe,About Shenhe: Instinct,"For all the training I've had — honing my body and mind, learning the adepti arts — I've mostly been guided by my own instincts. It just comes down to self-preservation. I'm not trying to save the world, so if I wipe out some evil presence and it happens to benefit you, don't thank me. It's just a force of habit."
Shenhe,About Shenhe: Different Friendship Lv. 4,"If I treat people kindly, they call me an adeptus, and if I put them in their place, they call me a witch. Heh... The one thing you'll never hear them call me is ""human."" They all seem to agree that I'm fundamentally... different from them."
Shenhe,About Us: Manners,"I rarely leave the mountains, so I was never taught proper manners. When a conflict arises, I just take care of it the way that comes naturally to me. But if you don't approve of my methods, please do let me know. Even if I don't fully understand your reasoning, I will always defer to you."
Shenhe,About Us: Red Ropes Friendship Lv. 6 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"My master gave me these red ropes in order to restrain my impulses. But during our journey together, I feel I have finally grasped the key to all of this. Somehow, controlling my strength — knowing when to restrain myself, and when to unleash — it comes more naturally to me now. I think that what saves me from myself is not my red ropes... but you. If you understand what that means to me, please stay by my side."
Shenhe,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"So this shiny gemstone is called a ""Vision""? Heh... the gifts that fate brings, fate can just easily take away. If one day my connection to this Vision comes to an end, that'll be it, and the light inside of it will go out."
Shenhe,Something to Share,"Driving evil spirits away comes easily to me. Getting rid of my inner demons, however... Unless you can find a way to let go, all the adepti arts and exorcism techniques in the world can't save you."
Shenhe,Interesting Things,"Why do I always hear people say, ""The first snow of the season is a sight for sore eyes""? We have snow every single day in the mountains. So which instance counts as the ""first snow""? I don't understand what they mean. Please explain this to me."
Shenhe,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"I have no use for the wealth that ordinary people desire. But in the hands of Lady Ningguang, wealth becomes a means of solving complex issues of the kind that no weapons could ever hope to resolve. She understands the unwritten rules of human society, she knows what's in people's hearts... Master once told me that even the adepti aren't able to achieve this. I hold her and her work in high regard."
Shenhe,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship... I need you to go with me. It's the only way I can cope with so many people."
Shenhe,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"Yun Jin performs... It's called ""Liyue opera,"" isn't it? I like this particular type of social interaction. You can get to know about the other person's background without having to actually interact with them one on one. If she ever includes your story in one of her performances, I'm sure the result will end up being quite incredible. I'm looking forward to it."
Shenhe,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"I've heard many stories about her from my master. She's really quite different from how I originally imagined her... But don't worry, I'll be keeping this to myself. Speaking of Ganyu, her work in Liyue Harbor is unbelievably busy... It seems that there is a price to pay for those who want to integrate into the mortal world."
Shenhe,About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4,"It's hard for me to believe that... I still have living relatives in this world. If he has any difficulties with his training, I am more than willing to help enlighten him. However, he will need to meet me alone in the mountains. Their family is too... sociable. I wouldn't know how to turn down their invitations without being impolite."
Shenhe,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"I've seen him lean over to you and whisper things in your ear. If he dares threaten you, I will make sure he... Hmm? You mean it's just an in-joke between friends? Genuinely...?"
Shenhe,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"That gentleman claims to be a mortal, yet is very familiar with my master, who is an adeptus. Master once said: ""If you see him drinking on a stone stool in front of my abode, do not disturb him. Let him sit quietly for a while."" And that's precisely what I did."
Shenhe,About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4,"The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake."
Shenhe,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"I often see her wandering in the woods singing strange songs. Actually, I must have heard all of her songs several times each by now. I'm used to her singing, but I still find it strange. That being said, I don't hate it either."
Shenhe,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"My first impression of him was that he's not one to smile. After meeting him again more recently, however, he's still as reserved as ever, but... he seems a lot more relaxed now. Maybe he... met someone special."
Shenhe,More About Shenhe: I,"Please don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. I am not an adeptus, and don't possess any divine abilities. I was born in a branch family of a clan of exorcists, and grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor. I am but an adeptus's disciple, nothing more, nothing less."
Shenhe,More About Shenhe: II Friendship Lv. 3,"When faced with delinquents who are just out to cause trouble, most people will try to reason with them. This course of action perplexes me. Removing the root of the problem and disposing of these ill-intentioned fools seems like the obvious course of action. Why do common folks prefer the labor-intensive route?"
Shenhe,More About Shenhe: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I am the apprentice of multiple adepti and have trained alongside them. After a certain point, however, they stopped teaching me new techniques and started focusing on how to control my intense homicidal urges. Oh, don't be nervous... Yes, craters have been left in the ground, and giant trees have been uprooted. But these things only ever happen in the mountains, far away from civilization, and certainly have never affected innocent lives. Besides, I can control myself now."
Shenhe,More About Shenhe: IV Friendship Lv. 5 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"My father's intent was to trade my flesh and blood for my mother's life. After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?"
Shenhe,More About Shenhe: V Friendship Lv. 6 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"Once, I secretly left the mountain and returned to my childhood village without telling my master. But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you."
Shenhe,Shenhe's Hobbies,"The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on."
Shenhe,Shenhe's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto."
Shenhe,Favorite Food,"I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?"
Shenhe,Least Favorite Food,"Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... ""The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please""... These are the exact words my master said."
Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm, this taste... Is it really meant for me?"
Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: II,The food you cook is indisputably delicious. I can't refuse it.
Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: III,"No matter. I'm used to this kind of flavor, after all."
Shenhe,Birthday,"I've been told that birthdays are important occasions for most people. They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday... Hope you like it."
Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,The power I harness... It grows stronger.
Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"If my master were to learn about this, she'd probably have me add some more red ropes..."
Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I haven't been training as single-mindedly lately, and yet it's as if I'm growing stronger and stronger without making a conscious effort... I'm left to assume the only way for me to achieve this is by your side."
Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I once believed that freeing my mind from all agitation was the only way to overcome. But after everything I've experienced recently, I finally understand... Only when the right things weigh on your mind can the desire to protect awaken inside of you. And that turns your power into something... meaningful."
Shikanoin Heizou,Hello...,"The name's Shikanoin Heizou, sharpest and most successful detective of the Tenryou Commission... Ooh, my goodness, life's really put you through the wringer recently, hasn't it? I can tell. Here, why don't you take a seat, tell me the whole story."
Shikanoin Heizou,Chat: Criminal Cases,There's something in the air... something that tells me a new case is brewing.
Shikanoin Heizou,Chat: Detective Work,Doing detective work means you gotta walk the walk. No... I mean literally — I need to search high and low for evidence.
Shikanoin Heizou,Chat: Intuition,"Huh, my intuition tells me that something very interesting is about to happen..."
Shikanoin Heizou,After the Rain,Let's just hope the rain hasn't washed all the clues away.
Shikanoin Heizou,When Thunder Strikes...,Hmm... I wonder which criminal mastermind just protested their innocence in court... A liar by the sounds of it. Hehe.
Shikanoin Heizou,When It Snows,"Have you ever heard of the case of the vengeful spirit of Dragonspine? It all happened on a dark, snowy night long ago..."
Shikanoin Heizou,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Heh, it's gonna take a little more wind than that to form a cyclone!"
Shikanoin Heizou,Good Morning,"Morning. Oh my, you don't look so good. You didn't have a nightmare, did you? *sigh* I should've known not to expose you to such a shocking case so soon."
Shikanoin Heizou,Good Afternoon,"Alright. Now that lunch is over, whaddya say we play a game to keep our minds sharp? Relay Stones? Hehe... okay, I guess we can warm up with that."
Shikanoin Heizou,Good Evening,"Once the sun has clocked out for the day, it's up to the stars to keep criminals under their watchful gaze."
Shikanoin Heizou,Good Night,"Great, it's time to hit the hay! I wonder what dreams await me tonight?"
Shikanoin Heizou,About Shikanoin Heizou: Detective,"A detective should be using their smarts to crush criminals' hopes of getting away with their crimes. So really, a true detective should never even have to touch their weapon."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Shikanoin Heizou: Keywords Friendship Lv. 4,"I've made it a habit of mine to remember everything I observe in the form of keywords. They're a big help to me when I'm trying to make deductions. Take this person for example: we've got ""cat hair on clean trousers,"" and ""scratch on the wrist."" Looks like they have a soft spot for animals, but they can't get cats to reciprocate... Meanwhile, that one seems very troubled about their ""injured hand,"" and they're wearing a pair of ""brand-new shoes that don't match their well-worn attire""... Hold on, it looks like I might have a new case on my hands here!"
Shikanoin Heizou,About Us: Commissions,"Seems to me like these commissions of yours are an endless gold mine of cases, and you'll never be able to finish them all. So maybe you could throw one my way every once in a while? Not the ones that involve fighting, running errands, or searching for lost items — as you know, not my style. I only take on big, important cases with lots of mysteries to solve... So, keep an eye out for me, yeah? Hehe."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Us: Destined Outcome,"""Coincidence"" is a nice word. It makes things sound like they were meant to be. Unfortunately, as a detective, I don't believe in coincidences. The two of us meeting each other is really the culmination of every choice and move we've made up to this point. So what I'm saying is... our destiny is something we choose."
Shikanoin Heizou,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh? So there are rumors that I can overpower my Tenryou colleagues without even using my Vision? Hehe, well, let me set the record straight. One: Although I am technically a Doushin, I'm strictly a detective. My mind is my greatest tool, not my muscles. Two: It's not like my colleagues and I are getting into fights with each other all the time. And three... *sigh* Alright, seems like there's no fooling you. Just... never mind then, okay?"
Shikanoin Heizou,Something to Share: Sense of Achievement,"As you piece together the trail of clues, it brings you closer and closer to the culprit... and then, that moment when you finally put the last piece of the puzzle into place... I always get such a sense of accomplishment. It's exhilarating!"
Shikanoin Heizou,Something to Share: Doushin,"Not only does being a Doushin come with a certain amount of prestige, it also puts me closer to the action on some of the toughest cases, so the position has definitely broadened my horizons compared to when I was at the detective agency. As for the other duties — patrolling, apprehending criminals, and so on — obviously, I leave that to the more... qualified individuals. There's a limit to how much a single detective can do, you know."
Shikanoin Heizou,Interesting Things,"Question, Traveler, how much do you know about timber? That's right, I'm talking about wood from any ordinary tree you might find along the roadside. Whether a criminal bumps into the bark, disturbs a pile of sawdust, or treads on some leaves, the chances are, they're always gonna leave a trace somehow. Add to that some knowledge of which trees grow in what areas, and if you're lucky, you can infer some crucial details. So, you know: trees. They're a sleuth's best friend."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Madam Kujou Sara? Yeah, that lady's gotta be the most serious person in the entire Tenryou Commission. It would be nice if she could cut us a little slack and give everyone some breathing room — and she's always on my case about my occasional unexplained absences, but what can I say... I just go wherever the evidence leads me."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"I've done a few favors before to deliver Roasted Lavender Melon to him in prison. This one time, I overheard him singing. The lyrics... were complete trash, but I gotta say — he has a pretty good set of pipes. And it's not every day you come across an inmate who's in the mood to sing their heart out."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"The Arataki Gang is a free and diverse organization that accepts anyone, regardless of their background. Pretty amazing if you ask me. They're lucky to have Shinobu to help keep them all in line. Hmm? How do I know all this? Haha, I mean... as deductions go, this one was pretty elementary."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Come to think of it, Lady Guuji's publishing house also publishes murder mysteries, right? So... when can you introduce me? In this day and age, becoming a famous detective requires more than just ability — you need publicity, too. Huh? C'mon, I'm being serious here!"
Shikanoin Heizou,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Things in Common Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, Kazuha? Yeah, he's a solid guy. With his help, I felt like a locked treasure chest of clues had been bust wide open and emptied all over the ground for me to see. If only I had his sensitivity to the natural world... Oh, I get it now! The wind to him must be like my intuition to me!"
Shikanoin Heizou,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Invitation Friendship Lv. 4,"Ohh... It's such a pity! Since the Vision Hunt Decree's been repealed, I no longer have any grounds to officially arrest him. But then again... I guess now, I can just openly invite him to come to the Tenryou Commission and discuss cases with me."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,"General Gorou's constant suspicion made my trip to Watatsumi Island much more eventful... Everywhere I went, there were soldiers keeping me under close surveillance. Honestly, I was a regular, boring tourist just like everybody else. So what if I happen to be a detective in my day job? I was clearly minding my own business there."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4,"I've actually never seen Madam Sangonomiya before. Whenever she appears, practically the whole village crowds around her... I'm not about to contend with that. Oh, and even if you made it through all the villagers, there'd still be a circle of shrine maidens around her! For one of us young people to gain that kind of recognition from everyone, it must have taken a lot of work."
Shikanoin Heizou,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4,I'm barely acquainted with the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I'm glad that I'm not from some sort of prestigious family like that... it's definitely not the kind of life for me.
Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: I,"Even when someone chooses to remain absolutely silent, you can still learn a lot about them just by observing their clothes, posture, and facial expressions. Now, if this conversation ended here... what could you gather from my appearance alone?"
Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Once, when I was sitting in on a criminal trial, I suddenly realized I'd cracked the case. So I interrupted the court just as they were about to declare the verdict. If my objection had turned out to be invalid, then that moment wouldn't have been the turning point that saw me become a detective. Instead, it would have been... ""Shikanoin Heizou, I hereby find you in contempt of court and order your immediate detention!"" Hahaha!"
Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Investigating extramarital affairs, tracking down runaway pets... Those are pretty much the only cases you'll find at a detective agency. I personally need cases of a higher caliber... so, obviously, my only option was to jump ship and join the Tenryou Commission. Another factor was that Sango and I didn't quite see eye to eye in a lot of areas... Just one of those things, I guess."
Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"When I first joined the Tenryou Commission, I started honing my craft by reviewing some cold cases. Before I knew it, ""Mt. Coldcase"" had been completely leveled... It is a pity, these days I no longer have the time to go back and look through old files. I'm forever being brought in to help out on the toughest cases, and I barely have a moment to catch my breath between jobs... Well, what can you do. Once you're a detective of this caliber, the cases come to you."
Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: V Friendship Lv. 6,"By the time a detective is facing a criminal, they have in some sense already failed. Whatever you might do to establish the truth and identify the culprit, you'll never be able to undo the damage caused by the crime. That's why I want my reputation to spread. I want to be a famous detective that makes would-be criminals quake in their boots and quit while they're ahead! In other words, I want to nip crime in the bud. Well, now that you've heard my spiel, why don't you lend me a hand?"
Shikanoin Heizou,Shikanoin Heizou's Hobbies,"Would you like to sit in on a court trial at the Tenryou Commission some time? It's like watching the truth slowly emerge as a collage of facts is pieced together... I can save you a really good seat, but we'll have to pretend like we don't know each other... You know, just pretend."
Shikanoin Heizou,Shikanoin Heizou's Troubles,"There are always those people who resort to violence at the very last second, as if that'll somehow solve their problems. It's a real bummer. Victory for me is to see the look on the defendant's face as they finally confess to their crime in the face of my ironclad evidence and watertight deductions... The moment a detective has to use brute force, they've already lost."
Shikanoin Heizou,Favorite Food,"Name me one item of food that doesn't taste better deep-fried. You can't, right? Whether it's meat or veggies, as long as it's been pulled out of the fryer, I'll love it! I don't think anyone with an empty stomach can resist the smell of fried food."
Shikanoin Heizou,Least Favorite Food,"I cannot stand dinner at the Police Station. It's always the same regimented meals, and don't even get me started on the taste. When it comes to food, you can't enjoy it unless you get to pick exactly what you want, right? But nope, poor me has to make do with slipping out and grabbing a quick bite. *sigh*"
Shikanoin Heizou,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm, I love it! You really outdid yourself this time. Well done!"
Shikanoin Heizou,Receiving a Gift: II,"Would you say cooking is more of a physical or a cognitive task? Hmm, I believe it's both... No wonder you're such a good cook!"
Shikanoin Heizou,Receiving a Gift: III,Hurk! Mmm... let me think. Where did you go wrong here...
Shikanoin Heizou,Birthday,"After I learned that today was your birthday, there was a brief moment when I really wanted to take you to a locked room chock-full of mechanisms and gifts, where you could only get out by solving all the puzzles... Hehe, it's actually really fun! You know, of course I wouldn't do anything like that unless I was sure you'd actually enjoy it. Here, come with me. There's this beautiful scenic spot I've gotta show you before the sun goes down."
Shikanoin Heizou,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"As I get stronger, my intuition gets sharper!"
Shikanoin Heizou,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,It appears my combat abilities are advancing. Too bad it's not all cognitive.
Shikanoin Heizou,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"My, my! At this rate, the name ""Cyclone"" is really gonna stick, isn't it..."
Shikanoin Heizou,Feelings About Ascension - Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Thanks for your trust and support, my dear partner. I couldn't have made it this far without your help. Hmm... I suppose we have time for a quick high five, but then let's get back out there and solve some more mysteries!"
Sucrose,Hello,"I'm Sucrose, a researcher of alchemy. I heard you've been to a lot of places, so I was wondering if you... Ah, what am I saying! It's only our first time meeting, I shouldn't trouble you. But... if you're willing, I'd love to hear any stories you have about your adventures. I'd... really like that."
Sucrose,Chat: Curiosity,What was that? Oh... it's gone. Can I go take a look?
Sucrose,Chat: Organization,I just need a moment to quickly take down some notes.
Sucrose,Chat: Deep Breaths,Ahhh! I haven't been out in a while.
Sucrose,When the Wind Is Blowing,"The windmills are spinning faster than usual today. Hey, do you think if an animal put a propeller on its back and started running... do you think the propeller would make it run faster? Or even, fly?"
Sucrose,When It Snows,"Snow this big only falls a few times a year. If I miss it, I'll have to wait until next year to run my experiments, so please give me some space. Ah-Ahchooo! ...Yes, I know, I should wear more layers..."
Sucrose,When the Sun Is Out,"Th-The sun is already out? Oh, ah, okay! Just one last experiment, and then we can get some rest. Last one, I promise..."
Sucrose,When It Rains,Humidity levels are increasing. Think we could run some tests?
Sucrose,Good Morning,"Good morning. Did you sleep well? According to research, not getting a good night's sleep can have detrimental effects on your cognition and stamina. What? I'm always up working through the night? Yeah, I know... Can't be helped I guess..."
Sucrose,Good Afternoon,"Waaaaa! No, stay back, don't come over here! No, no, it's nothing personal — it's just that this experiment is highly volatile and might cause an explosion."
Sucrose,Good Evening,"Good evening. Please wait a moment. Experiment 905 has actually produced two light excretions, which, for clarity's sake, should be labeled No. 1033 and No. 1035 respectively... Right, now, what did you need me for?"
Sucrose,Good Night,"No need to wait up for me. Please, get some sleep. Something bothering you? Oh, don't worry about me — I'm right at the end of my experiment. I promise I won't stay up late again..."
Sucrose,About Sucrose: Bio-Alchemy,"Bio-alchemy, when compared with creation, places more emphasis on transformation. Finding those little secrets that living creatures have and scaling them up, combining them — the results are always such a surprise. Life really is fascinating. Just how much do we really know?"
Sucrose,About Sucrose: Fear of Strangers,"I... um... really don't know how to act around new people. Everyone's personality is different, as are the things they care about. If I slip up and say the wrong thing, I'll offend someone, or sound impolite... Talking is hard, so much harder than alchemy."
Sucrose,About Sucrose: Ears,"Oh, you, ahh... noticed. My ears are a hereditary feature... quite different from everyone else's. So, I try to hide them with my hair as much as possible."
Sucrose,About Us: Observing,"I'm curious to know about your background. I was wondering... could I perhaps... observe you for a while? I'll be silent, and I won't interfere with what you're doing. Would... that be okay?"
Sucrose,About Us: Perks Friendship Lv. 6,"To be honest, I was a little afraid when we first met, because you don't talk much... I thought I must have offended you somehow. But then as time went on, I discovered you're really easy to get along with. Hehe, just an unexpected outcome of my observations."
Sucrose,About Us: Requests Friendship Lv. 6 The Outlander Who Caught the Wind,"I heard it was you that dealt with the Stormterror issue. No doubt it was a dangerous fight — it's a good thing you came out unscathed. I was ahh... also wondering — did Stormterror happen to drop anything during the fight? You know, a scale, some skin — even just a little would be fine. There are some tests I'd like to run..."
Sucrose,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"My Vision is my most important research tool. Hmm? Why, without it I'd be unable to proceed with most of my elemental research. Combat? Oh, I suppose I use it for that too when I'm out in the field looking for materials."
Sucrose,Something to Share,"This room is where I keep all the bones I've collected. On the table on the left we have lizards, frogs, and grass carp. To the front we have the bones of a wild boar, and then over there in the right corner is a hilichurl... Oh, don't be nervous, nothing to be afraid of. They're really quite cute once you get used to them."
Sucrose,Interesting Things,"If you look closely, you'll notice that the Mist Flowers I've planted here are all different. This one is the most powerful, this one blooms the longest... Hmm? This one? Oh, this one is project 3, version 17, enlargement trial. Its defining trait is that... it's a bit larger."
Sucrose,About Noelle Friendship Lv. 4,"She's... a very willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a little anxious is all. One time, she saw three boxes of materials stacked just outside my laboratory door, and proceeded to move them inside for me. A nice gesture, but the thing is... I'd only just finished putting them outside..."
Sucrose,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Jean has put her into solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection. I told her I'd make her a bouncing, dancing Jumpy Dumpty that is also safe — but to date there are still a lot of problems with the design."
Sucrose,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all — I know that, I do — but... I still find her scary. I don't tend to bother her, and even when I have to... I ask Albedo to go on my behalf."
Sucrose,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"She really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on that which is most core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?"
Sucrose,About Kaeya Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh... I know he likes to joke, and isn't trying to make fun of me, but I often struggle to work out which parts of what he says are the truth and which parts are jokes. So whenever he talks to me, the outcome is usually one of two things: morbid embarrassment or unbearable awkwardness."
Sucrose,About Albedo: Artistry Friendship Lv. 4,"As his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking. No matter how complex the task at hand, his way of thinking ensures he gets to the bottom of it, and is able to explain it thoroughly. His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art."
Sucrose,About Albedo: Talent Friendship Lv. 4,"Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up. But, my studying bio-alchemy has nothing to do with evading his line of research, we just happen to have different interests and dreams — nothing more."
Sucrose,About Amber Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm curious as to why her doll is called ""Baron Bunny,"" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say? Hmm... That's heavily reliant on the rabbit stereotype, is it not? Many rabbits' ears are floppy."
Sucrose,About Fischl Friendship Lv. 4,"I take it you're referring to the book series, Flowers for Princess Fischl? Indeed, the world the author came up with is very creative. If only I could go see it with my own eyes. Oh, you're referring to Fischl herself? I am... doubtful that she could really take me there."
Sucrose,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"The role of a scout is a hazardous one, and Ms. Eula throws herself into danger all too easily. So, I made a reconnaissance device for her, so that she wouldn't have to infiltrate enemy camps herself. But Ms. Eula has such an imposing manner, she really puts me on edge, and... I was so nervous that I accidentally left out a few important details while explaining how to use it... As a result, there was an accident...Ah, what should I do... I hope she won't hold a grudge against me..."
Sucrose,More About Sucrose: I,"You... want to know more about me? You... must have an interest in bio-alchemy, then? Whatever you ask, I will be sure to give you the most precise answer possible. Oh, it really is me specifically that you are interested in? I'm... ahh... oh. I'm at a loss for words."
Sucrose,More About Sucrose: II Friendship Lv. 3,"The essence of research is the process of finding the answer. Sometimes, working through that process can be tedious, but every time I see the cumulative result of my efforts... I know that I'm doing what I love."
Sucrose,More About Sucrose: III Friendship Lv. 4,"When I was little, I had two good friends — we kept nothing from each other. I thought I knew everything about them, but then... stuff happened, and we grew distant. As for where they are now, what they're doing, whether or not they remember me... I have no idea. Even though we were best friends, things still turned out this way."
Sucrose,More About Sucrose: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Let me tell you a little secret, something I've never told anyone. The purpose behind my research is to create my own wonderland. Yes... just like the ones in fairy tales. The kind where all your dreams come true and you live happily ever after. Hehe, it's childish, isn't it? But, I still believe in fairy tales."
Sucrose,More About Sucrose: V Friendship Lv. 6,"If you're busy, please don't let me stand in the way of progress. ...You're not busy? Really? It's fine, I—I get that you have stuff to do. I'm already quite used to working alone. ...You're truly not busy? I—In that case, I don't suppose you could help me with a few things? Or, you know, we could sit and chat about... stuff."
Sucrose,Sucrose's Hobbies,"I like things that look orderly. See? All of my research notes are compiled in notebooks of the exact same thickness. All my potions are lined up according to effect and hue— Wha—What!? What is this purple potion doing here!? Sorry, I—I need to reassess the order of these potions!"
Sucrose,Sucrose's Troubles,"I wonder... What is it that you do in your free time? Every time I get a break, I can never find anything to do. I just find myself staring off into space. Time goes by so quickly when I'm experimenting, so how is it that when I'm not doing anything, the days all feel like years..."
Sucrose,Favorite Food,"I extract the nectar from Sweet Flowers to make candy. When I get stuck in a rut, I just pop one in my mouth and my focus returns. Retaining optimal blood sugar levels during research is essential."
Sucrose,Least Favorite Food,"Once I came to understand more about bio-alchemy, I stopped eating mushrooms. You're no doubt aware? Mushrooms grow on that which has died, which in turn makes me think of other such things, and my appetite just disappears... Blergh..."
Sucrose,Receiving a Gift: I,So delectable! Time to finish my research now that I feel at my best!
Sucrose,Receiving a Gift: II,"I must admit, this tastes a lot better than my healthy meals. Time for me to make some modifications to my diet."
Sucrose,Receiving a Gift: III,"Sorry, I have some... reservations about this dish."
Sucrose,Birthday(Unlocks on the Player's set birthday),"Happy birthday! I've been running experiments for months, and finally I can give you this potion. It will allow you to relive your most beautiful memories of the past year. I call it ""Bio-Potion No. 3916."" Huh? No, no, not 3196, it's 3916!"
Sucrose,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Finally! A breakthrough in my bio-alchemy research.
Sucrose,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"This trip has allowed me to gather a good number of materials. Thank you, I'll be sure to put them to good use."
Sucrose,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Recently during my experiments, I've found myself suddenly wondering when I'll next get to go on an adventure with you. So strange... Why do you think that is? I need to do some scientific investigation to find out."
Sucrose,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,I have such an abundant array of research materials now! To spend any more time on me would... would really be a waste of your time! At least... let me use my bio-alchemy to make you up some kind of gift!
Tartaglia,Hello,"I'm No. 11 of the Fatui Harbingers, codename Childe, but I also go by Tartaglia. And you... Hmm, you too like to cause quite the stir, don't you? Something tells me we're going to get along splendidly."
Tartaglia,Chat: Idleness,"You know, there are better ways to seek out our enemies than... well, standing here."
Tartaglia,Chat: Test of Skills,"This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill."
Tartaglia,Chat: The Fatui,"I wonder what the rest of the Harbingers are up to? Plotting and scheming on an ever-grander scale, no doubt."
Tartaglia,Chat: Snezhnaya,"Where I'm from, if we didn't keep moving, we'd freeze to death. Literally."
Tartaglia,After the Rain,"Ah, perfect weather for fishing! The sound of the rain scares them away, but once it stops, they're yours for the taking."
Tartaglia,When It Snows: Foreign Country,"Haha, ahh... could it be snowing in Snezhnaya too?"
Tartaglia,When It Snows: Snezhnaya,"The world looks glorious in the snow. Pure white, like the light of the moon. A perfect backdrop for bloodshed."
Tartaglia,When It's Windy,The wind is picking up. There is conflict in the air.
Tartaglia,Wind Is Building Up: Foreign Country,Just look at that wind blow!
Tartaglia,Wind Is Building Up: Snezhnaya,"The wind permeates all, cleansing both mind and body. Excellent."
Tartaglia,Good Morning,"Morning, comrade! You're raring to go today, I see."
Tartaglia,Good Afternoon,You look well. What's your secret? Care to exchange notes?
Tartaglia,Good Evening,"Whew, dinner was quite the feast. A spot of exercise is in order."
Tartaglia,Good Night,"Today was great. See you tomorrow, comrade!"
Tartaglia,About Tartaglia,A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant — what matters is that you learn from the experience.
Tartaglia,About Us: Comrades,"Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha..."
Tartaglia,About Us: Weapons Friendship Lv. 6,I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.
Tartaglia,About Us: Survival Friendship Lv. 6,You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our own final battle! I won't allow it!
Tartaglia,About Us: Invitation Friendship Lv. 6,"Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Eleven and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.(Actual Voice-Over: Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could go head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.)"
Tartaglia,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up."
Tartaglia,Something to Share,The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.
Tartaglia,Interesting Things,"I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face to face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!"
Tartaglia,About Skirk Friendship Lv. 4,"It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me..."
Tartaglia,About Zhongli: Pondering Friendship Lv. 4,"There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think."
Tartaglia,About Zhongli: Challenge Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to ""mortal"" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha..."
Tartaglia,About Tsaritsa Friendship Lv. 4,"Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you."
Tartaglia,About Varka Friendship Lv. 4,"Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world."
Tartaglia,About The Jester Friendship Lv. 4,"He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else."
Tartaglia,About The Captain Friendship Lv. 4,"I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of."
Tartaglia,About The Doctor Friendship Lv. 4,"I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive."
Tartaglia,About Damselette Friendship Lv. 4,"The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her."
Tartaglia,About The Knave Friendship Lv. 4,"Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas — I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body."
Tartaglia,About The Rooster Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family."
Tartaglia,About Marionette Friendship Lv. 4,"She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her? Anyway, I've only met her a few times, but every time she looked like she wanted to murder me. I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though."
Tartaglia,About Regrator Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, now that guy has a head full of grandiose plans fueled by raw ambition. I don't understand a word he says once he starts talking about his theories... Eh, but as long as he keeps our cash reserves stocked up, I'm not complaining."
Tartaglia,About The Fair Lady Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"I never got along with her, you know that. I guess there's not much more worth saying about her at this point. When you're a harbinger, you have to accept that death could come at any time... But don't worry about me. No matter what happens, I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself alive."
Tartaglia,About The Balladeer Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"After he took the Gnosis, we lost all contact with him. Now comes the task of trying to hunt it down and get it back... I actually don't mind it — it means I get to travel all over. Wonder if I'll run into you somewhere along the way?"
Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: I,"Remember, comrade, one day I will conquer the world!"
Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along."
Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: III Friendship Lv. 4,"However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings are well... And I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors too.(Actual Voice-Over: However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings... I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors as well.)"
Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, ""I'm on fire!"" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs."
Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive, haha."
Tartaglia,Tartaglia's Hobbies,Ice fishing and combat follow the same principle. Patience and decisiveness are key. Though having said that... I suppose the same is true of everything in life.
Tartaglia,Tartaglia's Troubles,"My pet peeves? Hmm, well, to be honest, I'm far too busy journeying with you and slaying powerful enemies to dwell on such trifling matters."
Tartaglia,Favorite Food,There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world... and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well. Life is beautiful.
Tartaglia,Least Favorite Food,"Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you."
Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: I,"Eating delicious food really has a way of taking all your cares away. Now, how should I repay you?"
Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: II,"Your cooking skills seem to have improved quite a lot. Does that mean you're getting stronger all the time, too?"
Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: III,"Um, I'll admit the taste surprises me a little. Hmm? Okay... I'll try one more bite."
Tartaglia,Birthday,"Happy birthday, comrade! Anyone you need knocked off their perch today? Let me know. I'll happily oblige..."
Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Ho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig..."
Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"""A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it."" Hmm, who was it that said this again?"
Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Bravo, comrade! Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far."
Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Comrade. Make sure you keep training too. Otherwise, who will be left to fight me to the death when the world lies defeated at my feet?"
Thoma,Hello,"It's good to meet you at last, Traveler. I've been hearing about you for a long time now. I'm your new buddy, Thoma — as long as that's okay with you, of course!"
Thoma,Chat: Thoma's Treat,"Hey... how about we go for a nice meal some time? My treat, of course."
Thoma,Chat: Concern,"I feel like there's something I forgot to do... hmm, I tidied the courtyard, put the tea on... Eh, it's probably just my mind playing tricks on me."
Thoma,Chat: Mora,"I really did spend a lot recently, only 10 Mora left... Still, 10 Mora's better than no Mora!"
Thoma,When It Rains,"Where'd this rain come from? Are you gonna be okay? Here, I'll lend you my coat..."
Thoma,When Thunder Strikes,You don't wanna be out in open country in this kind of weather. You'll get struck by lightning for sure.
Thoma,When It Snows,"Don't run on the ice... 'cause if you fall down, I won't help you up, you gotta learn somehow."
Thoma,When the Sun Is Out,Lovely weather we're having! Will you join me for a walk?
Thoma,Good Morning,"Morning! If you're free, why not come with me to the market? The vegetables are freshest earlier in the day."
Thoma,Good Afternoon,"On the lunch menu today, we have Sakura Tempura and Tricolor Dango! Here, there's some for you, some for Paimon, and I also put some aside for milady and the man of the clan himself. Ah, wait, I forgot someone... There's none for me..."
Thoma,Good Evening,"Come quick, we gotta get down to the market — they slash the prices on fish around this time of day. Oh, and if you find something that you just can't do without, I'll help you haggle the price down."
Thoma,Good Night,"Okay, good night. You had a busy day today, you should get some rest, too. Don't stay up late."
Thoma,About Thoma: Housekeeper,"It was never Ayaka or Ayato's intention to make me the housekeeper, I volunteered. I like this kind of work. Putting everything in order gives me a great sense of achievement, and based on everyone's reactions... Yeah, I think I do a pretty good job."
Thoma,About Thoma: Meaning Friendship Lv. 4,"For me, housework is about keeping a space clean and tidy, so that everyone who lives there has a smile on their face. And now... it looks like I'm responsible for another smile. I'll do my best to deliver!"
Thoma,About Us: Eating Alone,"Hey, how come you're eating here all alone? ...Uh, is it okay if I join you? Or did you just want some space?"
Thoma,"About Us: Oath Friendship Lv. 6 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","If you hadn't put yourself out there during the Vision Hunt Ceremony and taken on the Raiden Shogun all by yourself, I would've lost my Vision, and with it all my aspirations. I've been thinking about this a lot, and it seems there's only one way I could ever properly repay you...I, Thoma, give to you my weapon and my loyalty, and I promise to fight for you, no matter what."
Thoma,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,Those that receive Visions should look after them. I certainly don't plan on losing mine.
Thoma,Something to Share,"I've gotten to know all kinds of people over the years, and I'd say that Inazumans are more particular about etiquette than Mondstadters. If you make sure you're always polite to people, it's much easier to get things done."
Thoma,Interesting Things: Tanuki,"I've always wanted to see a tanuki shapeshifting. They say it can change into all kinds of things, and that it likes to play pranks on passersby. It's a creature with a sense of humor, that's for sure."
Thoma,Interesting Things: Animals,"Are you an animal person, too? If you are, let me take you to the outskirts some time, it's great. I just need to give a whistle, and all these puppies and kittens will come out of nowhere and start strutting around your ankles, clamoring for your affection. Haha, just imagining it is already brightening my day."
Thoma,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Lady Miko? Wh—What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N—Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha..."
Thoma,About the Raiden Shogun: Comparison Friendship Lv. 4,"In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear."
Thoma,"About the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach."
Thoma,"About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","The captain of The Crux — a formidable woman indeed. She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer..."
Thoma,About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4,"As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home."
Thoma,"About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4 Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow","Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little."
Thoma,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4,"Of Naganohara Fireworks fame? She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks. Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note — here, have a coupon!"
Thoma,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?"
Thoma,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her."
Thoma,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm... Word on the street is that he's quite a character — apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!"
Thoma,About Shikanoin Heizou Friendship Lv. 4,"Ho, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth."
Thoma,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct... Oh, just the ""Acting"" Grand Master? Haha, well, someone of her standing won't care about titles."
Thoma,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet. You're better off steering clear of them if you can help it. Ah, now I'm in a Mondstadt mood again... The memories."
Thoma,More About Thoma: I,"Anything I can lend a hand with? If something needs doing around the house or you're having some interpersonal strife, just say the word. Hmm? A conversation... I see, I see. That's a little different from what I'm used to, but I'm all for it."
Thoma,More About Thoma: II Friendship Lv. 3,"I'm not from Inazuma originally — I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying."
Thoma,More About Thoma: III Friendship Lv. 4,"I get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders."
Thoma,More About Thoma: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me."
Thoma,More About Thoma: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?"
Thoma,Thoma's Hobbies,"I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating. Before that, I was really into ninjutsu for a while, and before that... Hmm? You think I'm not dedicated enough? N—No! It's not like that, you got me all wrong!"
Thoma,Thoma's Troubles,"I'm in a real pickle here. The chief is hosting a banquet for his friends tonight, and he says he wants me to splurge a little by cooking some Butter Crab. The only problem is that for the last two days, I haven't been able to buy crab anywhere! So, what, am I gonna have to dive into the ocean and grab them myself?"
Thoma,Favorite Food,"Without a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time."
Thoma,Least Favorite Food,"As far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing."
Thoma,Receiving a Gift: I,Delicious! Could I get another bowl of rice?
Thoma,Receiving a Gift: II,"Um, are you free right now? Would you mind sharing some of your cooking tips with me?"
Thoma,Receiving a Gift: III,"I don't think I've ever tasted anything like this... Oh, it's not too bad, though."
Thoma,Birthday,"Quick, come with me! I remembered it's your birthday, obviously, so I thought I'd throw you a proper party. There's food, there's drinks, and I invited a whole bunch of your friends, too. Hey, this is your birthday we're talking about! I wasn't about to let you spend it all alone!"
Thoma,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Really? This'll make me stronger? You'd better not be kidding, I have stacks of laundry to do."
Thoma,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,It feels like... a fire inside of me has just begun to burn.
Thoma,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I have all of this power, but how should I use it? I need to give this one some serious thought."
Thoma,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Thank you for placing your trust in me. Your kindness warms my heart more than the brightest flame ever could. But not to worry, I've figured out what I want to do now. My strength is your shield, and I will always be here to protect you."
Tighnari,Hello,"Hi there. I'm Tighnari, Forest Watcher of the Avidya Forest. My duty is to preserve both the rainforest's ecosystem and the safety of its visitors.

Tighnari,When It Rains,"I'm used to the rain, but you should probably use an umbrella."
Tighnari,After the Rain,I applied a plant-based waterproofing oil to my tail. One swish and it's dry.
Tighnari,When Thunder Strikes,"Ah, the thunder's so loud! Ugh... My head hurts..."
Tighnari,When It Snows,"I don't see weather like this very often! Oh, are you cold? If you want, you can tuck your hands into my tail."
Tighnari,When the Wind Is Blowing,My ears... My ears... They're going to be blown inside out!
Tighnari,In the Desert,"Gah, it's so hot... Even a Mist Flower would melt in this heat... Ah, now that I think about it, it wouldn't... but you get what I mean, hehe... Ugh..."
Tighnari,Good Morning,Listen! That's the sound of dew dripping upon the leaves.
Tighnari,Good Afternoon,"During lunch breaks, I like to sit in a tree and admire the sunlight streaming through the canopy. If I'm not careful, I'll fall asleep..."
Tighnari,Good Evening,Good evening. I'm preparing to go observe bioluminescent flora. Want to come?
Tighnari,Good Night,Get some sleep. I'll be on guard duty — it'll be a good time to write today's patrol log entry.
Tighnari,About Tighnari: Profession,"I studied botany in the Amurta Darshan. My academic adviser wanted me to join the faculty after graduation, but to be quite honest, I prefer a somewhat freer research environment. From my observations, the way that the Akademiya handles certain matters leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, my adviser didn't push the issue — heh, not like that would've worked."
Tighnari,About Tighnari: Kin,"Many people think that my kind are loners, and I don't blame them for thinking that. The few of us around are mostly scholars, and we're always chasing our research — so you'd be lucky to spy a single tuft of tail fur in a whole year. Like my father, for example. He's an entomologist, and lately, he's been studying the evolution of beetles in the desert... I have no intention of joining him. I'm ashamed to admit that I don't tolerate the sun very well. Prolonged exposure turns my brain and body into mush."
Tighnari,About Us: Getting Along,I believe that the best way to achieve mutual understanding with someone is to spend time with them. Other methods are less realistic. That's why there is no need to rush introductions. Time will settle everything.
Tighnari,About Us: Friends Friendship Lv. 6,"""Are we officially friends?"" What, so this sort of thing needs official documentation now? Okay then... Well, hand over your ""friendship certificate."" I assume it'll need my signature."
Tighnari,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"I remember praying as a kid that if I were lucky enough to receive a Vision, it had to be a Dendro one. It wasn't because of research. I just wanted to make a vine ladder to reach high-hanging fruit."
Tighnari,Something to Share: Aranara,"I've heard about the Aranara for some time now, but I haven't personally seen any. Sometimes, I hear rustling sounds from the forest's depths, but they disappear when I go closer. That's a good thing, though. At least they know how to protect themselves, unlike those stupid adventurers whose first thought when they run into an Avidya Leopard is ""Ooh, maybe I'll form an inter-species friendship today."
Tighnari,Something to Share: Karkata Friendship Lv. 4 The Unanswerable Problems,"Don't worry about Karkata. I told the Matra I know that it's my research assistant. If anyone wants to do anything to it, they'll need to go through me. ...Since you seem to care a lot about Karkata, why don't you enroll in some courses at the Spantamad Darshan? That way, you can care for it even if I'm gone."
Tighnari,Interesting Things,"Did you know that plants can camouflage themselves? Some mimic insects or birds to intimidate their natural predators, others produce bait to attract pollinators, and still others are obligate carnivores that utilize enticing fragrances or honey to lure in their prey... Hmm, I feel like I'm not just talking about plants anymore."
Tighnari,About Collei Friendship Lv. 4,"When that child was first brought here, she was effectively illiterate. It wasn't a huge issue, though. She's a hard worker and a diligent student, so she's made good progress. Still, her goal is to learn advanced medical techniques, so she still has a long way to go. She sometimes puts too much pressure on herself... Help her out when you can, would you? Consider it a favor for me as her mentor. Thanks a lot."
Tighnari,About Cyno: General Mahamatra Friendship Lv. 4,"You want to see Cyno...? Well, firstly, a word of caution: if he ever comes chasing you down for work-related reasons, prepare for the nightmare of a lifetime. Other than that, General Mahamatra is a high-ranking position, so it usually isn't easy to find him. But he does occasionally go to Gandharva Ville to see Collei. As much as he might want to stay unnoticed, he can't fool my ears, heh."
Tighnari,"About Cyno: Good Question Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","After my adviser's rescue, I wrote him a letter to send my regards. To my surprise, he wrote back saying that someone had already given him my regards in person. He ended the letter with a query ""Why is the General Mahamatra saying he wants to leverage the full might of Sumeru to restore the reputation of sages?"" ...Good question. I'd like to know, too."
Tighnari,About Alhaitham Friendship Lv. 4,"Be careful of Alhaitham. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he purely operates by rationality, so people often find his actions unacceptable. If you don't believe me, just ask his housemate — thanks to Alhaitham, he has more pent-up frustration than an angry Anemo Slime."
Tighnari,About Kaveh Friendship Lv. 4,"Kaveh is a famous architect in Sumeru. The Palace of Alcazarzaray is his magnum opus. During the initial planning, he even asked me to recommend suitable ornamental flora. I don't know why or how, but he ended up heavily in debt after the palace was completed. Alhaitham is helping out by letting him stay at his place, but... I don't know whether that's a blessing or a curse..."
Tighnari,About Dori Friendship Lv. 4,"The renowned Lord Sangemah Bay is none other than Dori. I became acquainted with her through a previous research project. It had required very rare materials, and the only way I could get them was through her and her mysterious supply network. Uh... never you mind what I was buying and what I was researching, thank you very much!"
Tighnari,"About Layla Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","I've heard of her, the famous ""Sleepwalking Eccentric."" The rumors about her sleepwalking are really quite absurd: feats of superhuman strength, sprinting through Aaru Village at night, scaling the Wall of Samiel with her bare hands... Some even say that she can write a 100,000-word thesis while asleep! What a load of nonsense."
Tighnari,About Lisa Friendship Lv. 4,"Cyno has mentioned her before — an extraordinary genius with a veritable wealth of knowledge and talent. A pity that she returned to Mondstadt so long ago. Perhaps, in the course of her studies, she witnessed the horrifying side of knowledge..."
Tighnari,About Lesser Lord Kusanali Friendship Lv. 4,"As a student, I once heard this saying: ""Plants and the Land of Dendro share the same history."" It could just be one of those things that people say, but I've always felt that there's a deeper meaning to those words... If I meet Lesser Lord Kusanali one day, I wonder... if she would explain them to me?"
Tighnari,"About Dehya Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","Everything happened so fast, and I didn't get the chance to properly thank her. To have a capable and reliable person like her on your side is extremely fortunate. I'm sure she must have many groups trying to persuade her to join their ranks. But she definitely doesn't strike me as the kind of person who would be interested in joining the Akademiya or the Forest Rangers, so I'll spare myself the inevitable rejection."
Tighnari,More About Tighnari: I,"Are you acclimating to the rainforest? I suggest that you keep your eyes and ears open. Take care of yourself, and if anything happens, just flag down a Forest Ranger."
Tighnari,More About Tighnari: II Friendship Lv. 3,"*sigh* Sometimes I really do envy those simpletons who go around touching and eating anything and everything. In their minds, it must feel like miracles happen every day."
Tighnari,More About Tighnari: III Friendship Lv. 4,"To better serve the Avidya Forest, I occasionally offer training courses to the Forest Rangers. If you want to split hairs, then yes, these courses would be considered as ""dissemination of information"" by the Akademiya. But what are they going to do — lock me up? I dare them. We'll see how many patients suffering from weird and wonderful ailments start flooding into the Bimarstan every day!"
Tighnari,More About Tighnari: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I'll let you in on a secret: I actually really like the atmosphere in the Grand Bazaar. Business is booming, everyone's so lively, and the theater is full of song and dance. Unfortunately, my ears don't tolerate loud sounds very well... You'll cover my ears for me? Hahaha, it'd be way too hard to walk like that! Thanks for the thought, though."
Tighnari,More About Tighnari: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I had many beautiful and fantastical dreams as a child, but they vanished from my memory one day after I grew up. Do you still have dreams? Tell me about them."
Tighnari,Tighnari's Hobbies,"Leaves and flowers often drop onto the ground of the Avidya Forest, sometimes perfectly intact. Leaving them on the ground would be such a pity... I can't help but pick them up and keep them as biological specimens. They can be used as educational materials for Forest Rangers or as decorative pieces. Very versatile."
Tighnari,Tighnari's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"Troubles? Let me think... Pollution in the Avidya Forest, adventurers who constantly stir up trouble, and rescue dogs that always want to mess with my tail... But these problems all have solutions. If you're talking about bigger concerns, then I really don't have any. In this regard, the life of a Forest Watcher is pretty simple."
Tighnari,Favorite Food,"This may sound strange, but although the blood of a carnivore runs through my veins, mushrooms are the one food that I can't give up. There are many species of edible mushrooms. Whether fresh or dried, they all give off a unique scent. Even when stewed with meat, it's the mushrooms' aroma that comes out on top."
Tighnari,Least Favorite Food,"My olfactory system is overly sensitive, so I lack the good fortune to enjoy heavily spiced foods... Quite the shame in Sumeru."
Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: I,Excellent ingredients and impeccable seasoning. In short — it's delicious.
Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: II,Nice flavor pairing. Could you give me a copy of the recipe? I want to put this on the menu for the Forest Rangers' next meal.
Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: III,...Do I need to teach you some new recipes?
Tighnari,Birthday,"Happy birthday! I picked out a potted plant in full bloom for you, along with a gardening guide. If anything happens to it, don't hesitate to find me at any time. This plant comes with a Forest Watcher lifetime guarantee.I'll have you know a lot of flowers are in season on your birthday. It took me forever to choose one. I'll get you a different species next year!"
Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,Germinating seeds break through the soil and take root.
Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Seedlings grow, reaching out with their branches and leaves."
Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 3,Branches dotted with flower buds herald the advent of spring.
Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 4,A rich harvest that will lead to even richer ones.
Venti,Hello,"*Yawn* That was a refreshing sleep. Ah, Traveler, we meet again! What? You don't remember me? Ahaha, well, allow me to join you on your quest once again. I must see to it that the bards of the world tell the Traveler's tales!"
Venti,Chat: Playing the Lyre,"Sure, I'll play you another tune, but it'll cost you an apple."
Venti,Chat: Apple Cider,"Right now I wish I was sat at the top of a tree, looking out over a meadow, cider in hand... *sigh*"
Venti,Chat: Ballads,"Come on Traveler, let's go! The world is full of lost ballads just waiting to be rediscovered."

Venti,When the Wind Is Blowing,"The wind has returned! Quick, let's go gliding!"
Venti,Good Morning,Morning! What's in store for today?

Venti,Good Evening,"I'm still not sleepy, fancy an evening stroll?"
Venti,Good Night,"Off to the land of nod? Haha, Farewell my friend!"
Venti,About Venti,Practice? Me? There's no need - I already know every song in Teyvat!
Venti,About Us: New Songs,"I have decided to write a song about you! What are you giving me that look for? Can't afford it? Don't be preposterous, the price for you, my friend, is precisely zero Mora! Although... one thing you could do is tell me a few more of your stories!"
Venti,About Us: Heroes Friendship Lv. 6,"Haha, once the (hero/heroine) in the song has actually rescued the (princess/prince), I will ensure this song spreads to every corner of the continent!"
Venti,About Us: Apostles Friendship Lv. 6 Song of the Dragon and Freedom,"An evening breeze really sets the mood for becoming my disciple, don't you think? We can do it right now, you just need to make me a small offering..."
Venti,About Us: Requests Friendship Lv. 6 Song of the Dragon and Freedom,"What's that? You think I should try harder to be a good Anemo Archon? Well you could be a better devotee too... you could be more pious, more passionate, or... um..."
Venti,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm? You want to know about my Vision? Oh, go on then, take a look for yourself. I can make you a matching one if you like! Hehehe."
Venti,Something to Share,"Olah! Haha, that's how the Hilichurls say ""hello"". Why, I learned it to aid with my songwriting, of course! Vast knowledge makes for a richer composition... That said, I haven't actually written any songs in Hilichurlian so far..."
Venti,Interesting Things,"Traveler, have you ever seen a cecilia? It's a magnificent white wildflower that only grows on the most remote mountains and clifftops. To me, at least, it is the most beautiful flower in all of Teyvat."
Venti,About Jean Friendship Lv. 4,"Acting Grand Master Jean... Well, what do you think of her? Yes, I couldn't agree more: conscientious, courageous... kind and considerate too. Reminds me of another good friend..."
Venti,About Diluc Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm not surprised you want to befriend Master Diluc, just think of all vintage wine he must have stored away... Mwuhahaha... Huh? He doesn't let you sample it? Not even the slightest drop? Huh... Well, I guess you can still appreciate the aroma. That's still better than no wine at all, right? No?"
Venti,About Barbara Friendship Lv. 4,"The darling Deaconess with the sweet singing voice — do you know her? You do? Idol, huh? Meet and greets? Concerts? Wow... That's the power of music for you..."
Venti,About Razor Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yes, the white-haired fellow from Wolvendom? Raised by wolves? Really? ... No wonder his scent is so familiar..."
Venti,About Mona Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, that astrologer? How should I put it? Fortune telling and my singing are the same. Both lead to you being so poor you can't even cough up the money for a drink! ...You think that astrology is a cultural tradition, so at least still has some value? Hmph, so rude. In that case, so too is singing, so it still has its value too!"
Venti,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,"There's a special drink known far and wide at Cat's Tail. But it ah... ahh... ACHOO! *sniffs* How about you go and fetch one for me? I'll be truly thankful, I promise."
Venti,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 4,"How do you explain white chalk in black soil, or the earth's dense crust amidst the emptiness of space? Same reason the purest soil gave birth to human life... It's an ancient power with unmistakable properties. Trying to harness it is dangerous indeed, I can't imagine what would happen if someone lost control of it in the city... Ah, never mind! What goes on within Mondstadt's walls is up to Mondstadt's people to deal with!"
Venti,About Morax Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Have you seen that gentleman around? Huh? He's just a normal man by the name of Zhongli now? That must be quite the change for that old block-head. Come with me to see him, will you? I have a vintage I dug up from Windrise that I can take as a condolence gift. Oh, ahh... did he still seem strong when you saw him? How strong? Am I likely to get blown away?"
Venti,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"Eula has good taste when it comes to beverages of the alcoholic variety. Come summer or winter, she always likes them ice-cold. That's rare among Mondstadters these days! She and I would make great drinking buddies. Huh? My songs about the Lawrence Clan... She's heard them already? Eh, no harm done. Maybe she and I can do a duet sometime!"
Venti,About Baal Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"So, I hear you defeated the mighty Raiden Shogun? Ah, I recall the days when she was a kagemusha, seeking to perfect her martial prowess. Hehe, she now no doubt employs a wide range of reasoning to get you to train with her. Oh but yes, come close and I shall let you in on her weakness — desserts!"
Venti,"About Buer Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","The first thing you think of when you hear ""Dendro Archon"" is her power over dreams. Her dreams are akin to my ballads: full of emotion and imagination. It goes without saying that we get along really well."
Venti,More About Venti: I,"Perfect timing, Traveler! I was about to ask you — what is your greatest wish?"
Venti,More About Venti: II Friendship Lv. 3,"There's never a dull moment traveling with you! The only minor inconvenience is that pesky little pixie thing that follows you everywhere... she never stops eating, I can't begin to imagine how much you spend on food!"
Venti,More About Venti: III Friendship Lv. 4,"The Pyro Archon is a wayward, warmongering wretch, and the Geo Archon is a brutish blundering buffoon! How do I know? Because, this is written in the epic poems of days gone by!"
Venti,More About Venti: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Celestia... I'm not sure even I could fly that far. In any case, the water there tastes foul and the fruit is bland. You know what that means? No cider! Haha, in that case, I wouldn't go there even if I was invited."
Venti,More About Venti: V Friendship Lv. 6,"My greatest wish? It has always been to roam free and experience the whole world. Now I would add that wherever I go, it simply must be with you! Each day with you is an adventure, and where adventurers go, storytellers must follow!"
Venti,Venti's Hobbies,I like to drink! And I like the wind! If only there were such a thing as wind-brewed cider...
Venti,Venti's Troubles,"I'm actually highly allergic to cats, I start sneezing as soon as they enter the vicinity, and... Aaah... Aa-choo! Ugh, apparently I can't even THINK about cats without sneezing. Do you think there is a cure for this monstrous affliction?"
Venti,Favorite Food,"Here, have an apple. I just picked it. Look how ripe and juicy it is... *munching*... Truly the fruit of the gods."
Venti,Least Favorite Food,"What's that tasty morsel you've got there... Eew! A melted cheese pancake! A smelly, sticky, slimy disgusting mess!"
Venti,Receiving a Gift: I,"Ahh, quite delightful! So... could I get the same thing again tomorrow? ...And maybe the day after that?"
Venti,Receiving a Gift: II,"Oof, I'm so full... I'll have to pass on the post-meal fruits this time..."
Venti,Receiving a Gift: III,"I can't believe it, but I don't think I can stomach this... Oh boy... What a predicament."
Venti,Birthday,"Someone once told me you're supposed to eat a cake on your birthday... Tada! Here's your birthday cake — it's apple flavored! And here's a spoon. The cake didn't rise properly in the oven, that's why it looks more akin to an apple pie... Ugh, baking is really quite complicated!"

Venti,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Good work. Shall we repose for a moment, with a tune? Shall it be a capriccio, or a serenade?"
Venti,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Come, sit with me. I've written a new poem. I call it ""Wind of the Traveler."
Venti,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Hmm... Though I've long since viewed this scenery a great many times, there is something different about seeing it again with you. Surely you're not still concealing some other wondrous abilities? Hmm, even if you were, it would simply further prove that my intuition is correct."
Xiangling,Hello,"Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Xiangling, I'm a chef from Liyue! My favorite place is the chicken... I mean, the kitchen! Ugh, I practiced so hard, but I still get nervous when introducing myself... Hee hee."
Xiangling,Chat: Snacks,Is there time for a quick snack? I'll whip one up in no time!
Xiangling,Chat: Pyro Slime,I can't decide whether Pyro slimes taste better with salt and pepper or garlic and herbs?

Xiangling,About Xiangling,You've seen the dragon in Mondstadt? How big was it? What!? No way! Imagine how big a steak a dragon that huge would make!
Xiangling,About Us: Strengths,"I'm much better at cooking than navigating... but if you do go out, definitely take me with you!"
Xiangling,About Us: New Knowledge Friendship Lv. 6,"Meeting you has really opened my eyes to things other than cooking. Like what? Well, such as... um... for example... I can't think when you put me on the spot! Forget it, I'll stick to cooking from now on. I have a new recipe for you to try, actually..."
Xiangling,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Any time, night or day, I am always willing to make dishes everyone loves. I think the Archons agree with my passion, or else they wouldn't have given me this Vision, something even my master doesn't have... I know they want me to keep going!"
Xiangling,Something to Share,"If you get a stomach ache, a cup of herbal tea with Silk Flowers will clear it up in no time! Huh? Of course you can trust my herbal remedies! We chefs are expected to know a thing or two about medicine as well, you know!"

Xiangling,About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4,"I can smell Mist Flowers! It must be Dr. Baizhu! What is he doing here? Uh-- Are you okay? Do you feel faint? Is your stomach sore? Or is it a sore throat? I've got it, you're fatigued from all that adventuring! No?... You're fine? Phew! Otherwise, he would have made you drink some traditional herbal medicine — it's so bitter!"
Xiangling,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!"
Xiangling,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"Is Hu Tao picking on you too? Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph. But I can handle it, and she does bring me fermented plum blossoms once in a while so I can make flower cakes... so I don't hold a grudge."
Xiangling,About Diona Friendship Lv. 4,"Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me — like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine — all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then."
Xiangling,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies. *giggle* Not just Beidou, but everyone on board the Crux loves my cooking."
Xiangling,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: ""It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu."" I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?"
Xiangling,About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4,"Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two."
Xiangling,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her — vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her."
Xiangling,About Yaoyao Friendship Lv. 4,"Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior..."
Xiangling,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,"Xinyan always comes to the Wanmin Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine out of ten times, she enjoys them too! She's great.(Actual Voice-Over: Xinyan always comes to the Wanmin Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great.)"
Xiangling,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilis! Truly amazing."
Xiangling,More About Xiangling: I,"Roasted pigeon skewers, anyone? C'mon, it's my secret recipe, you'll love it!"
Xiangling,More About Xiangling: II Friendship Lv. 3,"My master did a good job teaching me spear fighting, don't you think? If you want, I could teach you too. Although... I'd much rather teach you my cooking, if you're interested! I want my recipes to spread all around Teyvat!"
Xiangling,More About Xiangling: III Friendship Lv. 4,"My heart's desire? To start my very own cooking tradition, of course! Li-style and Yue-style cooking are good, but they have a limited palate. The missing ingredient? Chilli pepper! Come, let me fry up one of Guoba's chilli peppers for you..."
Xiangling,More About Xiangling: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"I think I've won you over with my cooking now, right? It's time to introduce you to my latest masterpiece — I call it ""the most marvelous multi-colored super pancake""! Bright red squirrel ham, orange carrot, yellow sunfrog meat, green calla lily and blue butterfly wings, beautifully wrapped up in a thin egg pancake— What? I thought you said you were starving? *sigh* Okay."
Xiangling,More About Xiangling: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I'm in a dilemma and I don't know how to solve it... It isn't like me to get so worked up over nothing... Ah! Well, here's the thing. I always love getting you to try my latest recipes, but... I'm worried that my food might not agree with your stomach and... I can't bear the thought of that happening. What should I do?"
Xiangling,Xiangling's Hobbies,"Watch carefully! Heat the oil in a pan, then take a handful of crystalflies — wings removed — pop them in, and voila! Delicious deep-fried crystal— Hey! Where are you going?"
Xiangling,Xiangling's Troubles,"It's been a month and I still haven't sold a single bowl of Mushroom Slime Stew. Gee, is it just because it looks sticky and gooey? It's their loss if they don't have a spoonful..."
Xiangling,Favorite Food,"My favorite thing to eat is... whatever exotic ingredient I haven't tried yet! No, I'm not dodging the question, that's my honest answer!"
Xiangling,Least Favorite Food,"I'll eat absolutely anything! There are no bad ingredients, only bad cooking!"
Xiangling,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm! I know this taste, it's... boom shaka-laka!"
Xiangling,Receiving a Gift: II,"I gotta admit, you're really good at cooking. Next time, it's my turn to show you a thing or two."
Xiangling,Receiving a Gift: III,Are you sure you followed the recipe? Something is definitely off here...
Xiangling,Birthday,"Ah, there you are! Come with me, I've prepared a birthday feast all for you! ... No really, I insist! Which dish is your favorite? It's okay, take your time, try them all first, then let me know!"

Xiangling,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"As my father always says: ""To make a five-star dish, you need ten-star passion!"" I know, I know! To be able to come this far is definitely thanks to your ten-star passion when it comes to practicing with me, so I'll be sure to pay you back with two-no, three times the passion!"
Xiao,Hello,"If you awake to a knife at your throat, if monsters dig their claws into you, if death comes knocking at your door, call out my name. Adeptus Xiao. I will be here when you call."

Xiao,About the Vision: Desires Friendship Lv. 3,Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your mortal ideals. I have no desire.
Xiao,About the Vision: Reasons Friendship Lv. 5,Hiding? I'm hiding nothing. I just won't speak of desire to others.Do mortals not have a rule about spoken wishes never coming true? Hm? What do you mean that's not the same?
Xiao,Something to Share,I deal in death. If you cannot bring yourself to kill — speak my name.
Xiao,Interesting Things,"Dihua Islet was once deserted.Though that was many decades... no, centuries ago..."
Xiao,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Can I ask... Zhongli — what does he do with his days? Huh? Birds, antiques, flowers...Hmm... What deeper meaning do they hold?"
Xiao,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Beidou? I have nothing to do with her. Though there is such a thing as the leviathan. As a mere human, she has proven her power in defeating Haishan."
Xiao,About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4,"You want... Baizhu to make a medicine to take away my pain? I understand your intentions, but mortal medicine has no effect on adepti."
Xiao,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"Hu Tao? Her liveliness is irritating. Fortunately, she is also humorous, so you need not worry about her growing into a boring human."

Xiao,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ganyu is neither mortal nor illuminated beast. Wandering both the mortal and Adepti realms with duty as her sole guide, it was inevitable that she would become perplexed... What? Me? You believe a Yaksha who knows nothing more than how to massacre countless souls and emerge unscathed is a suitable mentor for such an individual? ...Your mind occupies a very different world from that which your body inhabits."
Xiao,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"It seems Shenhe places a great deal of trust in you. Well, how could she not. There are few people in the world as kind and good-natured as you."
Xiao,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"I've heard that she once investigated The Chasm, following the trail of the Millelith. If she can investigate mysteries like that on her own, she must be someone of rare skill."

Xiao,More About Xiao: II Friendship Lv. 3,"In the thousands of years that have passed, I have taken countless wraiths. If you want no trouble, stay away from me. See me as a weapon, and nothing more."

Xiao,Xiao's Hobbies,"There's nothing timid about you, having the courage to ask about my hobbies.So, fight me. How long do you think your body will last against my blows?"
Xiao,Xiao's Troubles,Trouble? Ha. Trouble means nothing to adepti. There is no trouble that can last for a thousand years.

Xiao,Favorite Food: Memories,The taste of Almond Tofu feels like a fond dream...

Xiao,Receiving a Gift: II,No need.
Xiao,Receiving a Gift: III,Try something else next time.
Xiao,Birthday,This mortal concept of commemorating the day of your birth really is redundant. Wait. Have this. It's a butterfly I made from leaves.Okay. Take it. It's an adepti amulet — it staves off evil.
Xiao,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,This is it? Nothing worth getting excited about.
Xiao,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,New power? All it will be used for is death.

Xingqiu,Hello,"Xingqiu at your service, my liege! I humbly trust that even one such as I, a mere bookworm, may yet prove to be of some utility under your wise leadership. Nice, I don't often get a chance to speak with such formality. It felt pretty good!"
Xingqiu,Chat: Night of Solitude,'Twas on a deserted moonlit night that the hero approached the vile dragon's limpid lair...
Xingqiu,Chat: Literature,I never embark on a journey without a good book to accompany me.
Xingqiu,Chat: Taking a Break,"Now this is what I call, ""a moment of solitude."
Xingqiu,Chat: Reading,"Oh my goodness... Oh my gosh... Wow— Huh? ""All will be revealed in the next volume""? Aw, drat..."
Xingqiu,Chat: New Books,"If my calculations are correct, Wanwen Bookhouse is due to receive a batch of new releases today. Might we add a small detour to our adventure?"
Xingqiu,When It Rains,My family makes ornate umbrellas that block neither rain nor shine. Their sole purpose is for decoration upon a wall.
Xingqiu,After the Rain,"Good, the rain has stopped. Any longer and my books would have gotten wet."
Xingqiu,When It Snows,"Only when it snows like this would I prefer to be at home than in a book store. For there is a well-stocked fireplace at home, while there is no fire allowed in book stores."
Xingqiu,When the Sun Is Out,"Great weather for practicing martial arts... But perfect weather for reading. Hey, what's that ridiculous look for? You look as if you're trying to decipher some strange text written on my forehead."
Xingqiu,Good Morning,"Morning! The morn hours are precious, spend them on that which matters to you."
Xingqiu,Good Afternoon,"I am uninclined to eat a heavy meal this luncheon, but instead indulge in some baked treats. As long as I eat in the study, my father and brother never have to know! Oh, you want to join me? Well... As long as you don't get crumbs on the books, I suppose it's fine."
Xingqiu,Good Evening,"What say you we snatch a few fireflies and read in the light they give? Hey, I'm joking. Seriously, don't, it's bad for your eyesight."
Xingqiu,Good Night,You will find me in the same place as ever tomorrow. So I'll see you then. Unless you manage to get lost on the way.
Xingqiu,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 3,"I always have to put on an act around other people, because they see me only as the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. It's a relief that I can just be myself around you. I think it's because you don't see me in the same way."
Xingqiu,About Us: Reading Buddies,I would say we are book buddies. Huh? Combat? Guhua Clan? Comrades in arms? ...What on earth are you talking about? I told you that's our little secret!
Xingqiu,About Us: Swornship Friendship Lv. 6,"We should become sworn siblings, let's go to the altar at Jueyun Karst. Nope, no ifs, no buts, you know too much about me! You know the real me, the one I normally have to hide. I simply can't let you go until you promise me you will go through with it!"
Xingqiu,About the Vision: Ancient Books Friendship Lv. 3,"There aren't many records on matters concerning Visions, but I do have a passage dedicated to the topic in my collection of ancient texts. I can lend it to you if you want."
Xingqiu,About the Vision: Realization Friendship Lv. 5,"I've come to an epiphany based on some things I've been reading — ultimately, the arts of both the polearm and the sword are just the art of the ""eye."" Ugh, it's a little difficult to explain... If you want to know more, come with me to Wangshan Hall. But first, you have to promise me you won't laugh."
Xingqiu,Something to Share,"Must-see places in Liyue? That's a tough question. Hmm... The place I would miss the most if it disappeared would be Wanwen Bookhouse, first and foremost. The Guhua Sect would be in the top ten, too."
Xingqiu,Interesting Things Friendship Lv. 4,"I used to like rabbits, but I'm more a fan of stags now. To me, the saying ""May my final stand be a monument to chivalry"" is about abandoning worldly possessions and reaching enlightenment. But the stag's final resting place represents the hope for life anew. Oh, how I'd love to see it again.[TN • 1]"
Xingqiu,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"I have great respect for Lady Beidou. I just wish she wouldn't call me ""kid"" and ruffle my hair each time she sees me."
Xingqiu,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"In her capacity as the Tianquan, I am obliged to respect her. Otherwise, it could create issues for my father and brother. On a personal level? Let me think... I think I will go with ""no comment,"" I shan't speak ill of others."
Xingqiu,About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, dear Chongyun. Though he understands me quite well, one has to exercise caution when teaming up with him to go on a quest. He is making good progress in the martial arts, but I would say he hasn't quite internalized the chivalric code yet... He needs more practice. Especially at eating spicy food."
Xingqiu,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"When Yun Jin drinks a beverage she is fond of, she will be inspired to write a new play. So, I keep a jar of tea leaves under my bed at all times, ready to deliver to her on the day that her inspiration dries up. This way, I shall never run out of heroic tales to listen to!"
Xingqiu,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yes, the young lady who is now the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. If you're asking what I think about her as a person... Well, there are all sorts of rumors about the way she works. But I think if you really want to understand someone, you need to find out what they are really after.(Actual Voice-Over: Ah yes, the young lady who is now the master of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. If you're asking what I think about her as a person... Well, there are all sorts of rumors about the way she works. But I think if you really want to understand someone, you need to find out what they are really after.)"
Xingqiu,About Qiqi Friendship Lv. 4,I've always thought that there is more to Qiqi than meets the eye. But it's impossible to have a conversation with her when Baizhu's around. Hmm... We could wait till Baizhu makes a home call to one of his other patients and corner her...
Xingqiu,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"When you first spot Xiangling out and about, the first thing you should do is check the look on her face. Especially when she's just coming back from collecting new ingredients — the more excited she looks, the more dangerous it is to approach. Because if she sees you, she'll force you to taste-test her latest concoction... I usually get Chongyun to handle these situations, hehe..."
Xingqiu,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,Where does Xinyan perform? Anywhere from Chihu Rock to Yujing Terrace — no spot is untouched by her disruptive presence... A quiet day when I can curl up with a good book is a rare treasure indeed.
Xingqiu,About Albedo Friendship Lv. 6,"I've thought of all the illustrations I want for each of the major event in the next three volumes! I should write my thoughts down before I forget them, and send them to Mr. Kreideprinz..."
Xingqiu,"About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4 Farewell, Archaic Lord","My father and brother entertained that gentleman as a guest once. From the way they were acting, he must be a very high-profile figure indeed. I also heard that he directs funerals for adepti, so he must surely have some inside information. We should do some digging and see what we can find out about him!"
Xingqiu,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4,"I find that Miss Shenhe seems to look at me somewhat fiercely, so I daren't approach her lightly. Bizzare, did I inadvertently upset her? Or maybe... upset someone close to her?"
Xingqiu,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"Have you heard the expression ""same person, different face""? Ms. Yelan gives me precisely this feeling. When she came to visit my family, my father and brother treated her with respect, and she was pleasant and polite in return. She seemed like a kind and mature young lady to me. But when I saw her elsewhere, she gave a completely different impression."
Xingqiu,More About Xingqiu: I,"Are you keeping well, my liege? If you have no other matters to attend to, might I recommend a trip to the Wanwen Bookhouse?"
Xingqiu,More About Xingqiu: II Friendship Lv. 3,You ask me why I enjoy reading in solitude? ...Studiousness can hardly be considered a bad habit. There's not much more to it than that. Really.
Xingqiu,More About Xingqiu: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Your schedule is free today? Wonderful. I am ready to leave whenever you are. ...My book? Oh, never mind that! I can always pick up where I left off when I get back. But those in distress who need our assistance cannot afford to wait."
Xingqiu,More About Xingqiu: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"You feel inspired, you say? You want to write a martial arts detective novel based on our adventures together? And you want to call it the ""Chronicles of Wanwen""? Hahaha... It's a good idea, it really is. But I'll have to decline, I'm sorry. Yes, really..."
Xingqiu,More About Xingqiu: V Friendship Lv. 6,"""A weaver of verses who draws from an ocean of expression..."" That's the reputation I aspire to. But you're the only person I can share that with. I am actually writing a novel... but I can't let you see it. Not yet. The time will come, though... You'll be able to read it when it's on sale in book stores all over Liyue."
Xingqiu,Xingqiu's Hobbies,"Evidently, my hobby is reading. I'll read anything and everything. ...What's that mischievous grin for? Oh. That's between the two of us, okay? It's not appropriate to discuss it out loud. There's no point in bringing it up anyway.[TN • 2]"
Xingqiu,Xingqiu's Troubles,"What annoys me? Hmmm... Well, one day my brother will inherit the family business. What will happen to me then? I fear my current carefree existence would... Oh—no no no, it's not about my status or anything like that. I don't care for that kind of thing. I think my brother is something of a simpleton and I would probably end up having to do most of his job for him..."
Xingqiu,Favorite Food,I like baked goods and Yue-style seafood. Probably because I'm used to quite a bland diet at home.
Xingqiu,Least Favorite Food,"I hate carrots. When I was young, my mother would mash them up into... Ugh, I can't go on. Just thinking about it makes me feel sick..."
Xingqiu,Receiving a Gift: I,I need only sample this delight but once for its aroma to remain forever in my memory.
Xingqiu,Receiving a Gift: II,"With cooking skills as good as yours, it'd be a waste not to open a restaurant, wouldn't you agree?"
Xingqiu,Receiving a Gift: III,"I couldn't possibly. But please, you eat your fill. I insist."
Xingqiu,Birthday: Wishing,May this day of your birth be filled with much mirth!
Xingqiu,Birthday: Customs,"According to historical records, Tiancheng's stone bridge was formed by a fallen rock spear thrown by the Geo Archon Morax in battle. If you walk along the bridge on your birthday and throw some Mora into the sea from both sides, you will be blessed in the coming year... Your birthday only comes once a year, so be quick about it if you wanna go... I'm not kidding, it's true! Go try it and you'll see!"
Xingqiu,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"Were it not for my capability, the cause that so inspires me would remain confined to the pages that extol its virtues."
Xingqiu,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Had I no moral compass, my efforts would have been misguided. Doomed to grasp at shadows while missing the substance, I would have become a philistine that seeks only violence."
Xingqiu,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"There is a cause that I seek to champion, yet few in Liyue share my aspiration. This I have known for a long time, for it is a path I have walked for many years."
Xingqiu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I am most grateful for your company on my journey. I am proud of my achievements, both in the martial arts and in championing the cause so dear to my heart. ...Ah, I guess there's no need to euphemize any longer. Chivalry! That is the cause that inspires me, and that I seek to champion. Why should I shy away from it, I am sure my father and brother are under no illusion as to what I stand for by now. ...But of course, I still need to be somewhat discreet in the way I go about my business."
Xinyan,Hello,"Xinyan's the name, an' rock 'n' roll's the game — and I'm the only one who plays it in Liyue Harbor. Been thinking about staging concerts elsewhere lately, but... Hmm... Well, word is that you've been all over the place, Traveler. So, what say you sign me up for your world tour? Anywhere's good!"
Xinyan,Chat: Vigor,"If there's fire in your soul, you gotta rock 'n' roll. So c'mon! Let's get movin'!"
Xinyan,Chat: New Song,"I just came up with an awesome new riff, wanna hear it?"
Xinyan,Chat: Look!,Whatever's going on over there... Looks pretty rock 'n' roll to me!
Xinyan,When It Rains,It's really comin' down... Would be all sorts of bad if my guitar got wet.
Xinyan,When Thunder Strikes,"This rain ain't clearin' any time soon... but the show's still on, people!"
Xinyan,When It Snows,Hmm... How do we attract more folks in this weather? Right! How about we stage a rock 'till you drop snowstorm endurance challenge?
Xinyan,When the Wind Is Blowing,"Ack! Gotta find some cover, quick, or my hairdo's gonna fall apart!"
Xinyan,Good Morning,Mornin'! I was just warming my voice up. We're in real good shape today.
Xinyan,Good Afternoon,"Alright, that's a wrap! *yawns* If there's nothin' else, I'll go take a nap somewhere..."
Xinyan,Good Evening,Almost about to go live over here. You comin'?
Xinyan,Good Night,"Me? Oh, I've got a guitar to maintain, tunes to rewrite... I mean, I just got offstage, there's no way I can sleep right now."
Xinyan,About Xinyan: Frightening,"Not afraid of me, are you? Some folks say I've got eyes like knives, that I don't wear my clothes right, that I don't speak right. They give me a pretty wide berth, too. Really, can't a girl sport her own style without being looked at like she's some weird creature outta who-knows-where?"
Xinyan,About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll,"Rock 'n' roll came to Liyue from Fontaine, so I guess you could call it a new thing. But it's not too hot around here. Most think it's an awful racket not fit for human ears. And that's why I appreciate everyone who does come listen, haha!"
Xinyan,About Us: The Audience,"You wanna hear me play? Come to the front — it sounds best from there! *clears throat* Alright then, comin' at you from the one and only rock stage in Liyue!"
Xinyan,About Us: Kindred Spirits Friendship Lv. 6,"And here I was wonderin' why we got on so well! So you're not from this world, and that's why you don't care for its rules. Now that's how life should be like! Lose the red tape, and live free!"
Xinyan,About Us: Invitation Friendship Lv. 6,"I'd sure love to add some extra flavor to my rock 'n' roll. Wanna get on the drums next time? You've got a good sense of rhythm. ...You've never played? Don't sweat it, it's a question of soul, not skill! Give it a go, I just know you'll be great!"
Xinyan,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"I'm guessin' that I'm the only person in Teyvat who uses the fire from their Vision in rock performances. Some say I should respect that power more... But the way I see it, the gods gave the Vision to me, so they like my style, don'cha think?"
Xinyan,Something to Share: Opera,"You ever heard of opera? It's what those rich guys listen to at their banquets. It's all tenor this and falsetto that... Getting so uptight about music, ugh — it's just not rock 'n' roll."
Xinyan,Something to Share: Naming Friendship Lv. 4,"I made this guitar myself, y'know? Based it off a rock 'n' roll instrument from Fontaine at first, but it stopped looking like the original real fast. I wanted to give it a rad name, like ""The Fyre Lyre,"" or ""The Jadebreaker,"" or ""The Hill Stiller."" Still, feels like we're missin' something... Any ideas?"
Xinyan,Interesting Things,"My favorite stage outfit's one I made by hand outta Silk Flowers. You must've seen those flowers before, haven'tcha? Passion-red, they are — a perfect match for my music!"
Xinyan,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"I have dinner at the Wanmin Restaurant often. If Xiangling's got some time on her hands, we'll chat till it's real late. Eh? You wanna know what I order? See... I actually eat everything she makes. It's never the same thing, and the flavor's different each time, too. Ooh, she's the rock star of the culinary world, she is!"
Xinyan,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"There was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what. Like, hey, someone gets it! I agreed right away... But when I got there, I found out that he was the consultant at the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. What a weird guy. I mean, how was that appropriate?"
Xinyan,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"Y'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so..."
Xinyan,About Baizhu Friendship Lv. 4,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away. Haha, now it ducks up Dr. Baizhu's sleeve every time I'm around. I only discovered afterwards that snakes are very sensitive to vibrations."
Xinyan,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past! I even wrote them a song. Nowadays, I just need to sing the first line, and most all the sailors will join in. It's fast becoming a new sea shanty, it is."
Xinyan,About Chongyun Friendship Lv. 4,"He's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!"
Xinyan,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"I've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor. Always greets me cheerily too, saying ""I like people who play with fire, they're good for business"" or somethin' like that... She's a bit bizarre, I tell you."
Xinyan,About Yun Jin Friendship Lv. 4,"Tell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha."
Xinyan,More About Xinyan: I,"You wanna know more about me? Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll."
Xinyan,More About Xinyan: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Back when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say ""that's unladylike!"" *sigh* Talk about prejudice."
Xinyan,More About Xinyan: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Say, do you notice anything different 'bout me today? I did some facial massages to relax my mouth and eyes, and practiced smiling less broadly in front of a mirror for half an hour. So, how'd it go? Do I look a bit less fierce than usual? ...Even scarier? Huh, okay..."
Xinyan,More About Xinyan: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Thanks for staying to jam with me! It's almost time for lunch. I've brought your share as well! We've got tomatoes, sausages, fried eggs... Say what? I don't seem like the type? H—Hey now, don't you look down on me. M—Making a nice-looking meal was no problem at all!"
Xinyan,More About Xinyan: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces. I'm perfectly capable of living normally. I can sew, I can grow flowers and keep fish, and make nice-looking meals. I'm allowed to like anything... or anyone I want, right?"
Xinyan,Xinyan's Hobbies,"Hobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into? When everything you love comes together into one thing, the place and time loses all importance. You just need to enjoy it to the fullest, and express yourself to your hearts content! I can never get enough of that feelin'!"
Xinyan,Xinyan's Troubles,"I send children a-crying every time I accidentally lock eyes with them on the road. *sigh* If only there was a way to make me look a little less scary. But I've tried everything, and nothing sticks..."
Xinyan,Favorite Food,"The lunch down at the Liyue dockyards rocks! Oily, meaty... Bit skimpy on the vegetables, but I could never get tired of it! Far as I'm concerned, a whole day in the dockyards is worth it just for the lunch!"
Xinyan,Least Favorite Food,"Not that I'm picky, but I can't stand bland food. If it's supposed to be salty or spicy, make it salty or spicy! You can't have a good time if you don't go all-in on the flavor! Even if all I had on hand were enough ingredients for one serving of Jewelry Soup, I'd make sure I'd do right by them!"
Xinyan,Receiving a Gift: I,"Wowee, you've rocked my socks off with this one. I am moving to the groove of your awesome food! Mm-mm!"
Xinyan,Receiving a Gift: II,"The taste ain't bad, but it's lackin' that special spark... I can help you with the presentation if you want?"
Xinyan,Receiving a Gift: III,"Hmm... You don't mind if I add a little something to spice things up, do ya?"
Xinyan,Birthday,"Happy birthday! I made some embroidery especially for you. Check it out — I sewed both our images on in the style of Fontaine's dolls. Pretty cute, eh? ...Why are you looking at me like that? Wh—What, it's not that weird that I can do embroidery!"
Xinyan,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"That's the groove, alright! That's what I'm talking about!"
Xinyan,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,I'm on fire lately. Look out for my next performance!
Xinyan,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"With such power, who knows what never-before-seen bangers I'll be able to come up with? Thanks so much! My next work won't disappoint!"
Xinyan,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I feel your awesome, overflowing passion! Tell you what, I'll write you a rock song. It'll be your song - and I'll play it just for you!"
Yae Miko,Hello,"I am the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine. The purpose of my visit is to monitor your every move, for such is the order of the shrine... Oh, come on, don't be so nervous. It's only officialese, for goodness' sake. I couldn't just go gallivanting around for no reason at all, could I? Now, come on, do something amusing for me."
Yae Miko,Chat: Creative Writing,"Traveling to other worlds is all that anyone seems be [sic] writing about these days. Huh, goodness knows what they find so disappointing about their own world."
Yae Miko,Chat: Stories,Most humans could have the entirety of their fleeting lives chronicled in but a few short lines... Their stories really make for terribly dull reading.
Yae Miko,Chat: Mortal World,"Personally, I think the idea of things staying the same forever is quite beautiful. *sigh* But alas, that is simply not the way the world works."
Yae Miko,When It Rains,"If this rain keeps up, my fur will be dripping wet..."
Yae Miko,When Thunder Strikes,"Many people dread the sound of thunder... To me, it sounds fondly familiar."
Yae Miko,When It Snows,"I always see these non-sentient kitsune pouncing headfirst into the snow, scavenging for food... Hmm? You'd like to see me do that? Hah! I'm sure you would."
Yae Miko,Good Morning,"Morning. You look awfully drowsy, didn't you sleep well? Tsk-tsk, come on then, what is it? What mischief were you up to last night, hmm?"
Yae Miko,Good Afternoon,"Hmm... ugh, what a headache. What should I have for lunch? Not Fried Tofu again, I'm in the mood for something a little lighter today. Ah — I know. I haven't seen the Yashiro Commission girl in a while. Let's get her to make us a little something."
Yae Miko,Good Evening,"The moon is simply magnificent tonight. We mustn't squander it. Come, join me for a moonlight stroll — I won't take no for an answer."
Yae Miko,Good Night,"I suppose I should get some sleep. Hmm, I must say, I do find it hard to doze off peacefully without the soothing sound of thunder booming in the background."
Yae Miko,About Yae Miko: Eternity,"Eternity means never having to let go of what you already have. But on the other hand, it also means giving up on all other possibilities. That's just the way of the world... No one can have everything."
Yae Miko,About Yae Miko: Interests,"Humans are just fascinating creatures, that's why I'm so fond of them. They live such short lives, but for the time they're around, they shine as bright as the midday sun. There are some whose light never grows dim, even over great stretches of time... These are the lives that make for real page-turners."
Yae Miko,About Us: Authorship,"Boring. Utterly boring... Ugh, what could have possibly persuaded these people to become authors? Say, why don't you write out your story and submit it to Yae Publishing House? I'm sure that would keep me amused— Ahem, I'm sure it would be a best-seller."
Yae Miko,About Us: Erosion Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Sealing yourself away from the rest of the world may only serve to accelerate the effects of erosion... Imagine, a world consisting of you and you alone, with no one else to reflect you back at yourself... how awful that would be. Whenever we are together, it is vital that we always shine a light for each other, okay? It's rather difficult to remain enlightened in the dark."
Yae Miko,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"You're saying... you like how I wear my Vision? You certainly have an eye for a priceless treasure. Well then, I bet you'd like to pet it."
Yae Miko,Something to Share Friendship Lv. 4,"Heat oil on a medium-high flame in a pot. Add the tofu and reduce the heat to a low flame. Cook until golden-brown, take it out, then serve piping hot. There you have it, Fried Tofu. There is nothing more delicious in this world. Well, I've told you how to make it, have I not? Why are you still standing there?"
Yae Miko,Interesting Things,"Though I occasionally get a little weary of the sight of it — I can't exactly avoid seeing it at the Grand Narukami Shrine, after all — my fate is intimately intertwined with the Sacred Sakura."
Yae Miko,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Locking herself away in the Plane of Euthymia when she clearly wants to be out — it's just willful self-torture, really... On the other hand, it's also rather stubborn-but-cute, don't you think?"
Yae Miko,About Kamisato Ayato Friendship Lv. 4,"The Yashiro rascal... he's always been an unpredictable one, even as a child. Don't be taken in by his warm smile. There's no knowing what devious scheme might be brewing inside his head — it's really quite maddening... What do you mean, ""sly as a fox""? Hmph, if you're trying to insinuate that he and I are anything alike, you are sorely mistaken."
Yae Miko,About Kamisato Ayaka Friendship Lv. 4 The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia,"I'm very fond indeed of the Yashiro Commission girl. She adroitly handles every matter that comes before her. Unfortunately, it's often thankless work. Pity. Were she not a member of the Kamisato Clan, I would have long since snatched her up for the Yae Publishing House."
Yae Miko,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Not the sharpest tengu in the forest — she certainly didn't inherit the brilliant mind of daddy tengu, that's for sure. *sigh* How shall I put this? I suppose being blunt and dispensing with tact has its own advantages... But I do hope that the next time she visits the shrine, she keeps to herself. I've got better things to do than answer her incessant questions about Ei."
Yae Miko,About Yoimiya Friendship Lv. 4 The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia,"Naganohara fireworks are well worth the wait every year. Word is that she caused quite an uproar among the Tenryou Commission recently by setting off fireworks all over the place. Heh, I'm sure the members of the Kujou Clan must've turned purple with rage... A pity that I couldn't be there to see it for myself."
Yae Miko,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm, now that you mention it, it's been a while since I last saw Ganyu. Before the Sakoku Decree came into effect, the two of us would often meet to discuss bilateral relations between our two nations. I always found her quite reliable. The next time you go to Liyue, take her some more fresh Sea Ganoderma for me."
Yae Miko,About Sangonomiya Kokomi Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"These Divine Priestesses seem to be getting cuter every generation. I wonder how she looks performing the Dance of Divine Peace... Perhaps even little schools of fish swish around her while she spins. If she's ever looking for a more experienced head shrine maiden to learn from, I'd be quite happy to share a few tips with her... Hehe, as long as she asked me nicely, of course."
Yae Miko,About Kunikuzushi Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"I thought it was a disaster waiting to happen at the time, but she insisted that she wasn't going to lift a finger against the object of her own creation. Had I known how things would unfold, I would have simply disposed of it without her knowing. Hmm? What about now? Hehe... Well, we're no longer waiting for the disaster to happen, are we?"
Yae Miko,About Arataki Itto Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, the oddball oni. Heh, I hear that he's been quite a pain for the Kujou Clan. The Tenryou Commission wanted to remove his messages on the bulletin board, claiming that they were ""harmful to public order."" I made quite sure they stayed put, haha. He's an entertaining character... you don't often see oni like him in this day and age."
Yae Miko,About Gorou Friendship Lv. 4,He certainly has a beautiful tail. Although... mine's a little softer.
Yae Miko,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yes, the little ninja child... If there's one thing she can do, it's stay hidden. Kano Nana constantly complains to me about it. Apparently, she now spends so much of her time searching for Sayu that she barely has any time to read anymore. If you ask me, I'd say that Sayu has a secret ally who is helping her hide all the time..."
Yae Miko,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"I've heard a lot about Miyuki's little sister. Quite the character, I'm told. Although she comes from a family of shrine maidens, she's gone her own way in life — tried her hand at many different trades, studied abroad in Liyue, even ended up joining the Arataki Gang... Fascinating girl. Maybe I should have Miyuki introduce me. Yes, that'll work — Miyuki wouldn't dream of refusing my request."
Yae Miko,More About Yae Miko: I,"Oh? You'd like to know more about me? I'm willing to tell, but what will I gain in exchange, hmm? It has to be a fair trade. So you tell me all about you, and I'll tell you all about me. Deal?"
Yae Miko,More About Yae Miko: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Kitsune Saiguu said that she was going off on a long trip, and she's never been back since. *sigh* At the time, I wasn't the least bit inclined to take on the burden of managing the Grand Narukami Shrine. So she told me that as Guuji, I would be able to eat all the Fried Tofu I desired. As if that would be a convincing reason... That woman spoke so much nonsense, honestly, she could be so insufferable..."
Yae Miko,More About Yae Miko: III Friendship Lv. 4 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"I decided to found Yae Publishing House simply because I wished to read more interesting light novels, that's all. But, it turns out that seeing frazzled authors scraping the bottom of their barrel in a desperate attempt to get their novels finished is where the real amusement comes from. You wouldn't believe some of the excuses they come up with when they're trying to get a deadline extension. Oh, so much more creative than the novels themselves."
Yae Miko,More About Yae Miko: IV Friendship Lv. 5 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Even supernatural beings eventually pass away, including gods. It's a terrible shame when their tales are lost to time along with them, never to be remembered again. The problem is, only those with first-class writing and composition skills are qualified to commit these stories to paper. If there is no qualified writing talent in the world, we must cultivate it... Yes, home-grown writers are what we need, capable of adequately capturing these stories with the written word."
Yae Miko,More About Yae Miko: V Friendship Lv. 6 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Though I'm an avid reader of novels written by others, I've yet to pick up the pen myself. Writing a novel is quite an undertaking, after all. But, if there comes a day when you reach the end of your adventure and want somebody to record it — and if I happen to have the time when that day comes... We'll see."
Yae Miko,Yae Miko's Hobbies,"My favorite pastime is reading other people's stories. My second favorite is watching other people squirm... If I could find a way to combine the two, haha... Oh, that would be entertainment in its purest form."
Yae Miko,Yae Miko's Troubles Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Peace and tranquility seems to be all the rage nowadays, but it gets dreadfully boring after a while..."
Yae Miko,Favorite Food Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Have you ever heard of a dish called ""Kitsune Udon""? It's quite simple, really... Just Fried Tofu served on top of Udon noodles. What do you think? Noodles and Fried Tofu, that's all. Doesn't it sound heavenly?"
Yae Miko,Least Favorite Food,"Anything that has been pickled is firmly off-limits for me... I don't care whether it's Medaka or Kiviak, what sort of person can stand that vile stench? I, for one, am Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, and I refuse to defile myself by ingesting such pungent things."
Yae Miko,Receiving a Gift: I,"My, my! You really know what appeals to my tastes, don't you."
Yae Miko,Receiving a Gift: II,"Since you've made it yourself, I guess having a little taste is the least I can do, haha..."
Yae Miko,Receiving a Gift: III,How should I put this... There's so much room for improvement that the only way is up.
Yae Miko,Birth Date,"Ah, so today is your birthday... ""On your ceremonious reckoning of years, I task my kin with seeing to it that that which you seek, you shall surely find, and that that for which your heart longs, you shall surely receive. Remain pure of heart and true of spirit, and their protection shall be bestowed on you."" There you go. May all go well in your year ahead, and may all your wishes be fulfilled. Are we done?"
Yae Miko,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"When training to become a shrine maiden, the title of ""Chokkai"" is granted once one has completed their requisite studies and can correctly chant for ceremonies. This might be very straightforward for humans, but it's the most difficult step for the kitsune... We are only foxes, after all."
Yae Miko,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"The training required to become a Guuji's Assistant, or ""Seikai,"" is arduous indeed. You must observe a myriad of harsh restrictions... There is only one way to make it through: snack at night, and make sure you don't get caught."
Yae Miko,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Attaining the rank of ""Meikai"" requires one to decipher the workings of the world, transcend its limitations, and fathom all phenomena within. Usually, any who reach this level are granted a Vision and a lifespan far beyond that of the average kitsune."
Yae Miko,Feelings about Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6 Omnipresence Over Mortals,"Throughout history, only the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine has ever held the rank of ""Joukai."" It is an honorary title, not related to the capabilities of the holder. But of course, if I were to declare myself the most powerful Joukai in history, I don't see why there'd be anything wrong with that."
Yanfei,Hello,"My name is Yanfei, top legal expert in Liyue — and for the avoidance of doubt, no one else comes close! From commercial litigation, to civil mediation, to criminal lawsuits, I'm fully versed in every area of the law, and I guarantee you a swift and satisfactory conclusion to your case! My contact details... Where should I write this down? ...Hmm, paper will just get lost, and it'll only rub off if I write it on the back of your hand, so... Aha! I know, I'll just write it here, on the clothes of this... whatever this thing is that follows you around."
Yanfei,Chat: The Law,I'll remind you again: The law can be both a help and a hindrance.
Yanfei,Chat: Work,"Sometimes the law is compatible with human nature, but sometimes the two conflict. Balancing the two is a discipline in its own right..."
Yanfei,Chat: Reading,The case before us... is a strange and unprecedented one indeed.
Yanfei,When It Rains,"Rain! Oh, Lord of Geo, please, do us a favor and clear this up at your earliest convenience... I submit that we cannot afford for the codices to get damp..."
Yanfei,When It Snows,What the... What kind of injurious weather is this!? It's c—cold... Achoo...
Yanfei,When the Sun Is Out,"Ah, this weather's got me in the mood for reciting some laws. Let's see... ""Commercial Law of Liyue,"" Chapter 27, Section 6, Article 3 stipulates that— Wait, what was it...? Oh my goodness, I've completely forgotten! What is wrong with me today...?"
Yanfei,Good Morning,"I have to head out this morning to meet a client about a creditor dispute, but I also have to follow up on a consultation from last week by noon... Alright, time to get to work!"
Yanfei,Good Afternoon,"*yawn* I'm a little sleepy... I know, a vigorous debate should wake me up! And I've got just the topic: ""The Northland Bank's presence in Liyue does more harm than good for our economy."" ...So, are you for or against?"
Yanfei,Good Evening,"The night market? Hmm... I was planning on organizing some files this evening, but if you're going, I can join you. Oh, I should mention — lots of vendors go for the hard sell in the evenings, because they want to be able to start with fresh produce the next day, but also don't want to lose profit on what they have left today.So, leave the negotiating to me. And... If you have any leftovers, those can be my fee."
Yanfei,Good Night,"Need a cure for insomnia? Let me read you the history of the development of Liyue's legal system! None of my friends have ever lasted longer than 20 minutes... Oh, you want something more fast-acting? Then I'll recite from the legal codices! Let me know in the morning which section I got to before you fell asleep! Okay, here I go..."
Yanfei,About Yanfei: Atmosphere,"You think I come across as quite imposing when I'm reading through case files? Huh. Well, that's only when I'm in work mode. It's like... I have an invisible switch, flick it one way and I'm in normal mode, flick it the other way and I switch to work mode. Surely you must have a switch like that, too?"
Yanfei,About Yanfei: Weakness Friendship Lv. 4,"Civil cases are the ones I dread the most. Divorces, custody disputes... It's a thankless task trying to unpack these kinds of cases with logic and reason. You have to be kind, courteous, and patient with your clients, even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion. *sigh* I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law, but honestly, if it were up to me, I'd rather everyone could just get along, so we wouldn't have so many of these cases."
Yanfei,About Us: Rates,"You want legal advice from me? Sure. For legal opinions, I charge a flat rate of 6,000 Mora, for advisory services, my hourly rate is 180,000 Mora, and for commercial law, I charge 710,000 Mora per case — final quote and commission rate depending on the details of your case. Not a bad deal, right?"
Yanfei,About Us: Relationships Friendship Lv. 6,"If you're concerned about what kind of complicated issues you might get tied up in during your travels, your best bet is to bring someone with you who knows and understands the law. Someone like me, for example, whose expertise goes beyond just the law of Liyue... Well, actually, having said that, Fontaine's law is notoriously complicated... Though, with my level of intelligence, getting acquainted with it should be no problem! Anyway... My point is, you can always rely on me!"
Yanfei,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions appear in response to strong desire, so as someone with ideals, it's only natural that I should have received one. Because, above all, I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law. But some people will always insist on playing by their own rules and causing havoc for everyone else... Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!"
Yanfei,Something to Share: Balance Friendship Lv. 4,"This steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.So, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?"
Yanfei,Something to Share: The Rule of Law Friendship Lv. 4,"I have a self-defense method that I call ""Wrath of the Flame,"" based on a punishment called the ""Wrath of the Rock,"" which is detailed in the ancient work ""The Comprehensive Compendium of Liyue Law."" The Lord of Geo is the God of Contracts, and contracts, too, can be seen as a way of restraining people. Haha, ergo, Liyue Harbor has been the City of Contracts since time immemorial."
Yanfei,Interesting Things,"The Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that ""The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset."" Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes."
Yanfei,About Qiqi Friendship Lv. 4,"I heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on! She's definitely destined for greatness...""The young of today shall outperform us tomorrow,"" as they say. I must admit, she has my respect."
Yanfei,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ganyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers."
Yanfei,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"The Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself. Last time, though, I happened to meet their youngest, Xingqiu. To my complete surprise, the lad had no trouble whatsoever keeping up with my train of thought. He was very eloquent, too, and had excellent manners. Mm, definitely not a simpleton."
Yanfei,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"I always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business. They think she's gone a little non compos mentis after being in the funeral business so long... What are these people talking about? The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise. Work is just work — there are no good and bad jobs, or lucky and unlucky jobs, just jobs that need doing.If I had one gripe, it would be that the director rarely comes to me for legal advice, hmph..."
Yanfei,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"Mr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange... Anyway, makes me wonder if my father is hiding something from me. Hmph, alright then — if he won't tell me what's going on, I'll just have to find out for myself..."
Yanfei,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,"You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices. Every round of additions, retractions, and revisions generates mountains of material. Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law. Once I've finished memorizing these, I need to step up my productivity..."
Yanfei,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4,"The Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me."
Yanfei,About Eula Friendship Lv. 4,"Eula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all."
Yanfei,About Yelan Friendship Lv. 4,"Yelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is... I feel like she's able to read my mind at any given moment when talking to her... Yes, in the future, I need to make absolutely sure I don't get on the wrong side of her."
Yanfei,About Kuki Shinobu Friendship Lv. 4,"Shinobu? I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back..."
Yanfei,More About Yanfei: I,"A client? Very pleased to meet you, here's my card. I'm afraid I can't leave my desk today, if it's a dispute we're dealing with then please bring the relevant parties here to see me. Let me just give you a breakdown of my fees — one moment...Huh? You came just to chat? Uh... no fee necessary then. So just to clarify... you came to chat as friends with a legal expert that you've never met before... care to explain?"
Yanfei,More About Yanfei: II Friendship Lv. 3,"These antlers? Oh... well my father is an adeptus, so I have adeptus blood myself. Still, I was born during peacetime here in Liyue — I never signed a contract with Rex Lapis. Naturally, I don't have to concern myself with adeptal affairs — I'm free to focus on the life I want to live. Works for me! Hee-hee."
Yanfei,More About Yanfei: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Contracts of that magnitude — lifelong commitments... I've only ever signed one with my father. Uh... it's about living happily, I suppose. That's the kind of person he is. I'm proud of him for that. If he'd wanted me to sign a different contract, say... one about working myself into the ground, or stepping on others to achieve success... I would've ran away by now!"
Yanfei,More About Yanfei: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Sometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly. The other party might win compensation way in excess of the damages, or pay damages far exceeding the costs... Such is the price of violating a contract. Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!Think about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts. People are a lot less likely to violate contracts when they see the fallout. Making sure that people realize the importance of contracts is a crucial part of my work!"
Yanfei,More About Yanfei: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Most of the time, I feel that I have a happy and laid back existence. I have a successful career, clothes on my back, and the freedom to go wherever I please. I've also got quite a way with words — nobody can beat me in a debate. And yet, there is no law or standard that can define a happy life.For me... interesting people and engaging affairs, knowing where to go and which path to choose... these are all enough to bring me happiness. And on that note, you too are a source of happiness for me.In any case, whatever the life you live, the most important thing is to respect and understand the law. After all, as soon as you stray from the law, the world begins to fall to ruin."
Yanfei,Yanfei's Hobbies,"My hobbies are reading and appraisal. Reading begets knowledge, appraisal improves judgment. As such, I read everything and appraise anything. If you don't believe me, bring something over sometime. If there's a market for it, my estimate won't be far off. Take this stone for example... must be... 600 Mora."
Yanfei,Yanfei's Troubles,"My friends from the Communications Office often get me to go fishing with them. They say it's to exchange angling tips, but deep down everyone's keen to show off. I've gotten the better of everyone a hundred different ways, but they continue to scrutinize my business... After so much success, it's gotten a little embarrassing... So every time, I end up taking advantage of my ingenious acting skills to make myself seem humble, you know? What's with the face — are you doubting me?"
Yanfei,Favorite Food,"Oh! On that note, let me recommend my one true love. Tofu — tofu all the way! Light in flavor, tender in texture, not to mention smooth and nourishing. It goes well with all manner of soups and dishes, and more importantly — it's available throughout the seasons! Beauty over complexity... tofu dishes are my kind of flavor."
Yanfei,Least Favorite Food,"I don't like cold dishes... maybe it's because I rarely eat them. When I would get home late, my father used to keep a lantern lit for me. He'd hear me coming and ask me if I was hungry. In his words: ""The best dishes are served hot."
Yanfei,Receiving a Gift: I,Tastes pretty great! Seems like you did your homework when it comes to the unwritten Law of Tofu.
Yanfei,Receiving a Gift: II,"There's a saying in Liyue: ""Food is life."" I gotta admit, the supporting evidence is pretty compelling."
Yanfei,Receiving a Gift: III,"...I got it! I'll put it back on the fire for a bit, that'll do the trick."
Yanfei,Birthday,"Happy birthday! Here, this is for you. I've collated legislation from all the nations — you're planning to go traveling, right? It will serve you well to familiarize yourself with the law of the different lands.Don't study too hard mind you, or else... I won't be of any use to you."
Yanfei,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"""Do not seek to emulate the past, for there is no law that can suffice for all time""... This is a lesson I must always bear in mind."
Yanfei,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,Only by adhering to the law can the people solve life's myriad of problems.
Yanfei,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Studying the law allows one to have grounded conversations, whilst learning martial arts allows one to prevail against groundless violence. Hey, wait a minute... does this count as martial arts...?"
Yanfei,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"Well, I guess I've mastered both the pen and the sword! I've been lucky to have you with me through to the end of my training. Compensation? Uhh... a twenty-four-hour specialist personal advisor? Sounds good... But no haggling!"
Yelan,Hello,"Hello, Traveler. Call me Yelan. I think you may need my help, and I just so happen to be interested in some information you have. In other words — you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."
Yelan,Chat: Tip-Off,I got a new letter from an informant. Looks like the situation has changed again.
Yelan,Chat: Truancy,"Good roll... Alright, maybe I'll take one more day off, and knock out the rest of the work once I'm feeling up to it."
Yelan,Chat: Identity,Navigating the world is a whole lot easier with a few different identities to choose from. Need me to come up with some for you?
Yelan,When It Rains,"It's raining again? Oh, this isn't good... If the rain washes away the traces, it's gonna set us back a long way..."
Yelan,When Thunder Strikes,Only innocent children and timid adults are scared of thunder. But you're not either of those... are you?
Yelan,When It Snows,It's getting a little cold... Time to bundle up.
Yelan,When the Sun Is Out,This blinding sunlight is such a pain... No way I can get a nap in this weather.
Yelan,When the Wind Is Blowing,There's a restlessness in the wind... Hmm...
Yelan,Good Morning,Mmm~ So early... I usually get up at noon if I don't have any urgent work.
Yelan,Good Afternoon,"Ah, I'm getting sleepy. Think I'll take a nap... Don't wake me. I'll wake up naturally when it's time to work."
Yelan,Good Evening,"Good evening. Have you had dinner? What did you have, how was it? Oh... Just making conversation. Don't think anything of it."
Yelan,Good Night,"Come on now, drink your milk and go to sleep. What? You're not a kid? Hehe... Alright, well, I'll just leave it right here, it's yours if you want it. I usually fall asleep well after midnight. Full disclosure — if you're a sleep talker, I can't promise I won't take notes, kay?"
Yelan,About Yelan: Duties,"The Qixing know Liyue like the back of their hands. But there's certain information out there that can only be obtained using more specialized methods. That's my area of expertise, so I generally take care of all those assignments myself."
Yelan,About Yelan: Rumors Friendship Lv. 4,"Some say the boss of Yanshang Teahouse is a young entrepreneur who got rich overnight; some say there's a sickly and frail senior employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs living as a hermit outside the city; others say you should stay away from restricted areas, or you'll get haunted by a blue ghost... Obviously, most civilians have never heard the name Yelan before. So you can safely laugh off all these rumors."
Yelan,About Us: Relationship,Huh? What's that look on your face for? You don't have to be on guard around me. I never scheme against people who have my stamp of approval.
Yelan,About Us: Deception Friendship Lv. 6,"Don't be too ready to believe people when they cross their heart and hope to die. Sweet talkers only say what you want to hear. And think twice before meeting someone else's gaze — your eyes speak volumes about what you're thinking. When it comes down to it, we're friends, and if somebody ever conned you, I'd feel like I'd been cheated, too."
Yelan,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Wherever there's important information to be found, the stakes involved in extracting it are often fatal. It doesn't matter how big or reliable the team under you may be, you can never completely rule out the risk. The bottom line is, have enough force at your fingertips to control the situation. I got lucky — I got my Vision just a few days after realizing that. Otherwise... you'd probably be talking to a very disheveled-looking ghost right now."
Yelan,Anything to Share: Blocking Out Noise,"If you grind Loach Pearls down to size, they make excellent earplugs. They're very sound-proof — you can sleep away blissfully even when there's someone screaming right in your ear... Of course, I hope for your sake that you don't ever need them for that kind of reason."
Yelan,Anything to Share: Fascinating Bracelet,"The bracelet on my right hand? I suppose there's no harm in telling you... It contains a kind of magic used by our clan, and it can send simple messages. The meaning of those messages is buried in the blue light, and only I can decipher them."
Yelan,Anything to Share: Pursuing the Target,"When I'm tracking a target, I like to put psychological pressure on them. In the process of trying to shake me off, they will start to panic, bring in reinforcements, alter their plan... they keep going like this until eventually, they've exposed everything I need to know. Heh..."
Yelan,Interesting Things,"Do you know much about Weasel Thieves? They're not especially intelligent creatures, but once you tame them, they can be trained to steal things and even pick locks. Pretty clear-cut case, isn't it — if even animals can be used as pawns with the right methods, the same has to be all the more true of people, who are constantly plotting and scheming against one another to begin with."
Yelan,About Ningguang: Relationship Friendship Lv. 4,"I got to know Ningguang a long time ago, before she was a Qixing, and we worked together for a while. Maybe I'm partly to thank for the fact that she became a Qixing so quickly. Hehe, who can say? Anyway, she was the one who recommended this job to me. It was a good choice, I'm very well-suited to it."
Yelan,About Ningguang: Expectations Friendship Lv. 4,"Ningguang is good to work with. But I have to be mindful of our identities when I'm out in public. When I meet a Qixing as an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they're ""Sir"" or ""Lady"" to me."
Yelan,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, the secretary... I could never work non-stop like she does, certainly not at that level of efficiency. I guess being half-adeptus must have its perks. Imagine not needing sleep to regain your energy levels..."
Yelan,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't really like people who cram their schedules full, because it doesn't leave any room for negotiation. If something happens that they didn't anticipate, it throws their plans into oblivion, impacting not just themselves but their coworkers, too. But the Yuheng is different. She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her."
Yelan,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4,"I like Yanfei a lot. And I'm not talking about our friendship — as a high-profile legal consultant, important intel in Liyue Harbor is constantly flowing in her direction. Whenever I help her out, I always get some invaluable leads in return. I gotta say though, sometimes I think she respects me a little too much."
Yelan,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4,"The elders in my clan once said that we must always show the utmost respect to the Vigilant Yaksha. Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status."
Yelan,About Xiangling Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah, Xiangling, the lovely little chef. Her ingredients are always top quality, easily as good as Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk. Sometimes I go to her for dried Jueyun Chilis... She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition."
Yelan,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"Of course I remember him — the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. I have dealings with his family all the time. Who knows... maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too."
Yelan,About Tartaglia Friendship Lv. 4,"The Fatui harbinger? He helped me out once — unwittingly. I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base."
Yelan,More About Yelan: I,"The reason I'm willing to bet on you is because of your special status. I think it'll bring me a lot of leads that can get me closer to the truth... Heh, so, got any news for me today?"
Yelan,More About Yelan: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Exchanging information has to be a two-way thing, so I guess I can tell you something about my past. Thanks to my family's connections, I learned some useful skills from the Millelith scouts very early on. Although there are things working against you every step of the way when you're gathering intelligence, as long as I keep myself alive, I'll always emerge as the winner in the end..."
Yelan,More About Yelan: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Clues are links in a chain. You have to trace them all the way back to where everything began before there can be a resolution. To that end, I need to keep my eyes and ears on every part of society, and often, that means having to be more than one person. People sometimes describe me as ""one person, many faces"" and so on... I take it as a compliment."
Yelan,More About Yelan: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Someone once warned me to be careful about digging up certain things from the past. Dig too deep and you might find yourself standing in your own grave, they say... Well, I'm not about to stop, least of all because of anything anyone else has to say. Sure, I can't change the facts, but if it's a choice between the cold, hard truth and blissful unawareness, I'll take the former. What about you? Which would you choose?"
Yelan,More About Yelan: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Tell me something. If I'm gonna stay around, what kind of person do you want me to be to you? Someone you work with? A competitor, who challenges you to sharpen your game? Just another name on your long list of acquaintances, or... somebody more important than that? Depending on what you're hoping for, I can either play that part or become that person."
Yelan,Yelan's Hobbies,"In my free time, I live life completely at random. It's quite simple: I make a list of things to do, then I roll the dice to decide which one I'm going to do next. It's a surprisingly fun game, and it's really broadened my mind... in that sense, it's been quite helpful where my job is concerned."
Yelan,Yelan's Troubles,"My physical fitness isn't actually that great compared with some trained martial artists. It's a hereditary thing that runs in my family. So before getting into really important work, I adjust my schedule to make sure I get enough rest, wait till I have built up enough energy, then strive to finish everything that needs doing in one go. Outside of work, I try my best to live life at a calm and carefree pace. So I'll always decline to take on any strenuous physical labor."
Yelan,Favorite Food,"I like to grind dried Jueyun Chilis and Violetgrass stamens into powder, mix them in with some Yunlai White Tea leaves, and then brew a strong pot of tea. It has the most powerful fragrance that makes you instantly fall in love with it. I prefer drinks like this with a long-lasting aftertaste to things like coffee and spirits."
Yelan,Least Favorite Food,"You have to be very careful with sweets. That powerful sense of satisfaction... it weakens your willpower and makes you relaxed. It only takes a few bites to get addicted, and with long-term consumption, you'll slowly but surely lose your edge."
Yelan,Receiving a Gift: I,"Hm, not bad. Almost good enough to bribe me with."
Yelan,Receiving a Gift: II,"Once you get accustomed to spicy food, everything else tastes bland. That's just the way it is."
Yelan,Receiving a Gift: III,Shall we roll some dice? Whoever gets the lowest number... gets to eat it.
Yelan,Birthday,"If I was to tell you that maybe you shouldn't celebrate too hard today, because you'll let your guard down, and someone out there might just be waiting for that moment to make their move on you... it probably wouldn't go down very well. So, relax and take it easy today. Oh, and you should stop by the Yanshang Teahouse — I whipped up some treats especially for you. Not sweet ones, of course. Just the tiniest little hint of chili."
Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"In my line of work, combat skills are essential."
Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Sometimes, you have to strike hard and fast at just the right moment to expose the lies while avoiding any unwanted interference."
Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"Finding the truth might sound simple, but it takes perseverance to stick to the trail of clues and it takes strength to follow them deep into dangerous territory."
Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"I have long regarded you as my most important informant. Naturally, I need to be fully prepared to face whatever risks come with the final answer when you bring it to me. Come on, let's go get it!"
Yoimiya,Hello,"Welcome to Naganohara! My name is Yoimiya — just let me know if you need anything! We have Kushikatsu, Egg Roll... Wait, no, we're not a restaurant. We make fireworks! Like these, see? Sparkling, crackling, little fireworks~"
Yoimiya,Chat: Fireworks,"Fireworks are for now, but friends are forever."
Yoimiya,Chat: Telling Stories,"If we've got nothing else to do, why don't I tell you a story?"
Yoimiya,Chat: Goldfish,Have you ever kept goldfish as pets? They're very cute.
Yoimiya,When It Rains,"Ahh, the fireworks are going to get soaked! Let's find shelter, quick! Oh, we're not going to make it!"
Yoimiya,When It Snows,"Haha, watch me make a snowball... pew!"
Yoimiya,When the Sun Is Out,"Ah, this is great! I feel so relaxed all over, I could almost float away."
Yoimiya,When the Wind Is Blowing,The wind's so strong—! It's blowing my voice back at me—! Hahaha...
Yoimiya,Good Morning,"Ah... *yawns* Good morning. The morning air is the freshest. Come on, take a few extra breaths — it'll make you smarter~"
Yoimiya,Good Afternoon,"Time for lunch! ... Oh my, it's an egg with a double yolk. What wonderful luck!"
Yoimiya,Good Evening,"Now's the best time to test our fireworks out, though I'm sure they'll look good whether they explode in the sky or on the ground... Hehe, just kidding. I'll pay attention to safety."
Yoimiya,Good Night,"Question time! So, what should you do after watching fireworks all day? Hehe, the answer is... to watch them again in your dreams, of course! Good night. See you tomorrow!"
Yoimiya,About Yoimiya: Family Matters,"My father's hearing isn't very good. When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him."
Yoimiya,About Yoimiya: Talking Friendship Lv. 4,"I don't worry about ""loose lips sinking ships."" The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie. Misunderstandings that arise from saying things wrongly can be resolved if you just talk more, but if you say nothing, the other person won't understand what you mean, and they can't get closer to you."
Yoimiya,"About Us: Rock, Paper, Scissors","Let's have a game of rock paper scissors! On my count, now — rock, paper, scissors! Woohoo, I won! I won! ... Hmm? I didn't change my choice halfway. Why would I ever do that?"
Yoimiya,About Us: Companionship Friendship Lv. 6,"It actually doesn't matter what I do. What matters are the people I work with. When I'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. Talking to you never gets old, after all."
Yoimiya,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon."
Yoimiya,Something to Share: Lantern Rite,"Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?"
Yoimiya,Something to Share: Cycles,"""When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence."" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite."
Yoimiya,Something to Share: Spots of Light,"Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, ""Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on..."
Yoimiya,Interesting Things,"While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the ""Goldfish Fireworks"" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease."
Yoimiya,About Beidou Friendship Lv. 4,"Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise."
Yoimiya,About the Raiden Shogun Friendship Lv. 4,"Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the ""eternity"" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has ""eternity"" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty."
Yoimiya,About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness Friendship Lv. 4,"We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word ""ladylike"" was practically made just for her."
Yoimiya,About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths Friendship Lv. 4,"We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths."
Yoimiya,About Thoma Friendship Lv. 4,"He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle."
Yoimiya,About Yae Miko Friendship Lv. 4,"Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, ""isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?"" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?"
Yoimiya,About Arataki Itto: Duels Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?"
Yoimiya,About Arataki Itto: Arataki's Gang Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?
Yoimiya,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4,"People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure."
Yoimiya,About Kujou Sara Friendship Lv. 4,"Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!"
Yoimiya,About Sayu Friendship Lv. 4,"Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!"
Yoimiya,About Klee Friendship Lv. 4,"Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?"
Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: I,"You wanna hear a story? Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of — the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?"
Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Our family has a long tradition in which we will give every client who orders customized fireworks a note. Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note."
Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: III Friendship Lv. 4,The loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.
Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity."
Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: V Friendship Lv. 6,"I shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course. On the contrary, I believe that our story is only just beginning."
Yoimiya,Yoimiya's Hobbies: Playing,"Fireworks! Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie. I like to chat with the neighbors, I like going to summer festivals with the children, swimming, picking wild fruits... Oh, I can't decide which I like most... Wait, I've got it! I love playing with everyone!"
Yoimiya,Yoimiya's Hobbies: Copycat,*Blubbering noises* Hah! I'm copying the sound that Paimon makes while disappearing!
Yoimiya,Yoimiya's Troubles,"The novel that I've been reading for a while finally reached its end. But the heroine lost her memory, and the planned wedding fell through... That's so... sad..."
Yoimiya,Favorite Food,"I prefer snacks to entrees. I always go from stall to stall during festivals, eating as I go. By the way, are you any good at making snacks? I'll trade the dango I made with you. Here, have the big ones!"
Yoimiya,Least Favorite Food,"Ugh... Milk never fails to start some real fireworks in my stomach — crackle, kaboom! Y'know what I mean? But I can handle dishes and snacks made with milk for some reason, hmm. Maybe the little Seelie in my stomach is just pickier than most."
Yoimiya,Receiving a Gift: I,"Wow, you've got a real knack for making tasty treats! You should totally set up a stall at a festival some time, oh it'd be a hit for sure!"
Yoimiya,Receiving a Gift: II,"Good food really perks you up, and puts you in the mood to share some stories. Ooh, actually I got a good one, you've gotta hear this one...!"
Yoimiya,Birthday,"Birthdays are never occasions for yourself alone. Those who send you cakes, light candles, applaud, and cheer... They are all truly thankful that you were born into this world. That's why it must be a lively occasion, so that everyone can get their chance to thank you! Well then — happy birthday! Are you ready? I'm about to ignite the fireworks!"
Yoimiya,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"The higher they fly, the louder the explosion!"
Yoimiya,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"Hehehe, let me give this ""shooting fireworks straight into the skies with a bow"" business a shot!"
Yoimiya,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"With all these combat skills I've learned from you, I should just become an adventurer on the side — apart from my day job making fireworks... Or... should I just become a hero instead?"
Yoimiya,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"""Never fear, Yoimiya is here! Evil begone! Justice prevails!""Think this is a good way to introduce the powers you've taught me to the children? Isn't it cool? Hehe! Hey, tell me if anyone picks on you, too. I'll stick up for you!"
Yun Jin,Hello,"As the saying goes, you never truly know someone until you meet them in person, and at long last, I finally have the great honor of meeting you today. My name is Yun Jin, and I am humbled to be the director of of the Yun-Han Opera Troupe. We have been performing at Heyu Tea House as of late, and we'd be honored to have you attend a performance sometime."
Yun Jin,Chat: Sensitive Topic,My waistband has been feeling a little snug these last couple of days... Methinks I perchance have overindulged...
Yun Jin,Chat: Relaxing,"Ahhh... Yes, I shall spare myself the hair and makeup routine today, and happily idle my time away!"
Yun Jin,Chat: Singing Opera,"(Translated) How gently do the clouds and flowers sway, as dancing winds meander through the vales.(Actual Voice-Over: 云婵娟来花婵娟，风流尽在山水间。)Actual Romanization: Yún chánjuān lái huā chánjuān, fēngliú jǐn zài shānshuǐ jiān."
Yun Jin,When Thunder Strikes,"*gasp* D—Did you hear that? Whew, it really startled me."
Yun Jin,When It Snows,"(Translated) Fie! This cold shall be mine end!(Actual Voice-Over: 喂呀，冻煞我了。)Actual Romanization: Wèi ya, dòng shā wǒ liǎo."
Yun Jin,When the Sun Is Out,"What a sight to behold, the sun so warm and radiant..."
Yun Jin,Good Morning,"Good morning! The dew at dawn is perfect for brewing tea, so I made some for you. Drink up, and then we'll head off!"
Yun Jin,Good Afternoon,I'd like to indulge in a nap after lunch. Oh? ...You're not tired?
Yun Jin,Good Evening,"Let's go listen to tonight's storytelling performance together. Liu Su's rendition of ""Ring of Raining Blades"" is most sublime!"
Yun Jin,Good Night,"There's a chill in the air tonight, so you mustn't stay out late. Good night!"
Yun Jin,About Yun Jin: Schooling,"My schooling started very early. In fact, my earliest memories are of my father teaching me to read. Despite my best efforts, my ability is not half of his. Enough to write operas, but compared to his level of erudition, I still have much to strive for."
Yun Jin,About Yun Jin: Opera Training,"In her youth, my mother was a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, and I learned all the operas I know from her. But, you could never imagine how strict she was with me as a teacher. Thinking back on it now, I... *sigh* No, no, no, I'd rather not think about it at all."
Yun Jin,About Us: Opera Troupe,"We have some grand performances coming up soon, and it just so happens that we have an opening for someone to play the part of a skilled swordfighter. I think you'd be a perfect match for the part. How about it? Would you like to join our troupe? We can even enjoy some tea together between acts."
Yun Jin,About Us: Rock 'n' Roll Friendship Lv. 6,"Huh? You like rock 'n' roll? Oh, that's great! I'll be sure to bring you along the next time I go out to see a show. And when I get back, I can just tell the senior troupe members that I went out to visit you... Hehe, that way, they won't have any reason to get on my case about going out."
Yun Jin,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Hmm? My Vision? Hehe, I suppose the Lord of Geo must be a fan of the opera. Perhaps the old man was so delighted with my performance that he decided to grant me a Vision."
Yun Jin,Something to Share: Drinks,"One of my absolute favorite pastimes is trying out all kinds of new beverages. I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with — you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?"
Yun Jin,Something to Share: Dreams,"Sometimes, I just feel like casting off my opera costume and going traveling overseas. You know, to explore the outside world. For now, I'll need to keep working hard at what I'm doing, so someday that dream can come true."
Yun Jin,Interesting Things,The chirping of the songbirds at daybreak always puts me in the best of moods.
Yun Jin,About Xinyan Friendship Lv. 4,"The elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. ""It's for your own good,"" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that."
Yun Jin,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,"Ah yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too — you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around."
Yun Jin,About Zhongli Friendship Lv. 4,"The customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?"
Yun Jin,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4,The Tianquan is a big spender and has made several very generous donations to our troupe. I can only return her generosity by delivering my best possible performance.
Yun Jin,About Xingqiu Friendship Lv. 4,"Oh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you."
Yun Jin,About Shenhe Friendship Lv. 4 The Crane Returns on the Wind,"I have long since known ""The Divine Damsel of Devastation"" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the ""divine damsel"" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again."
Yun Jin,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4,"I have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry."
Yun Jin,About Kaedehara Kazuha Friendship Lv. 4,"Kaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!"
Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: I,Many of the operas we've been performing recently are new ones that I wrote after assuming the directorship of the troupe. I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.
Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Per the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves."
Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: III Friendship Lv. 4,"At the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again."
Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: IV Friendship Lv. 5,"Now that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life."
Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: V Friendship Lv. 6,"Well you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be ""The Divine Damsel of Devastation,"" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you."
Yun Jin,Yun Jin's Hobbies,"My hobbies? Well, opera, of course! It's what I truly love and it's what I will be pursuing for the rest of my life."
Yun Jin,Yun Jin's Troubles Friendship Lv. 6,"*sigh* Well, as you can probably imagine, I always have to be mindful of what I eat and make sure I stay in shape. It's a shame, because the temptation to indulge in all the tasty delicacies the city has to offer is just as strong to me as to anyone else..."
Yun Jin,Favorite Food,"Tianshu Meat, Black-Back Perch Stew, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot... Oh, I just want them all! Unfortunately, I basically never get to eat such things, but... um, if you don't mind me asking... Can you cook any of those dishes?"
Yun Jin,Least Favorite Food,"Every day's the same... Stir-Fried Shrimp, day in and day out. No matter how they prepare it, it always tastes the same. Ugh, ghastly! I really can't stand it anymore..."
Yun Jin,Receiving a Gift: I,Mmm! There's no better feeling than indulging in your favorite food... It's a shame that I can only afford to have a little bite.
Yun Jin,Receiving a Gift: II,"Oh, what a magnificent feast! Wait a second, I'll grab us some drinks to accompany the meal."
Yun Jin,Receiving a Gift: III,I'm sorry... This meal isn't really agreeing with me.
Yun Jin,Birthday,"Oh, so today's your birthday? Well, I wouldn't know how to throw you a feast if I tried... so how about I sing you a song? For you alone, an audience of one. So... what song would you like to hear me sing? The choice is yours."
Yun Jin,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"As the saying goes: ""Achievement in a field is the result of how hard you are willing to work at it, not how much you enjoy it."
Yun Jin,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,It looks like all my rigorous training is finally paying off.
Yun Jin,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I began my training in the art of the spear hoping to enhance my performance in stage combat. I stuck with it hoping to master the techniques of self-defense. Today, it looks like I have finally achieved both of these goals."
Yun Jin,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"The art of the spear is a vast and profound discipline... There is an almost infinite number of things one can learn. I am glad to have had you by my side during my training. Haha, I believe I've grasped the basics now. I daresay you'd better be careful when we're sparring together in the future."
Zhongli,Hello,"A new contract? Okay. I'm still on leave, but I can accompany you for a while. What name should I use on the contract? I have a great many names, though when on leave... I tend to go by Zhongli. And you, Traveler? What name will you be signing on this contract?"
Zhongli,Chat: Journeys,Every journey has its final day. Don't rush.
Zhongli,Chat: Tours,"Where do you want to go next? If you'd like to see Liyue's tourist spots, I have a few references."
Zhongli,Chat: Liyue,"Boats are made for transferring commodities back and forth, and those that come across Liyue tend to stay a while, so it is where many things come to settle."
Zhongli,Chat: Reminiscing,Osmanthus wine tastes the same as I remember... But where are those who share the memory?
Zhongli,After the Rain,"Violetgrass is a plant that enjoys a moist environment and is best picked after it rains. If you should choose to pick any, be sure to store them appropriately."
Zhongli,When It Snows,"We should look for a place to take shelter. I'll be fine, but we don't want you catching a cold."
Zhongli,When the Wind Is Blowing,This weather is no good for being on vacation. We should go and take in an opera.
Zhongli,Good Morning,I hope today too shall be prosperous.
Zhongli,Good Afternoon,Want a quick meal to pick us back up? I know a good place in Chihu Rock.
Zhongli,Good Evening,"By this time of night, we will have already missed Ms. Yun's play, but Liyue is full of interesting places to explore, even at night."
Zhongli,Good Night,The market is closed and the port has settled. Go get some rest.
Zhongli,About Zhongli A New Star Approaches,"Nothing can be accomplished without rules or standards. No matter if it is mortals or adepti, everyone has their place. This rule keeps Liyue in peace."
Zhongli,About Us: Gold,Gold is Liyue's treasure. It is the blood that runs through her heart. As for whether your own heart shines like gold — we will have to wait and see.
Zhongli,About Us: Contracts Friendship Lv. 6 A New Star Approaches,"You and I have a contract, so feel free to discuss anything at all within the scope of said contract."
Zhongli,About Us: Fairness Friendship Lv. 6,"We can discuss matters that fall outside of our contract too. After all, I have been on this land for a time, and have come to know a thing or two. Of course, I do hope you can do some things for me as well. That would only be fair."
Zhongli,About Us: Confusion Friendship Lv. 6,"Contracts cannot be used to define friendship, nor measure sentiment. So just what can we use to measure the weight of our emotions? Do you know the answer, friend?"
Zhongli,About the Vision Friendship Lv. 4,"Visions... are also a type of contract. You should know that all power comes at a price. For every bit of power you gain, so too do you gain more responsibility."
Zhongli,Something to Share,"Trade relies on both contracts and fairness. There is one thing you must never forget when making and abiding by a contract: if fairness is lost, then the contract shall become proof of one's deception."
Zhongli,Interesting Things,"If you're heading to Jueyun Karst, please bring me back a bunch of Qingxin. Just one bunch is enough. Travel expenses... Ah, I almost forgot, during the effective period of our contract, travel expenses are to be paid for by yourself. Sorry to bother you."
Zhongli,About Xiao Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"You speak of the young adeptus of Guili Plains... *sigh* Still fulfilling his duty to this very day. Please give these Remedium Tertiorum to him on my behalf. Oh, yes — be sure not to let Paimon eat them. Nothing of this world can withstand the power of this medicine.(Actual Voice-Over: You speak of the young adeptus of Guili Plains... *sigh* Still fulfilling his duty to this very day. Please give these painkillers to him on my behalf. Oh, and — be sure not to let Paimon eat them. Nothing of this world can withstand the power of this medicine.)"
Zhongli,About Venti Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Tsk... It reeks of wine. That bard has just been through here, hasn't he? That drunkard is a disgrace to the arts. Oh... Has he tricked you into getting drunk? You're slurring a little. Wait a moment, I'll brew a pot of sobering tea. It'll be ready in only six hours, so just wait a moment."
Zhongli,About Ningguang Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Despite the multitude of affairs she deals with in a day, Ningguang always continues to press on. A rare gem indeed. I'm reminded of the time that she used to walk barefoot from Yaoguang Shoal to the south wharf, trying to sell her wares as she went. Time is cruel to humans."
Zhongli,About Hu Tao Friendship Lv. 4,The current overseer of the funeral parlor? Ahem. I cannot deal with that child.
Zhongli,About Tartaglia: Composed Friendship Lv. 4,"That rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? No matter, just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.(Actual Voice-Over: That rascal from Snezhnaya has yet to depart from Liyue? Heh, no matter, just let me know if he gives you any trouble. I shall deal with the matter swiftly.)"
Zhongli,About Tartaglia: Drinks Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"It's said that Childe and his reputation have yet again stirred up waves among the inner-ranks of the Fatui. Knowing his type, he will be sure to swiftly depose anyone who dares to challenge his actions. Hm... Come to think of it, there will be a lot of interesting news to be heard the next time we gather for drinks. Care to join me when the time comes, Traveler?"
Zhongli,About Ganyu Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on Rex Lapis' oracles or wisdom, it is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time. If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval."
Zhongli,About Keqing Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"She is the most impious of the Qixing — but I actually find the conviction of such people quite endearing. The only reason I was able to consider taking a step back from such overarching management of Liyue was because there are people like her. People who speak up when they believe themselves to be right, and then go and do something decisive about it."
Zhongli,About Yanfei Friendship Lv. 4 A New Star Approaches,"Despite never having signed a contract with me, she upholds order within many strata of Liyue society in her own way, dispelling misconceptions and correcting biases... Should her father one day return from his travels, I imagine that he would be even more delighted than I."
Zhongli,About Baal Friendship Lv. 4,"Time tempers all volition. Yet she would give up everyone for her beliefs. Perhaps it is for this very reason that she has come to where she stands today... Should the chance come by me, I too would like to learn of the Eternity for which she so earnestly endeavors."
Zhongli,"About Buer Friendship Lv. 4 Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises","As well as ruling over all of Sumeru, the God of Wisdom, Buer, has a duty to guard Irminsul. Only one who possesses great wisdom could hope to shoulder these responsibilities. All life in Teyvat owes her gratitude for saving Irminsul."
Zhongli,More About Zhongli: I,"Why is it that, once you finally get a break, rather than taking a rest, you instead come to me? Is it that you want to hear one of my stories?"
Zhongli,More About Zhongli: II Friendship Lv. 3,"Have you heard of the origin of the Blackcliff Forge? In the past, they would mine the ore veins of Mt. Tianheng, and then replace the cavities with factory equipment. Tunnels run in all directions throughout the mountain — some even run to the ruins deep within the earth. I doubt there is a person today who could map out all the tunnels."
Zhongli,More About Zhongli: III Friendship Lv. 4,"Have you heard of the origins of the Lantern Rite? In a war, long ago, the people of Liyue would release lanterns to remind their soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves. Though in this day and age, I doubt there are any that remember."
Zhongli,More About Zhongli: IV Friendship Lv. 5 A New Star Approaches,"The God of Contracts. Have you heard of him? He has an impressive memory. He remembers the name of every person he comes across, and the date that every ship in Liyue sets sail. After all, only in being able to do so can he memorize all of the contracts he holds. With that said, not every memory is a happy one..."
Zhongli,More About Zhongli: V Friendship Lv. 6 A New Star Approaches,"For those that live too long, the friends of days gone by and scenes from their adventures live on in their memories. As such I have no regrets in meeting you, friend. Should the day ever come that we are not together, you will continue to shine like gold in my memories."
Zhongli,Zhongli's Hobbies,I enjoy partaking in walks through the city — when time permits. I find it very calming. Yes... Just when did this feeling begin...?
Zhongli,Zhongli's Troubles,"To get people to abide by a contract, and act in accordance with the guidelines set out within, is simply to ask them to respect the concept of fairness. It is not a large request. How are there those who still do not understand such simplicity?"
Zhongli,Favorite Food,There was once a drink I used to enjoy with friends — long ago... Is it because the climate has changed? A shame I will never be able to relish in its smooth flavor again.
Zhongli,Least Favorite Food,"I don't like seafood. Just seeing it reminds me of that... slimy texture, and that scent that just won't wash off. As for why I hate it... *sigh* It's a long story, so let's just say my memory is a little too good."
Zhongli,Receiving a Gift: I,The finest ingredients cooked with true expertise. This is no small feat.
Zhongli,Receiving a Gift: II,The art of gastronomy is a fascinating one. That it appeals to you comes as no surprise.
Zhongli,Receiving a Gift: III,"Since you seem to have some time on your hands, why don't we find a quiet place and I'll share one of my stories with you."
Zhongli,Birthday,"Happy Birthday. This is a dried glaze lily that came into bloom on the day of your birth. Long ago, the people of Liyue would say that this flower blooms bearing the weight of the beautiful memories and prayers of the land. I believe this to have been applied on the day you were born as well."
Zhongli,Feelings About Ascension: Intro Ascension Phase 1,"It seems my strength is returning. Not a lot, but enough."
Zhongli,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up Ascension Phase 2,"My power is growing, and so with it grows the burden on my body... I'm okay. My structure is not the same as that of normal people. Please do not worry yourself."
Zhongli,Feelings About Ascension: Climax Ascension Phase 4,"I see. Using a Vision harnesses elements. As far as the common folk are concerned, this is no small feat. So... back then.. they were aware of this as they stood beside me..."
Zhongli,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion Ascension Phase 6,"After letting go of my Gnosis I never expected to see a day like this again. Thank you, friend. Ah, yes, I have a new contract here. Care to take a look at it together?"
