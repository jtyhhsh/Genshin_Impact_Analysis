Hoyovorse did you make genshin or am I imagining this game?,5
This game is so cool but it is too big,5
This game is awesome. This game is perfect for people who like adventure and exploring. It is also kind of challenging and gets harder as you level up in rank.,5
Cool,3
"Great game,but sometimes bugs don't let me enter it says wait for the developer update with the bug fixes thingie",4
Reminds me of Zelda but more...,5
"Couldnt even start playing. After the cutscene with traveller and paimon, I couldnt even move! Then the sound of the ringing kept replaying and reloading. Deleted most apps for genshin and couldnt play. The traveller and paimon cutscene was laggy, while the starting point was fine. The game said I was at about 263(?). Im pretty sure it was my device but I had 10GB. Hope I can play soon.",2
nice game,5
"I like the game the characters, the lore but my only problem is everytime i use ayakas auto attacks it glitches",2
"Love it so much I don't know how this is free to play!!!! Really fun to play, but there's a problem. I delete some stuff so I can install the stuff once it's downloaded, I delete beyond enough stuff to download the stuff, and then it says that I don't have enough space! Maybe try fixing that problem to bump up my review, also it is the most biggest game file ever so I recommend having alot of space on your device, please make it to where it isn't such a huge game file, thank you!",4
"It's the best I've ever played! I totally love it and it kinda fits cause I love views so everywhere I go and I think it's cool or beautiful I just GOTTA picture it heh.. yes, the graphics are more beautiful and better on pc [ I do play on pc aswell ] but I still don't have any problems with playing on my phone I'd say it's the best game I've EVER played and I'm so happy with it! And the Winblume's Breath?! AWESOME! I LOVE THE SONGS SOOO MUCH I DON'T WANT THEM GONE! I totally recommend! ^^",5
good,5
Fan of legend of zelda both so nice,5
Dear Genshin Impact.... I need so much storage to play this game i need 19 gb of memory can you lower the storage needed like 10 gb to play so people can play it i already share it with my friends but we dont have space but the graphics is good tho Hope you read this.......,5
we need this game on xbox console,3
"After the new double rerun banner, I think this is a huge quality of life. All the other people who constantly complaining about everything about the game is just brainless. Why I change my opinion on this game is that I can see that this is going in a right direction for the game. All the reviews that is 1 star is probably just people who want to get more out of the game. They lose 50/50, oh the system sucks, didn't get the artifact they want, oh the game sucks. Grow up people.",5
Soo good I spent all my time on there and it was so worth it,5
To much updates.,3
"I liked this game overall, graphics, story and characters. But one thing is the resin system. Waiting for 8 minutes for 1 resin to reset? Not very satisfactory. 160 resin is the limit? can't increase? A lot of players has been struggling with the resin system. Can't it increase?",2
Great game but needs controller support on Android. It's been way too long.,2
This game is good and nice play,5
Will do anything to play genshin lol but I have to wait and buy a PlayStation bcus of the amount of storage this game takes up,2
"Great game, But please give more free roll🤣",5
"This game is great Bayside the toxic community and my only problem is the logo , I just hope they change it to something more afficial !",5
After trying every RPG game I finally found the perfect one! This is the best game I've ever experienced in my life!,5
"When i tried this game its so awesome the graphics and the map and the characters and the citys they are so stunning, i cant wait to see the next update on 3.5",5
"Nice game, but this is more of a benchmark game than an actual game to be played on your phone. You're much better playing this game on PC instead. Now for the game itself, a lot of good but some pretty bad thing that will drive you away. The worst is the pulls and artifact RNG and how whales are infinitely luckier than the rest. Other than that, this game is a must try.",5
The game is soooooooo good but it takes alot of space it takes 20g but I want you to install it.,4
I love all the of the gameplay,5
This game is not good it won't let me play the game I hate this,1
THISSSSSSSSSSEE GAMMMME ISS THEEE WORSST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant even play it! i didhit get to play the game!! You beter fixe this! The only thing it those is load after its done loading it chots of!!,1
Actual poggers,5
It now takes 20 GB and that's to much,1
Its a realy nice game the story line the graphics its just perfect!,5
"Please do something about the size, i still love the game and wanna play it but i can't i dont have enough storage anymore.",1
this game is very interesting in terms of graphics but it is also very boring :(,5
"In Iran we have problems with access to the google play, it's filter and updating the game through google has troubles ,,,",5
No controller support for Android!! iOS has controller support while Androids have been neglected. There's even a key binding option for contrllers that's blank because Androids can't play Genshin with controllers! I'll give this game 5 stars once an update reveals that Androids have controller support.,3
"I changed my review, it's a great game but still my luck is suck",4
"As an endgame player, there is little to do and quite a bit of it is tedious with a lot of room to optimize player experience. Unfortunately, instead of making more repeatable endgame content or giving the playerbase some substantial QoL improvements, they've decided to add subpar units that have buggy kits and do not add much (if any) value to your account while making the spiral abyss less and less accessible to players who don't have certain teams built. It's a beautiful shell of a game.",2
"I have no words, but its amazing.",5
"A lot of fun, amazing story, wonderful graphics, very good gameplay, best game ever for mobile and pc.",5
19.02.22 The game is good but whenever I play there are some red particles everywhere and there is this black rectangle in the middle of the screen The PC version is 5 stars. Im reinstalling because I want to give this game a second chance The newest 5 star character dehya is pretty bad when she does the same thing as xingqiu a 4* character from 2 years ago but worse. You need to spend £2k to get c6 r5 and even then she is comparable to a c0 hu tao with a 4* weapon dps wise. She needs a buff.,4
Sometimes it closes by itself,4
It suck because I can't get in to it to play,1
good game,5
It's amazing I love it so much,5
Don't play this game. It's not finished yet. It also fails at being a live service game (even thought it claims to be) because there's literally nothing to do past a certain point. This is my first and last real gacha game.,1
The best,5
I like it,5
"When I first downloaded the game in 2021 I thought it was too complicated, I didn't understand how it worked. But if I told myself two years ago I'm playing the game everyday, I would call myself delusional-",5
"Great game at start but don't have all the time in the world to play excessively like some players nor do I plan to spend money to get a character that would be beneficial for progressing because how long it takes to get through story to start quest to travel only to suffer because lack of quality items and characters. A friend recommended I try this game and not that easily impressed when it comes to games with gacha system. Guess as great as it starts out, I'll be deleting.",2
This Just is for Pc. Not worth to download on mobile. And 14 Gb Inner download. Before game start and Not that Cool. And multiplayer unlocks at 16 level and Intro of game is stuck,3
I like the girls,1
Niceeee graphics and the game I'll gived 5star,5
i love it more stressed relief,5
Nice,5
noice!!,5
THIS GAME IS SO GOOD BUT I GET A LITTLE BORED IF THERE IS NO MISSIONS CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO😅,4
One of the best I have ever played,5
The game is good but I hate the fact that if you want the wish you have to grind to wish and sometimes you get a Character you have and then you have to grind Again and to level up a Character you need certain stuff and sometimes your ar level is to low to get the stuff.,4
Suck,1
"Genshin Impact is a masterpiece even if you will not play the game you need to look at the musics, they are so good! But we need more male characters please make it even Mihoyo..",5
LOVE THIS GAMEE SO MUCHH🙌🙌🙌🙌,5
"Great game, but... 21Gb download on a mobile device seems excessive, and to make it worse they don't give ""on demand"" capabilities, so you are stuck with a 21Gb download with avg speed between 1 and 3.5 Mbps, this enough for most ppl to give up before even downloading half of it. If u can't keep game downloading after closing it down u must increase your mobile virtual memory page and close anything on background. Happy gaming.",4
Really good game but cost a lot of GBs,5
Why so susah nak dapat diluc,5
It's the best game 🎮,5
"best game I've ever played, literally",5
Very Gaa Y,5
This game is really good.,5
I found out that you can delete the additional files you no longer need after clearing the quests- which I did. But then I switched out to another account which is fairly new and it prompted me to download the files I've JUST DELETED. Logging out of that account to my main account won't even let me pass the download screen anymore! Can't you just make it optional to download the files when we ACTUALLY WANT to do the quests??,1
Love this game nice game play,5
Thrilling storyline and awesome gameplay...!!!,5
Nice,5
the game is amazing!! But there's one thing I have a problem why won't the game let me in?,4
I want to eat paimon✨✨✨,5
Nice art style,5
You're telling me that you send/post millions of ad's per year for a game about anime girl's? Also the game's slow.,1
Sukii‹³ love dis game fr,5
I so love game genshin lmpact,5
Ninguna se desnudo.,1
STOP WITH THE SETEKH WENUT,1
It keeps saying storage already getting multiple times clean my storage is not working fixes but it's annoying and got rid of half of my games,2
"Add controller support! I bought a backbone specifically for Genshin, only to find out its not supported! PLEASE ADD CONTROLLER SUPPORT!!! This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Will definitely change to 5 when this feature is added!",4
Best game ever,5
Love this game best open world I've played in a long time,5
i cool game and 3d moshan thes game good for rmdan,5
Best realistic game on Android,5
Best free world game,5
Nice,5
"i absoloutley ADORE genshin. ive been playing it on my ps4 ever since it came out, and ive always loved it. the regions are beautiful, the food looks absoloutley delicious, the character designs are amazing, and the map is absoloutley beautiful and stunning. the updates are always super fun, especially stuff like the golden archipelago (i think thats how it spelt 😭) in summer. i have zero complaints about genshin and i never will! 100% recommend!!",5
"Excellent game, very thoroughly developed, captivating fantasy world experience. So extensive, it must be more enjoyable on a game console rather than mobile phone.",5
Maha ghatiya itna khelne ke baad bhi dhokha de deti he ye game,1
I lov this game,5

"This game is overall okay, I have nothing else to say",4

Game crashed and restarted my phone when I was using auto dialogue I don't wanna use it now,4
"The ""Lost Key"" daily commission made me throw up.",1
Awesome but it is to hard to get characters,5
I CAN play this game in highest graphics 😎,5
"1gb game requires a 20gb download from some server in China. Yeah no, I'm not using a 3rd of my storage on one game. Bye",1
So far this is amazing But one thing Genshin plzz plz plz Add characters with Sythes Plz I will enjoy this game more if there are characters with Sythes plzz Add characters with Sythes it will be the best,4
"I loved this game so much. It gave me an experience of having fun. But the only problem is that it become much boring and that after the pandemic ended and our quarantine ended, I couldn't play anymore. I had more things to do and suddenly the game added more quests. I'm really greatful for this game.",4
Fun Game 👍😊,5
Played it before and when I got it on my phone I tried to download the data witch I couldn't be cause it was over 20gb and I almost deleted all my game because of the game,1
Bennett c6 toggle,2

I love this game 💕✨,5
Çok iyi detayları harika 👍,5
"I really enjoy this game like a lot, but the issue was having an fps drop issues even tho my phone is made for gaming. And also I am too dumb to understand the whole story in this game like at first I get so bored but then when I played it I have nothing to say that I am getring addicted to it. I'll give this an 8/10 👍",5
awesome,5
"I like the game I've made quite a few friends with it,I have spent over 10000$ on it(c6 r5 hu tao,ayaka,Raiden,ganyu main)there's just a few problems with it",5
It's very fun ( ﾟーﾟ)( ＾ω＾ ),5
Wow this game is underrated,5
"This game is really fun the rewards aren't great, but I'm still greatful",3
Epik game,5
My kid got hit by a bus,1
The quality are so perfect and smooth experience!,5
"I played it for a day the next day the game froze and didn't even load, I decided to uninstall it and try again this time It only downloaded resources and stopped working I didn't even get to play the game this Time around",2
this abyss really sucks. please dont put wenut on 12F ever again,1
"Definitely recommended if ur into fantasy, fighting games. It's great and all but after you really get into the game it's all abt grinding to level up ur ar and etr. If you get bored of it I personally just don't play it for a few weeks but overall is an amazing game",4
Best game,4
this game makes me relaxed everytime im bored and it has cute and pretty characters and good graphics and the story line too i recommend this game for you if you want to install,5
Awesome 👍👍👍,5
This game is Super Duper awesomee,5
honestly the main quest is horrible cause of the automated animation and the outdated open world design. but the visuals and combat fun so alright,2
"Best game , deserves more than five stars",5
Fix dehya or refund my money,1
Delightful game,5
I hate this game. It took so long for me JUST FOR LOGIN? TO MY OWN ACCOUNT!? I'd give 1 star for that service. give my account back and i'll give u an 5/5 star! id really love this game since april 2021 but whyd i cant even login to my own account. Nahh it took me so long to login since 2022. I literally hate those login service,1
AMAZING,5
Trash game bare minimum satifastion over hard work.,1

I am a Huge fan of this game.Playing for few months.Reached AR35..Still waiting for a 5 star hero..I got it once (QIQI):(..That's fine..I know I will get a better one someday ..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO GAMERS AROUND THE WORLD..bcoz this hugeeee huge open world game with such amazing storyline is absolutely free...ONE REQUEST TO THE CREATORS..NEVER EVER ASK GENSHIN PLAYERS FOR MONEY...PLEASE KEEP THIS GAME FREE FOREVER.,5
Buff Dehya,1
Happy Anniversary! I would love to celebrate this Event properly with everyone,4
Love this game.. Just it's hard when the game ends. 🙂,4
"Its a great game with interesting storyline, great open world detail, good character design and game mechanic but when it comes to the white loading screen it hurt your eyes to the max when playing at night. 0/10 when it comes to white loading screen and we want dark mode for it.",5
"It was fun, but although I didn't get my fav character but it's okay!",5
I'm addicted to this game,5
Why should this game be online? When there is no communication with other players in the game? The game was deleted due to not having the attractions of an online game!,1
Very nice👍 game,5
"i did not have any problem before, but now for some reason the game doesnt work. it will just show the hoyoverse logo and then it will crash. i tried to clear data, clear cache, and reinstalling the app but it still doesnt work. this problem just appeared out of nowhere this afternoon, even though i have already opened and played the game earlier today. please help",2
Lack of endgame content which will make the game boring after you complete all the quest and you have to wait a month and half for the next story,3
Is a good open world rpg game better than any rpg game I've played definitely.,5
It is amazing but a ending should be easier for new players like me,5
The game is need a 20GB to download,2
Hoyo pls fix this bug or glitch whenever i click for the next dialouge it gets hang pls pls plss fix this,1
Its bad,2
Good game,5
"This game is getting boring. Movements, the lores and cut scenes angle are the SAME. Boring, boring, boring.",3
"This game is amazing and I'm really satisfied, but it takes a lot of memory",4
It's the only game I now play. It's wonderful,5
It's 2023 and still no control support. This game could be way better is android users had controller support. Really upsetting.,2
Give me vermillion. Maybe I can rate this 5 star. GIVE ME VERMILLION,1
Great game but I hate brain games . I deleted the game because of internet connection as it stopped me from using my lovely dendro Reactions . I don't know why but when I downloaded genshin my internet speed became 10x slower . When I deleted it it became normal again almost immediately ;,3
sexy is the best one,1
"I'm enjoying this game but it's a disgrace that after downloading 20gb Android users don't even get the benefit of being able to use a Bluetooth controller. In response to the developer's reply, obviously my feedback is to give Android users the ability to play with a Bluetooth controller. There's no acceptable excuse for why this option isn't available.",1
Im not play now.just how long to download the game,5
Its good,4
"What the actual H with new 12.3, you are making the abyss worse everytime, no fun to play it's always frustrating to wait for boss to spawn in abyss, 1 star until you fix abyss without any time waste bosses",1
I have 42 out of 73 gb what do you mean by insufficient storage space??,3
Buen juego,4
I am so addicted to this game it is so good,5
Yippiee,5
Ok,5
It's a very fun and relaxing game along with smooth combat but Wondering if you can make Bluetooth Xbox controller compatible to connect,5
"I installed it. Logged in. It's starting and it says ""Ensure sufficient space and try again"" I have 6.4 GB available.",1
best game i ever had,5
"Pretty good game, great design and storylines but after i stop playing this game for 2 months, the genshin is not playable on my device anymore, RealmeC15 is my device and when the new update play it always on 6-9 fps if i dont move it become 13fps, i hope the game do something about this i really want to play this game but i guess everytime it update it needed the better phone, also i did all the low graphics thing on settings and follow every instructions for fps drop fixing still 6-9fps 🥲",2
This is the best open world RPG game ever. And so many people like me always wished for a game like this,5
It keeps saying network error my internet is fine I can't even log in anymore this is bullsh*t,1
I am a new player in genshin impact the problem is the reason why I rate bcz when download it and started playing I reached to mondstadt but the problem is that there is no like what is the mark called location yellow thing I don't see it so I'm in big trouble so I got stuck in the mondstadt now I don't know where I will go I see everyone's location show them where to go but why not mine is it bcz I started this game lately or something I really wanna play it pls fix it if it has a problem pls😭,3
I love this game alot,5

Great story game play. Love it,5
"Best game ever! Just be careful, the game is free to play but you'll WANT to spend money lol",5
Since today everytime I open the app it crashes and nothing helps,3
Insanely Great!!!,5
Everything i want to experience is here...i love it.....,5
Your game is to good but one thing that can make your game even more better Please Add skip button😭,5
"HONESTLY, one of the best open-world games with actually mind blowing lore and combat. The characters are super detailed and amazing I wanna pull for all of them :') the storage might be a bit of an issue so try to stay away from mobiles if u have the option lol",5
This is Very Good Game,5
"Please make the voiceover language changeable per character wise. I would love to change few charecter voices to Japanese while others remain in English. Make the serenita pot and all of it's resources optional and deletable. Let us to delete female traveler's resources when playing as male. Make underground chasm deletable too when someone explored it 100%. Lastly, add pc like graphics settings like volumetric fog, reflection, resolution etc.",3
Cutie game 🎯,5
I will not give anything 5 stars,4
有bug，很严重的bug，游戏疯狂闪退,1
"So satisfied with the game, I just love the concept of the game, the Characters development never disappoint and they're all cute ❤️❤️ it's a game for me to cure Anxiety, stress, bad mood 😌 no bugs no issues I had face until now, game is Awesome 🔥",5
Happy,5
Amazing,5
perfection,5
First time playing I'm actually liking this game I didn't think I'd like it at first the story is going ok but I do wonder if they will drag the story line and hopefully find her brother asap,5
good story boards,5
Omg best game ever,5
I can't explain its just beautiful,5
I played genshin last month but i deleted it my adventure rank was already 27 but then I downloaded it again today and it just made a new account,1
Epic,5
It keeps on saying influent space I optimized my phone I updated my I Uninstalled & Installed the app.,1
Graphics are really good and the option to be able to use different characters helps bring a better spin to the game I really recommend this game. Well made,5
I love it,5
I love game,1
gg,5
Genshin impact 💯👍😱 I see app.,5
Funny thing is that you can get on a ps5,5
El mejor juego de la historia,5
Best gile x puas main 1 jam hahahahah 🤣🤣,5
SHENHE EARLY PITY PLEASE,5
Good game,5
It's like Overwatch,1
I try to open the game and it crashes instantly. I've been playing for years and have no clue what's causing this so suddenly,5
Everything is fine except I never have enough space for the updates. Also the game takes up all my space. Also can u add abandon quest cause I'm stuck on trails in Tianqiu.,3
Full 16GB download 😅,2
Why do I lose my progress anytime I get a new phone and log in I will try changing servers but my data progress won't be anywhere to find,4
idk,5
I don't have enough space for my phone and I do imma give it 1 star,1
"Very good looking for a mobile game, needs controller support because Apple products are not my thing.",1
"20,000 mb ???? Of a update download????",1
Easily my favourite game,5
"Another stupid boss that hides underground, invulnerable from all attack, I thought mihoyo doesn't want excessive anxiety",1
Gimme yae,1
Takes a long time for it to download but it's worth the wait,5
It's a cool ☺️,5
good game,5
"I think it's a bad game, bad rates; some of the worst on the market at a dismal 0.6%. Coupled with stingy free currency generation and expensive skins; it's a terrible combination for a game with terrible rates, you can expect to only see 2 five stars playing the game for an entire year. Most of the characters use the same base model with faces looking virtually the same; not a single one stands out or is appealling. Gameplay bland it's like a walking and talking simulator that gets old quickly",1
The best way to have 😊,5
Good,5
😃,5
"I hate it because of no skip button, I don't want to see the stories, I don't want to read the long dialogues because I don't want to waste my time, I could just watch the story on youtube.",1
Pls give me 5 star characters in the next banner,5
Good,5
"It's a great game, I really like the plot and character releases- I enjoy the game alot, but I was hoping for hoyoverse to give more primogems on longer and harder quests, especially with puzzles. There are quests that I find hard and too long for just 60 primogems. I find it hard to earn primogems once you reach high AR.",4
My best game In my life,5
Love it but I need more colored ppl! ♡♡,5
Great game keep it up,5
gebshin,5
"Takes 1,000000000000 mlinon years to download",1
Plsssss give zhongli a skin and make an artifact for his shield and his geo damage or for just his hp and his shield strength,1
Excellent!,5
"It says theres a bug everytime i try to open genshin and its not letting get in at all, pls fix this bug, i tried resetting and deleting the app but its not working... It was fine yesterday so idk why its acting up now...",1
Playing 2 years now and AR 58 and I still love this game I play it everyday its like my safe place I just hate losing my 50/50 LOOOL,5
Fix Dehya,1

I hate the new Abyss update.,1
It would not let me play on my phone is this on PC to?,1
"I just want to play the game mostly, and it kind of bothers me that there is no skip button for the cut scenes.",4
"it's a really good game I love it, its the best luv the game!",5
"The game is amazing, the graphics are amazing and the storyline is sad but nice at the same time the music is peaceful and the characters designs are perfect maybe sometimes it will glitch but most times it doesn't I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play with friends.The events are so cool to.😃",5
"Great gameplay, story, graphics and characters though it is very hard to obtain 5-star characters and weapons. Really looking forward to the rest of the storyline yet to be released.",5
I will never forgive what this game did to Dehya.,1
It is really very special 🥰🥰🥰😀😀😋😋,5

Best Open World RPG Game I Have Played So Far,5
I don't understand how to play,3
Awesome!!!😁,5

Dude it's been like more than 2 years ...and still the artifact system sucks 🐸🐸,2
Superb gaming experience on Android,5
"Toooooo many updates And there is no way to skip them I don't play a lot and anytime I want to paly, I have to dl another update It's so annoying",3
Best RPG game in the world,5
I LOVE IT SO MUCH I PLAY IT ALL DAY EVERY DAY,5
Best game I have ever played on a cellphone!,5
After you download this game for the first time...all you have to know is you are gonna stuck in this game cuz waifus and husbandos in this game are so fricking cute and handsome,5
TRASH 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮,1
👍,5
Very good game but takes 14gb space i know that it has great graphics and gameplay thats the reason for the space issue but still people with 32 gb memory has to suffer :( same with 64gb but slightly better :( :\,5
It's best game i ever played It's character design is awesome Hope it's don't take too much storage,5
Hacked....... Sed lyfe,1
"The game is alright but i can't understand why it never loads when I'm using mobile data??? Like i use the same mobile to watch videos stream music or literally do anything else but whenever i try to play genshin it gets stuck after the loading screen, and the screen remains white for a few minutes and then the game tells me the session logged out and i need to restart the game",1
Having fun,5
If you don't want to spend money don't get this game. That's all.,5
good,5
It's a very good game,5
This video is sponsored by genshin impact,5
Trash,1
"genshin is a great game! you can battle, do quests, and you can even gacha for new and amazing characters! but if you have enough storage, get it",5
AMAZING THANK YOU 😊🙂🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩,5
What a good game🥰,5
"Amazing game....one of the best, if not the best RPG games ever..",5
beautiful visuals and graphics,5
It doesn't download any data it always says i don't have enough space storage i actually deleted most of my apps and make lot of space storage but it didn't work at all i am trying to do it from last 2 years but still it's results are same .,1
di ko din alam,4
"This game is fantastic on PC. It's hot garbage on mobile. The camera control is almost non-existent, you'll constantly hit the wrong thing on the touch interface, and swapping characters without using your burst is a gamble. The fact that this game is this old and still lacks controller support is absolutely ridiculous.",3
I can't play this game it tells me I need to log in again and again ughhhhhhhhh I can't play it,1
It's the best game I have played ever.,5
I like the game it's fun And relaxing.,5
i freaking i love the game......just so annoyed some the balloon delivery or the fix the balloon,5
Really good open world gacha game with a great story.,5
E for excellent and everyone,5
Absolutely adore this game and hope that one day it will be available on nintendo switch because playing on a phone is not the same experience. The only thing stopping me from a 5 stars is the conversations with NPCs they end after every questions and if you have up to 3 choices of questions you have to click on tbe character again and restart the conversations from the beginning. It would be great if once the question is answered it goes back to the original script rather than closing.,4
Taking one star. Cause my game keeps crashing. I can just be exploring or in a battle nd it just gives up. Am playing on a revvl 6 5g. I still love the game but it's just this one thing that makes me mad..and mostly sad cause I do like this game. Am editing it again cause it keeps crashing I don't have many apps on my phone but dude come on why ??? Does this game do that ! Fix it or make not crash cause it is bull. I don't want to delete the game but I will cause the crashes do hurt me.,2
its a perfect game,5

"Hoyoverse , Of you are reading this...... GIVE FREE PRIMOGEMS ( OR GENESIS CRYSTAL any one you like) Please for the love of God do it thnx",5
very nice game,5
your pc version doesnt work well :(,1
"Awful, no support for a controller. Edit: after that pointless developer response if I could leave a review for less than one star I would do. Save the effort and use add basic features to your game, you realise its 2023 and not 2013 right?.",1
Bring me to this world and give me overpower the,5
Graphics is good,5
"Sick character design wasted on horrible kits. Especially at the time of release. Surely they won't repeat zhongli's case, right? Nevermind, they did WAY worse with kokomi and dehya's release. You might appreciate the aesthetic, visuals, and story of this game but gameplay is mid. Sorry",1
stupidest game ever,1
Too big for mobile pls do version for mobile,4
It's so good app,5
Disappointed at the new character banner,3
AMAZING,5
"I love this game so much, this is my favourite game yet so far. But I deleted it, but don't worry I will redownload it again.",5

give more primos so i can make it 5☺️,4
It's so cool👍,5
Are we ever going to get controller support for android...,2
The game is excellent to play but after recent updates game lags a lot it was never smooth after that. I hear audios even before everything I interact. Does anyone face the same issue like mine kindly tell me a solution.,3
The graphics and the animation I like that we can go out and explore on like the other games,5
Nice game,5
Great game if you like story and lots of drama. Plot and idea is amazing. My only complain is the cost for wishes. They are 160 maybe 100? It's because when you grind you usually have to spend hours for a 10 pull. At least we can save some time and p2w have it easy compared to the f2p like me. Please add this and this is something that could possibly help the game.,4
Buff Dehya,1
"I liked playing it a lot it's a interesting game i don't have any complaints it has a interesting story and good fights and your able to explore and the character designs are amazing and i also like the voice acting it doesn't only show the words of the characters but each character has a different voice they also have a verity of weapons swords,bow and arrow,cattilist users and more and each place has different enemies there's also good descriptions on the characters.",5
"Please me a 5 star character, but not qiqi",5
Good game but the loading screen when u first download it was to long make it shorter,4
It's amazing honestly,5
I'm inlove just I still don't get the artifacts 🥹,5
Farming good artifacts is HELL ! No wonder why so many player left. Atleast 1 good item for 2 session of farming at the same domain,1
game yahudi,1
I've been playing for a month and tbh the game was so fun I had to quit this time bc it is prohibited in our religion since genshin contains worshipping gods so I'll just wait for honkai star rail. This game gave me good memories it. Tbh this is one of the best game I ever played but goodbye and can't wait for honkai star rail.,5
This is one of the best game I really like it .,5

"Love this game so much! Every character's perosnalities and back stories are all relatable, game graphics and details are so wonderful, and the music every nation day and night are relaxing!! This game is just, perfect. My suggestions are the features for co-op mode, please add voice chat, it will help a lot of players to communicate with other people or even by their friends, and if possible, can you add PvP? Thankyou!❤️",5
It's a great game but please increase load on the teapot i can't put more furnishing on it because of the limit on android.,4

I like the game very much but it would be nice if the game let me download and play stories part by part and let me delete what I have finished so that it wouldn't take so much storage cause 20 gb for a game is alot .,4
Game is good but dehya is below avg worst character ever made,5

Sangat bagus,4
So friking amzinnnnnnngggg,5
Child preds play this,1
Yea I love everything about the game except for the devs giving thousands of free Primogems to streamers and not their regular players just because we aren't playing it on camera. Blatant favoritism from the devs and I will not play until they change that!,1
"it's a fantastic game, but now i can't play cuz my device spec is no longer supported the game🥲 so sad it's become too lagging when playing even using the lowest quality. but i always support this game😁😁",5
noice,5
"The customer service is terrible. My account was hacked and it is now forever lost. Its a good game but man, the company is a disappointment. I wish I didn't spend so much time building my account. Edit: MiHoYo, I already tried contacting you several times. Despite having concrete evidence and people backing me up I was still rejected not once or twice but 4 times. It's pretty damn depressing. I will not change my rating until I actually DO get my account back.",1

"Untuk developer yang terhormat, Saya memiliki keluhan mengenai moonchase event ini, Cerita dan cutscene didalamnya sangat menarik dan bagus, tapi itu bukan berarti kalian bisa seenaknya menjatuhkan harapan player dgn mengganti deskripsi item moonlight talisman seenaknya. Penjelasan npc diawal juga bilang kita bisa menukarnya dgn berbagai hadiah. Kalian sudah berulangkali menyelenggarakan event seperti ini dan semuanya memuaskan, jadi kenapa?",4
"Playing for 2 years++, all I can say is the game was really good and will be better if you play through the story, lores, dialogues and scenery of the places. Top up not required but it's up to you, I love this game if there's 6 stars I'll rate it 7.",5

Can't download 😥,1
It's a good game overal the game play the music the sound effects the story line the characters all good just the storage (22+GB)on phone (70+GB on laptop/computer/pc) I honestly recommend you to play on a newer phone I played on a phone that launched during 2018 and it kept overheating and crashing. however when I played on a new phone it overheated a bit and as you progress the game slowly gets laggyer.,5
Love the game but would like controller support for the backbone on android thanks,5
Controller support please for backbone!,4
"Dialogue, dialogue and you know what. Yes, more dialogue.",1
Best game I ever played,5
What a game!!,5
The game is too large. And doesn't have support to be moved to external SD card.,1
"It's a great game, but you need A LOT of space for it. 25 total gb of space",5
Best Android open world game I'm ever played. Thank you so much for this💝✨,5
10 gb çöp yer israfı sadece,5
Amazing I love the game it has so mush design in it,5
Bro I deleted all of my apps including the important ones and my pictures I can never get back and it still said my storage was full and that I could not play until it was empty,1
Nice,5
The game is amazing to play but when you just want to take a break from the game like 3 days it starts over and you lose all progress in the game that sucks and a total waste of time...,1
I love it,5
Tgc tolol dadu gak pernah dikasih elem yang dicari,1
99999999999/10 it is awesome I love the game if u need action calm or challenging this is the game it is awsome!!,5
"This game has some very good things in it, like the art, world, and music. However, the devs constantly make very questionable decisions that actively go against player wishes. The newest character has a top tier design with a lot of fans. However, the reveal of her abilities and her showcase puts her in the bottom tier of all characters in playability. Players are begging Mihoyo to revisit her kit and give her some buffs, but they ignore this. Please fix your characters Mihoyo.",2
"Recently I started having problem in the game as it constantly crashing, please help",2
Fun af,5
DILUC IS ON TOP,5
"An amazing game experience,so many things to explore,i haven't had this much fun since a long time!!",5
"revive La Signora. Mihoyo Just doesn't care about players. even simple things like fixing extremely bright plain white loading screen that burned our eyes more than it did to phones AMOLED screens. fortunately I developed a habit of swiping down notification bar to cover loading screen whenever I teleport or enter a domain. I know how you will respond to this Mihoyo. so there's no need to break your keyboard keys( i.e CTRL, C, V).",1
"Worst gameplay experience ever. The game always disconnects from the server when I initiate Quests or confront obstacles, and then I have to restart the whole quest from the beginning. It's such a waste of time for a great game with good graphics and storyline.",1
Very good open world / story game Highly recommended!!! :D,5
Chưa biết chơi cái gì,5
"This game is incredible. High quality graphics for a 3d mobile game I must say. Very interesting story, awesome characters and Intriguing character lore. A solid gacha system. Once you figure it out its relatively manageable. Solid in-game currency. Very much obtainable. The fights can be extremely challenging at times. Overall this game lives up to the hype.",5
"It says I need more storage space. I have 8.14GB of free space. How much space does this game need to let me play it? Those options were definitely not given. Once downloaded, it wanted me to download even more after hitting start, and said there wasn't enough space, and to make sure and try again. Same thing over and over. I really want to play, but I think your game is too big for my phone.",1
J j,2
"I LOVE THIS GAME !! it is very funny and all of the characters are very interesting, Exploring and all the quests are also really fun !! I kind of got into an addiction of this game- The only problem I have is that it's kind of hard getting the characters I want but it's really fun grinding, sometimes- But I really recommend it definitely helps me with my anxiety and depression !!",5
Love it bruv,5
Cool,5
Osumm 💘💘💖💖💖,5
Great gacha game that doesn't require you to run meta characters. My only complaint is to add controller support for Android. That's the only think stopping me from getting back into the game. Other games have controller support on android.,3
Please make voice chat in game,5
I love the game it's just every time I get on after a few minutes the app just closes or takes me to another app on my phone. I wish somebody can fix this please?,4
i like it but i prefer dragon ball legends,1
One of the worst experiences I ever had,1
It's great I like the character design,5
I lovr itt,5

The game is good but its not optimised properly and it always lags and 1 and 2 two days when i started the game was working good and when i open the game in the 3rd day the the game was not loading and also the main thing is that storage problem and then i uninstalled the game problem plz fix this problem as soon as possible,4

Please consider fast ranking up,1
A really great game!,5
"Game is great! I just kinda don't like how much quests is there but alright. Gameplay is fun, scenery amazing characters as well. Also wishing system is kinda.. Well, hard to cope with but ok",5
Good game with amazing graphics and visual effects,5
"This game is Leagends of Zelda but done poorly because it takes weeks to even get anywhere, you need to grind for hours to get anything good, And the story just sucks I wouldn't spend any money on this game its not worth it Nor should you even think about Downloading it. Its just that bad",1
Lag and the size is big.delete,1
"This game promote pathological gambling, and the character's artstyle is just too sick. Beyond that the game is very repetitive and overall boring.. if you want to try it don't waste to much time or money because probably you'll regret it. Beware",1
"Wonderfull game, i really really hate the rng for the artifacts though",5
"It's really fun but i have a little problem. Even though i have a new phone, it still lags a lot and the fps drops just make it harder to enjoy the game.",5
Genshin impact/hoyoverse deleted my account for unowned reason but overall it was kind of boring,3
Best game but demanding 😜😔🤪😋🤩💀👹😱😭😣🙁🤔#mama mo blue,5
I love this app this is the BEST app of the world but i ts very sad when the little girl lost his brother 😭😭😭,5
i really love the game and the story sometimes i get bad wifi but it is very fun i love how the characters are designed and its a great game❤️,5
"This is game is casual game only,no more endgame content (in terms battle) and no buff old characters Just play for 30min/1 hour per day since it is too boring... honkai impact 3rd far more better",4
This one of the best game and really fun,5
Why is it redownloading content when I've played this game a few days ago!?!?!,4
Game jelek mending maen ep ep Kerja bagus!,1
It needs 20 gb resources to be downloaded before starting the game itself. I have installed and immediately uninstalled the game as the storage abd download requirements are too high. Better to give a headsup before we download the game. I don't feel it as a worthy download,1
Nice game,5
I play on mobile and this is one of the best games I've ever played.,5
"One thing for certain that mihoyo is really delivering a high quality game especially for a mobile game, from the world building to the music, voice acting etc... Though being hold back by the annoying traversing system in the big open world, hit or miss story, or even the simplicity of the combat system. If you are a casual gamer, just want to enjoy some cute anime games, this is just for you.",3
خوبی مامانممممم چی میخوره چیپس میخوره,5
Such a famous game and it doesn't accept physical controls. I don't like playing with a touch screen at all.,1
Because it's cutscenes is so amazing 🥰,5
I've been loving the game so far there is just one thing that bugs me when you are on PC you can't see your mouse ingame while not in paimons menu and I'll go to click something and I can't I'll fumble trying to figure out the keybinds. I can't find any option to make your mouse visible I'd love if I could have that option with mobile you simply click the things you need no hustle. Please take this into account in the next update.,4
"Amazing game, especially for being mobile! 100% worth the download. No pay to play stuff either!",5
My game didn't opne,1
"I love it and it was good, this game makes me more excited when i meet venti and the other anemo boys😍",5
I love genshin impact its so fun,5

"I have a earnest request to genshin developers . Pls bring up solvent drop rate. Its been 3 weeks i fought every single weekly bosses with level 90, but i didn't get a single solvent . And now i can't level up my character talents for solvent and i didn't get the needed material either. Pls fix this issue 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",5
One of the great game.,5
"This game is a very fun game to play,example : exploring worlds , unlocking maps , get a new character , and more! I love all the design on the character so maybe this game is recommended.",5
nguli simulator dan tap tap story,5

I love the game and all the charecters,5
"Game ok,tapi nak upload file dia gila babi smpi 3hari",3
Need some buff for xiao,3
It uses up way too much storage. And thier are constant updates that are 1gb each. Used up 24 GB in total. Its one of those games that would be good if they didn't keep adding new features.,1
"What would be cool is that in a future update, genshin impact should make it where other players can battle each other ina certain areana if they are of the same world level and around the same adventure rank, I just thought this up and thought it would be fun instead of just fighting npcs and in game characters the whole time.",5
"Dehya, unlike most people say is an absolute unit. When paired with yae, I realise that the play style is more interesting,. Instead of making characters like ayaka or zhongli I suggest experimenting a bit more to add more variety to play style! And unlike popular belief, this game is f2p friendly. I'm a f2p and only play an hour weekly and yet I'm nearly halfway done with the game after a year! As good as CRK, COS and DA",5
I keep trying to log in with my accounts but I can't it just keeps going to the start and keeps making me use an account,1
Your chinese censorship showing lmao,1
best open world game.. i have suggestion.. if you make mod for player vs player it will more fun.. and add some ranking point in pvp..,5
Pay to win,3
Beautiful graphics,5
gay hahahaha,1
WOW!! IT'S GREAT 😭😭,5
Needs official controller support,3
I love it !!! The animations are so cool. Im looking forward to meet new characters and accomplish new quests🥰🥰🥰,5
The game is very good and best,5
Why can't I see 0 stars button on the Play Store review section 💀?,1
Customer Service ruined it for me. Can't even contact them to unlink my psn account.,2
"This game has heizou and heizou is amazing hes the best and hes just too amazing hes cute and hot and cool and hes just the best play this game for heizou trust me you will love, hug, and kiss him everyday because hes just too amazing mwah heizou",5
best game ever,5
"Everything but the character designing is amazing, the Non playable Characters look gorgeous, meanwhile the playable Characters just look absolute garbage, some look great like zhongli and ayato, jeans new skin looks great but everything else looks like garbage, it looks like a copy paste everytime you bring out a new character",1
Pog,5
Like it,5
😎😎🔥🔥🔥,5
Hutao is Mine,5
Very good 😊😊😊😊😊,5
No controller support,2
Worst game! It lags a lot and it took 4 hours to download and i got the lag,1
No need to say anything best game ever. 😉,5
"It's an overall amazing experience!! But I gave it four stars because, when I first started, it took a long time to load(almost an hour) keep in mind I had full bars 😐... But!! I love this game the quality is amazing and has an amazing story!! But I wish (when we get further into the game) we could summon paimon and she would stay until we de-summon her but that's just personal 🙂",4
Bad game don't care!,1
Game so good,5
"While this game is great as a free to play experience, the amount of times Hoyoverse blatantly ignores its own community is infuriating. Recently their newest 5 star character Dehya released with a PLETHORA of bugs seeming like unfinished work as it works with nothing in the current game, it really seems like they didn't care about making the character playable. I would never recommend this game for THAT alone, and I'm losing interest over this game that blatantly ignores its community.",1
"Changing my review from 1 star to 4, I was originally stuck and was pretty mad at a couple things this game does. But the devs did make it a little better and the game is pretty fun now that some friends are playing. One of the biggest issues is pulling characters you can't use due to not having unlocked the bosses to level them. This can still happen but way less often because only characters from inzuma are locked behind a meanful amount of time",4
This game is one of the best game which I've played in my mobile. It's storyline is so interesting and out of the world concept with amazing graphics on mobile version.,5
"This game is amazing but it takes up 22gb so I play on my laptop, but it's graphics, gameplay, and story are awesome!",5
Emergency food very tasty.,5
"Ok, 2 star bc one I like basically everything abt this game. Two of the reasons i liked it and gave it 2 stars is bc it is a Bearth of The Wild rip-off. It is basically for people who don't have a switch and wanna play a bootleg botw.",2
The fact that they want you to free up 20gb of space is stupid what they should do is actually download the whole game at once instead of downloading it after you think you can already play the game,1
I love it,5
Asiba,5
"Unable to play. Claims to be 355mb download size but requires another 21gb of ""updates"" to allow you to actually open the game. Edit: don't advertise a 355mb game when the first installation is literally 21000mb... it's completely unreasonable.",1
"Excellent game, excellent locations, great view, excellent characters, overall awesome game.",5
Best game tq developer,5
amazinngggg stories,5
"It's a really good game I like the mechanics and everything, buuuuuuut once I downloaded it and logged in and everything, it took from 3:55pm to 7:00pm to get 80% of the game's data download. 😭😭😭😭😭😭",4
Don't do it,5
I never really see like this game before so good so far,5
Kay why ess,1
"Don't bother with desktop or mobile in fact, this game is only good for console the game takes up too much space on them and on console it's easier to play.",4
I love this game,5
Like it keep the good effort,5
i love the graphics,5
"Its like playing an anime cartoon. Edit: 1 ☆ because Mihoyo refuse to implement controller support. Until they stop kissing Apple's @$$, the many of Andoird users won't come back to Genshin. Too bad.",1
I LOVE THE GAME AND CHARACTER'S ARE SO CUTE AND COOL AND HAWT 😍✊,5
I mean it's alright the ads are a bit annoying tho,2
Cool game wish it has pet that can fly to ride on and explore the world from above that will be so cool,5
at first it was cool. later on nothing new all scenarios are repeated. characters need more developments,3
How,3
Great game,4
"I love this game sooo much !! I have spent months on this game and its still fun <3 I got so hooked on this when I first started playing genshin , the characters , music , combat styles and the unique kits for every character and how the total strength of the character depends on the player I just love it so much , the personality of each character is so realistic and honestly betting on , if I will get a character or not in gacha just makes more hooked !! ( yes I'm f2p )",5
I ❤️ taco bell,2
Great,5
"Overall a good game but since I downloaded it again, I have not been able to play it. It keeps saying that there is insufficient storage even though i have 75% space left. Please help troubleshoot this issue.",4
Watched a hour of nothing but a skywalk being built and music all I wanted to do is play the game yet I see that's not going to happen so I'm left with a dission keep watching boring or uninstall I pick ?,1
"Can you please add on charater archive that can sort by date obtained, thank you.",5
Need help,2
It keeps saying i don't have enough storage but I do,4
Takes up way to much GB and plus I'm on a tablet,1
"Genshin Impact I have on my PC as well as my chromebook (cuz why not). I also have it on my phone (because it's that addicting). Lags sometimes, but that is because the chromebook i have is terrible and tiny (not that tiny). Very good game. The graphics may be improved in the future as well. Hope they add it to more devices in the future. I play their other games as well.",5
Very very good game Please added buy houses and sealing monster crops,5
I love this game,5
This game is best have a nice story line and character so cool but for gacha is hard to get a character and some good item,5
20GB still won't work wow very good game :/,1
"Hey uh, the game is all great. I like the mechanic and fighting, all events are awesome but one thing i want to say is why my game lagging for no reason while my device does not overheating? Please fix this quickly and i am very enjoy this game a lot",4
One of the best mobile games out there,5
the beeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssßsst game,5
Why can't we just have a game like this. It is so awesome I can't get off my phone because it's soooo fun to play!😊. I wish they have other games like this in mobile.,5
Why is Dehya so much weaker than other 5 star characters?,1
"I want Mihoyo to change the way they are dealing with the community. Not only just me, everyone wants them to change. Change the reward system, bring good characters and add good content. Just show some caring towards players who put all their valuable time into this game. Please.. all we want is a change from you...",3
Very fun,5
Fix Dehya,1
"I used to play this game religiously for a month so here's my review. The best parts are by far the art, character and world designs. The gameplay isn't anything new and the combat can be a snoozefest sometimes, but for a f2p game it's more than good. +1 for the devs. However, the business folks that run this game are what made me quit. Genshin is super grindy, moreso than any other gacha game I've played and I've tried a lot. The 5star rates are abysmal, and we don't get many chances to pull.",3
I love this game 🎮,5
Best,4
"I love this game, but I have a few problems whenever I leave to text someone for a second. I go back and it doesn't save exactly where I was. For Example: before it could say ""go to ___"", then I've done it. My next task is to ""go get iron"", then I'm there, I'm about to do it, then I get a text. I reply because it's nice to answer someone, I go back to the game and the quest is ""go to ___"" again.",4
"Buff dehya. That new artifact set you're giving her isn't even enough, she needs actual changes in her kit",1
Best game ever,5
I've been arrested by the fbi,3
Not a mod but the community is very nice and wholesome,5
Awsome sauce game. Very awsome sauce.,5
"Gonna make this review posted over and over again despite how many times you delete it. For newcomers, game is good but NOT RECOMMENDED. At first, open world will blow your minds, then as you progress, you will realize how hard it is to farm a single char and if you mess up in the early stages (randomly farming whatever char), it will take you months to catch up (unless you pay ofc). After you clear all story quests everything else is a chore. Events are time gated so you have to plan ahead.",1
"- Bennett is like the number 1 support in the game, but why is it Only the unlucky, teenage boy? Please add more characters that are like as good as Bennett be cause i don't like using Bennett in every team. I think every player has him. He's a 4 star. - We need a feature to toggle constellation of characters such as if you have c6 Bennett you can undo the c6 and put it back on again anytime.And buff Dehya because she has a better lore than the ghost girl.And don't add Barbara to a limited baner",1
"Best rpg my bloodline will ever play Lore is neat af if you pay attention, also play pc version if you mobile can't handle the game well. (If you're judging from the minority of the fandom which fandom itself hates, yes the pdf files then you're an IIIIDDDDIOT)",5
Best game uwu,5
Buff dehya she has many issues and it's very unfair what was done to her.,1
XD,5
Good time killer,5
"3.5 update review: 1. Mihoyo for the love of God, please buff Dehya. She deserves more, better. Seriously omg.... 2. Windblume is interesting if you like Collei & Sucrose, other than that last year Windblume is more joyful 3. With so many HP-focused-build characters, I think there should be new another artifacts other than Tenacity of Melilith, one to buff dmg and elemental skill/burst",3
"keep deleting my review, I'll keep giving you 1 star over and over again <3",1
"Beautiful game, engaging story, even the random world npc quests are charming. The stamina (resin) system needs a serious overhaul or removal before I'd spend a cent on any of it, though. Limiting progress in this fashion in a game with this much potential, and alienating a lot of people who might have spent money on it but won't now, just hurts. Edit: The resin system has been improved and made much more manageable.",5
"I have never experienced anything like this particular game. The game's quality is superb— the lore is very good, the characters are very good, etc. The devs really put their efforts into this game. I LOVED IT.",5
Shame what you guys did to Dehya by making her kit terrible and then putting her on the standard banner. Literally had players saving for months and then dropped a character that's worse than even the majority of 4 stars smh,1
WELL PLAY,5
"Overall the game is nice and the storyline is also good. Even the characters are well made, except Dehya. (Her kit is literally the worst but it's not like we are gonna get characters like Hu Tao or Raiden Shogun everytime) Please optimise the game for low-end devices. (Overheating, lagging, crashing very frequently) The graphics is messed up. (Lags on Lowest Graphics but it's smoothly playable on Medium-High Graphics with some overheat and lag with no constant frame rates) Vivo Z1 Pro (4+64 GB)",4
Hey umm why my rank level stuck at 25 I fully completed the bar exp but it didn't rank up so can you guys help me PLSS because I love this game plss,2
HOYOVERS I can't login my account what did u do,1
"I'm a mobile player and, although at times it can be a bit laggy, overall the graphics and controls are easy to use and sufficient. The game itself is extremely fun and engaging, I've played for over 14 hrs in one week! Played as a story/lore game and a RPG, and not to forget the intricate but well-thought out character kits and how to maximise stats etc. All the best luck to those wishing and gaming!",5
"Yes, it occasionally bugs (I play on my phone), but oh man I can't believe this is actually free. Totally worth occasionally needing to restart it. You know when, in Kingsman, Sam Jackson gives free phones and free internet away to everyone so he can then inact his evil plan? This game being free makes me wonder what the evil plan is.",5

The game of disappointment,1
"Oyun grafikleri, karakter tasarımı ve oyun kombat tekniği açısından (elementel etkileşimler) çok başarılı. Hikayesi derin ve güzel, yeni gelen etkinliklerle oyunda aktif kalmanız daha eğlenceli oluyor, yeni karakterler, kitler gelmesi de çok güzel ancak f2p oynayanlar için verilen ödüllerin biraz az olduğunu düşünüyorum. Istediğiniz bir karakteri çıkarmak için bir süre birikim yapmak zorundasınız. Bunun haricinde co-op da oynanabilen cross platform oldukça keyifli bir oyun, oynamanızı öneririm..",5
So many bug,3

"The company gave too little of the anniversarry rewards. We dont deserve this kind of treatment, the game sure is fun but after spending so much money in this gatcha game yet they gave less of a primogems. Like Wth",1

"One of my favorite games, I'm day one player, despite being very good and the gacha not being invasive, it has a lot of power scaling issue, and new players in 2022 have to play through the entire story quest before they can do the events, which sucks,(edit: already solved in 2023 ) it also suffers storage creep, I used to play on mobile, then it got too big for mobile, so I switched to comp, but the PC version is nowdays 50GB, which isn't worth it, so I'm back on my phone,",5
"Sir there are some poor player spare us😐😑😐.edit: okey first if all I personally love the game, still do its just take too much space and the character summon is way too expensive too can't you make it easy for small space. 17.10GB for mobile😡😡😡 r u kidding me😑 I can't offers that much space that the complaint I have. thank you.",1

Only it's a shame they don't listen to the community and in the recent years they have gotten worse.,1
Probility of getting a five star is so low I wished more than 50 times but still got no 5 star character or weapon.,4
please increase the resin from 160 to 200,2
"It's almost perfect, it's just that if you have no more resins it became a little bit boring, so i would like to recommend to have faster resin regeneration and higher resin storage.",4
I the only thing to say is that this is a really cool game,5
The game is good no words but why do i need 20964.05 mb my connection is bad i need it lower,4

Great open world rpg if you don't mind the grind.,5
Pls fix the dvalin texture bug!!!!!!I cant make progress now because my screen goes crazy and all i can see is different blue colors when fighting dvalin.,5
I never got to play the game because of the 7 billion amount of storage I deleted all of my pictures and it still was not enough!,1

"love absolutely everything about the game, but i do want more map pins + different shapes.. 150 is not enough ;( it'd be better if there was no limit.",5
"Very great game, Graphics are good, Mechanics are good, Storyline feels kinda rushed but that depends on how you play it.",5
The game play is ok but the customer service is so bad that i was going to start spending money but now I won't spent a dime. I followed the exact instructions from customer service but nothing is working and they take forever to get back to you. I feel I am stuck in an infinite loop of going back and forth.,1

"I really wanted to like this game but it may as well be an iOS exclusive. No controller support on PC or Android. 120 frames exclusive to iOS. I liked the story from the short time I played, the game play was fun, but it would be so much better if I could use a controller. LMK if you get controller support for Android and I'll reinstall and give 5*. Until then I'm not paying this game ever again.",1
"Good mechanic system game, I enjoy it a lot. Started with unknowledge about mc, so I choose lumine, but now I regret it, I think aether slightly more suitable with lore (I know that, game dialogue doesn't affect by gender). But please make option to change mc, it's will be perfect!",5

Ngelaq ajing,1
Been playing for more then a year it's really fun i love all the nations you can go to i love all the characters they're very fun to play the graphics are also very good the story is amazing (and quite sad) all the animations are really REALLY good ! and there are alot of bugs in the game but nothing too game breaking 1 thing i have to say though as a f2p they really need to give f2ps atleast enough primogems to reach pity twice or nearly twice but overall i love the game !,5
very good太好了,5
"Please #fixdeyha . Give us an official answer on the situation, why such a bad job was done. Who is responsible, what the consequences will be.",1
Pay to have fun I suggest that you delete the gacha method and replace it with the possibility of purchasing any character and weapon with a specified number of primogems,1
I love it it's the best game,5
"the game is good, the story is good but its very repetitive pls add skip dialogue features, because sometimes when i get excited for playing genshin i also get bored from the dialogues pls add skip dialogs feature and many people also want a skip dialogue features please consider adding that to the game you can use reference from other game (when skipping dialogue there's a summary about the dialogues) thaks alot genshin",3
This game are so good and real feeling of MMORPG and fighting skill and efact are so awesome is good open world game,4

Amazing game I love it! Also it does lag on mobile but besides that on PC and PS4 the quality is amazing,5
I kinda wish there a easier way to delete your account on here without having to use your email,3
"Fix the server,its the only thing in my phone that has huge latency making the game literally unplayable",1
How long is this supposed to take to download? Not worth waiting hours for when all the other games download in a minute or two,1
"Genshin impact has both amazing characters and graphics, the only problems I have with this game is the lack of diversity in their skin tones, and some of the challenges just take way to much time and effort, especially if you don't understand the mechanics or how to build your characters.",3
I love it!,5
What I liked about game is that there is adventure guild and it helps you so much and the best graphics ever,5
money game,1
"PC level game optimised to mobile and it's one of the greatest games I've ever played, sure grinding takes a lot and people say touch grass but I focus on the lore and story more, amazing game",5
"Don't do the Eula story quest, it needs to be quitable. You'll be locked out of multiplayer and certainty pot until you finish",1
Ok,5
the grinds a bit intense but the story makes it consistently interesting,4
Too Hight graphis M,4
People with one star reviews mad they lost their 50/50🤷🏼,5
It was a good game but the fact is that it needs a lot of data which was at first kinda sad because I did not have Wi-Fi.,5
FixDehya u freaks racist,1
Best fr!,5
"Buff Dehya, ult cancels when I jump wth.",1
Nice,5
The game is great but the updates take too much space I'm sorry but I cannot play this anymore,4
"Okay since dev responded I guess I'll expand my thoughts a bit, but before I do, heres a quick warning: The dev comment says to contact customer support, but my ticket was closed immediately (within a second) with an automated response and my email got a non-commital response that was also ai. So, Dehya doesn't do anything she is advertised to do. I cannot in good conscience reccommend a game where a character can be hyped up for so long only to comr out with a clearly bugged and un-tested kit.",1
"Pro: Amazing solo game. Wide world to explore. Tons of activity & quest to chase. Very nice player treatment with events and access to shop & materials. Enemy lv up also, as you lv up, so always a difficult challenge. Heavy grind. Con: Solo game. Anti co-op. The game actually punishes you for playing co-op with friends. While openworld boss are easier to team up against, dungeon enemy gets buffed. Quest are not shared, quest gets locked in multiplayer, absolutely no reason to play with friends.",3
Bro please add skip button. I play 3 acc i already know the story,5
Dehya should be first 3 star character .. what a garbage. Wasted my time and $,1
This game is cool than i immagine and so tragic and adventure i love the story,5
This game is good,5
I love it.,5
Best,5
buff dehya scummy devs no 5 star should be that bad,1
"Game is awesome, but no controllers are compatible for android? It's 2023? Really??",2
The game is working well and fun. I have an advice. Sometime i feel tired or don't have much tome of grinding on the domain for materials or artefacts. I thought that player like me needs some help for that. May be auto battle for solo on domain would help a lot. Hope it could be true. Thank you,4
no eula rerun,1
Fix dehya,1
Very best,5
Very satisfied,5
"It appears they re valuing the players less and less with each decision while being radio silent about it, if the developers would simply communicate plainly it would be better. But they don't do there's really only one thing to do",1
"Quite a fun and pretty game it's scenery is amazing the characters are GORGEOUS. My problem is the artifact system, wishing system. Really hate what they did to my girl dehya she deserves a buff, anyway, the characters are well made (some are meh) the events are sometimes hard but can be quite fun, love some of the characters playstyles and their designs, love how they added the friendship system its quite a nice detail. overall good game REALLY recommend playing but beware of storage!",4
"I have my share of laughter, Thanks for the dead obvious lie back on the 3.5 livestream. Im sure it mislead huge chunk of users, I can't wait to see future characters that's going to have another cover up, if you do please do better when you cover something up. The gameplay looks unconvincing compare to what's being said on script.",1
Mmm yes very good,5
"#FixDehya One of the worst games out there about listen to it's users, period. Game suffers from a lot of issues and Devs seems to not care a little... For Dehya's case I give the app 1 star because 3 reasonable points -False advertisement bout the character as ""powerful"" -Non-existent transparency nor acknowledgement of real user concerning problems -Evidently disregard for user's feedback If Hoyo isn't listening then let this be the spark that ignites a new hell just like the anniversary!!",1
"I have many many hours in this game and it's great, but they just released a character (Dehya) that's just mechanically broken and is pretty much unusable. Hoping that my review along with others will force them to realize they need to fix their mistake.",1
Dehya and candace have been massive disappointments. Overall the end game content is just poor. The abyss is boring. And we need ACTUAL dungeon for the game. The novelty of pulling for characters after 36 starring every abyss is gone. I don't care that it gets harder. It's not more fun. The game needs more resin and more activity surrounding multiplayer that's not limited by resin and has a reward such as artifact potions and weapon ore to keep you busy or something because this is just boring.,1
My phone almost burned because it overheated,1
Very good graphics. Nice knockoff of BOTW with enough different that it's a different game. My major complaint - 21gb of storage and you need wifi to play... seriously? (3.5*),4
great,5
shesh,5
Amazing,5
It's a really fun game but the adventure ranks is hard to do,5
"It awsome, but it needs to lower down the price on character outfits and also wishes for characters",4
This game is 🔥🔥,5
Love this game. The quality and amount of content is amazing. Less impressed with their web events which have soured me on some game aspects but can't be compared to the in game material and the gacha temptation is dangerous. Lol. Lore and character building is addictive as well.,5
please add Rog kunai Gamepad support pls pls pls 🥺,5
"Update: 2 years later and guess what? Still nl Android support for controllers! And if you play with a 3rd party control mapper, you risk getting banned! Done with this game. I have every single character and have kept supporting it in the hopes that either A: Android gets controller support or B: a Switch port comes out. Neither have happened and we're approaching its anniversary in like 2 months or so. You neglected a whole entire platform.",1
حد يعرف ضافو اللغه العربيه ولا لسه؟,5

Been waiting for dehya for 6 month for her to be underwhelming as hell,1
I do not want to see Dehya. How can barbaric woman be this slow and low on damage? I do not want her. Her design bad her playstyle bad. All bad on her...revamp herrrrrr!!!,1
"As a 2 year veteran it pains me to see Hoyoverse just dump out a character as bad as Dehya and call it good. I didn't need her to be meta she just needed to be ""okay"". Its blatant disrespect to any of her fans time and money. Ive just finished uninstalling and don't plan to come back until some kind of Dehya support.",1
good,5
I love the game but there is bugs which needs to be fxed,5
Best game ever,5
This is a fun a bit addicting open world action with great characters and story lots of ways to level up and is overall fun,5

Good game,5
would not recomend/j,1
Very good,5
I love it so much! The graphics and Character designs are INSANE! Keep up the amazing work!<3,5
Cool,5
New characters are bad like some 4-stars from sumeru and inazuma. Even 5-star characters like Dehya is not so satisfying to use. Genshin is getting boring each patches.,1
I love Genshin Impact but it can have serious issues with lag. I've cleared off everything on my phone and it still struggles. It ruins the gameplay since I can't even play the game due to it lagging or crashing when I use a teleport waypoint.,5
The game keeps freezing I can't even get past the intro. Please fix me and my son have been looking forward to this game for a while.,3
Amazing,5
It keeps glitching for me,4
Is the my best favorite game for whole life,5
Lots of bishops and lots of characters you can come,5
Cool graphics cool story,5
This game is so fun although we should be able to fly than glide,5
Nice but I rarely get 5 star characters,4
Hello hoyoverse! I have some complains and suggestions for Dehya because she i quite underwhelming as a new character. 1. Dehya's auto-targetting is binda bad. Especially her burst. Her auto-targetting is so bad that she actually can't hit Azhdaha's tail and many other enemies. -I think making her burst to Normal attacks and giving her burst more duration should fix the problem.,1
удалите игру,1
"The currently released new character, Dehya has a questionable skill set design. Given the stubborness to balance characters, I'm worried for the new upcoming ones and the treatment on their other games in general as they don't listen to their playerbase.",1
Fun combat that feels fluid with detailed characters and environments. Every piece of architecture and every detail on the characters has a purpose reflected in the lore. Edit: went from 5 stars to 3 on 3/13/23 due to Hoyoverse's lack of communication with player concerns (which are increasing and being allowed to fester. This is going to lead to something worse if hoyoverse keeps trying to ignore what is going on with their community),3
Don't know why the game is not connecting to server when on mobile internet but get connected to server on wifi .Please tell,1
This is my fav game of all times best game ever made,5

Am giving it 4 star only because it's compatible in smartphones And I hate what you did to dehya,4
I love razor,5
Super,5
Xiao keeps popping at my fyp in tt and yt and genshin PLS STOP,4
"While a great game, the recent release of Dehya and the numerous bugs found for her, not even including her low numbers for damage and middling damage mitigation, has made me concerned for the state future characters will be released in. I'm not sure if they're banking on purely character design and characterization for sales without building a kit up to par for a 5-star character. But at the end of the day I want to be able to use characters I like effectively, Dehya hurts that confidence.",3

Zmarmowalam zycie grajac w ta gre Nie polecam,1
Everything was ok until tianqu valley,1
Nice,5
Love laugh love genshin,5
Love,5
"I really like this game, but, with the recent release of the 5 star character Dehya and the awful state of her kit, it's clear there is no respect given for the people who play this game, so until such a time as she is buffed to be in line with other 5 star units, I cannot recommend this game to anyone",1
Downloading resources took wayyy too long. I ran out of interest before I even started playing. WHAT THE FRICTION.,1
"It's a really good game with awesome characters but it would be even better if it would not be so laggy. I play Cookie Run Kingdom on the same laptop as well and it runs fine but Genshin is a little laggy. Plus, I can't even download it on my phone because of the amount of storage it has to have and it isn't even compatible on the phone I sometimes play Touhou LW on.",3
I love geshin you get to explore soo many areas I recommend this,5
Fails to take consumer advice,1
I saved for Dehya for more than 3 months and bought a Welkin moon specifically for her. She's extremely disappointing to play. Please buff Dehya.,1
Too hot to play,5
I'm actually really really sad 😭😭 my account loss it's progress i work so hard for it too. Look i love the game i started in like 2021 and stop at 2022 because i was busy with school. I think I played for one year. I just wanna open my account but there's no progress I'm back at the tutorial 😭😭 pls can someone help me get back my account progress or record i got my favorite characters there too 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. Plssss,3
It is amazing I saw it on my friends phone and I wanna download in so bad and I wanna get deyha idk why people be hating on her,5
who?tho,5
This game is good bro but why dehya is so weak? Honestly diluc is alot stronger than her why make dehya so weak? alot of people expect this character to be so strong,3
"I love this game, I have been playing for quite some time and even poured tons of money into it. BUT you took Dehya someone that many of us were excited to play as and made her absolute garbage. It also seems that since sumeru a lot of the 5 stars were lacking in some way. It's starting to feel like constellations are absolutely necessary. I spend lots of money because I like to, not because I have to. Yet lately it feels like we have to for the characters we like. Please do better.",1
Its perfect 😍💎,5
Fix for low ram devices such as 4 or 5 gb,5
Game is very high download pack,1
Good game,5
"Easily one of the best games on mobile. I love the world exploration, music and relaxing nature of the game. The story is good and I enjoy the grind and swapping between a lot of characters. You should not feel pressure to make lots of - if any - in app purchases as you do not need any paid-for content at all. Plays well on my Moto G phone. After following the wonderful Sumeru storyline I was so happy to try out my favourite character Dehya, but she is broken. Please fix Dehya's kit or numbers",2
The graphic is amazing The way you can handle your characters are great It will be better if we have like PVP options,5
Great quality and great animations and paimon is kinda cute (i aint simping),5
"Ruined player expectation of upcoming characters with dehya, not much excitement anymore",1
Love it,5
Just nothing to say but the best open world game I personally have ever played. (:,5
"There's lot's of things to do. Exploration, leveling and quests that take you on a long journey. Being a gacha game it is quite generous with the character banners compared to many other games, but quite stingy with the weapons banner (although it is less horrible than before now). Level up mats and exp is as expected a part time job to gather, but hey it's free. So if you're looking to just explore a whole new world go for it. For those interested the game currently needs 24gb of space.",4
"The game is great. Good stories, gameplay, and controls. I give it 1 star though because of customer service. I purchased a Battle Pass and was charged twice the amount. I already sent them all the receipts and reference numbers but still no compensation. It's been 2 weeks already and they just keep on requiring me to send details for my purchase.",1
Best Game I Have Ever Played,5
Please no one play this game Mann y'all are gonna get morbidly obese from this go touch grass please,1
This game is so entertaining.When you play this game u won't get bored of this game 🤩,5
This game is good but first thing my phone proccer get very hot so i play only 1 hour,4
Very nice game for open world experience,5
This game sucks,1
"Add an Outfit Gacha, pls",4
"It's a very good game. I recommend it for teenagers and up. In the game you can travel trught the world you can do some quests, you can play co-op and there are many events.I hope you will like it.",5
FIX DEHYA. Do not release unfinished characters with unusable kits. I've sent so many emails already. Make sure your products satisfy your clients. A 5* character should not have the functionality of a 3* one. FIX DEHYA. LISTEN TO PLAYER FEEDBACK.,1
SO GOOD PLS MORE UPDATES,5
I love all genshin impact 💗💗💗💗,5
Very good game,4
Best game ever..I like the story and the animation.. this is the best open world game for mobile devices..I first tried it in my phone and honestly I loved it!!,5
.... Pretty good. 👍,5
I love this game,4
It works good on my phone with lowest settings on medium rendering and visual effects. I love this game it's addicting. I've always wanted to roam around in a virtual open world. But after phone system update the game doesn't start so need to reinstall 20gb+ total waste of effort thanks to the system update.,3
"Disgusting practice to release an unusable and useless 5 star. The game is fine, but i would urge you to stay away since the developers cannot be trusted anymore. It is nothing more than a cash grab that fuels their blatant bias.",1
"You know I really like to play this game but first time I download were first time this game came out, it works but after minute it starts to glitching so bad then I deleted it, wen I goes popular I download it again but after log in and downloading data it doesn't work again and I deleted it and download it again and again for 4or5 times but still doesn't work, today I download it again and first I opened this game it wants me to log in and I do it after it doesn't let me download data!!!!!Idk",1
GESHIN IS THE BEST GAME EVER. But there are a few problems in it 1.Requires too much space 2.The storyline is Hella big 3.No free primogems Like there should be a daily login reward. Still a very nice game.,4
Nice game ❤️,5
Dehya😭😭,1
I love this game,5
It a very fun game and many new characters and fun activities,5
Saya rasa macam dalam isekai sangat mantap 👍🤣,5

disappointed with dehya's kits and eula 4.0. I waited for so long and well.... I will not play this game anymore,1
It won't let me log into genshin impact I put my email and password then I do the intelligent verification and it says password or email incorrect but it is correct.,2

"I've started this game about one year ago. I'll rate 5* because I enjoy this game the most. There're many characters,quest, events,etc. For me,the game graphic is already very nice. I'm satisfied with this game. When you need help, you can go to co-Op and ask for help . But when you finish all quest, events,100% all areas,this game will be very boring. All you can do is just doing dailies, waiting for new version,events,etc. But still, this game is fun!",5
"This game is really perfect in every way! I won't get bored if I spend all my time playing it. And if it could have Persian subtitles, it would be great. Please add persian language if you can.",5
"It's an amazing game, my only problem is that logging into accounts becomes too much of a problem for me.",4

"Wish 90 get 1 star ,80 other 💩, this force add character every update nothing special",1
Not gonna lie it was a good game until they released Dehya as a 5 star character. I saw many complaints to her kit and tried it. Let me tell you something. They did her dirty by making her unplayable. Not even enjoyable! Hoyoverse not taking action with all these complaints is really a bad sign for future characters. Not gonna spend anymore for this if they don't take action and make her at least playable.,1
This game is the best,5
"Hello, I really like to play this game, when I installed the data for the first time and entered the game, the game ran, but when I entered the next morning, it gave an error and said that I had to install the old version, but the old version also said I should install the new version, now what should I do? Do I?",1
garbage game with garbage characters.,1
"I would've rated this below four since people with a maximum of 64 GB Storage has having a hard time, I understand about the part that it has to be this way why would it even be played in a mobile if users like us cannot play freely and enjoy... People especially the Otakus are way concerned about this we wish to play this game at our leisure... And why I've rated 4 stars is because the gameplay is nice when I saw my friends play Genshin Impact...",4

Good gam recommended,5

"I absolutely love this game. The beautiful sceneries, the character designs, the amazing soundtracks, everything is spectacular! I just dont really enjoy how little the rewards are, 5-20 primogems? we need 160 primos to gacha once, so it takes a lot of effort for F2Ps. Luckily, the quests and primo gathering sessions are quite fun to do. The animations play a big role for the game. I even set up a schedule for when i will play this game. Since i have other games i have to take care of, hehe.",5
"Cool game but if Hoyoverse can get away with dropping a character as awful as Dehya, it can happen again, and before you say that I'm a meta slave, I don't care about meta, I care about fun and Dehya's not fun to play at all. #savedehya #buffdehya",1

Good game 🎯,5
"While the game has been enjoyable for two years, the latest 5☆ character Dehya shows really worrying signs of implemeting the absolute need for extreme spending to make a 5☆ character remotely usable. These kinds of business decisions should not be supported and thus a review that could've been very good turned sour. Fix Dehya.",1
1 star for not making it as polished as it is on the other OS.,1
"Stuck in the loading screen. I'm on AR56 and it always stuck on the loading screen that is saying my network is having error. However, my WiFi is fast and in full signal bars. C'mon, Hoyoverse, it's getting boring in the game but we still manage to play for the sake of the stories and new adventures. Fix this network error issue.",2

"Artifact rng is terrible, and MiHoYo has not been receptive to criticism from the community about various problems with the game's systems. I've put more time and money into this game than I'd care to admit, and I don't feel that players have been appreciated for their loyalty. Enough is enough, I can't recommend this in good faith to anyone, particularly if you're addiction-prone. The recent release of Dehya has been disappointing from a gameplay standpoint.",1
بازی خیلی خوبی,5
"There's so many adventures omg!!! I've had the game for over a month now, and I seriously recommend it highly. There are still so many things to do in the game. I'm never gonna get bored with this game for sure 😚",5
A great game from frustrating company.,1
"Genshin seemed like such an amazing game so I was really happy whe i downloaded it. But it lets me through the starting bit and it loads with a bunch of small emblems but it gets to the last one and crashes, Every time! it seems like such an amazing game and im so sad i cant even play it.",1

Best game I've ever played & never got bored of....,5
Buff dehya,1
"I put a lot of hours into this game and enjoyed it, but Hoyoverse is taking advantage of its playerbase with Dehya by marketing her as very powerful while releasing her with multiple bugs that made it through beta testing. Almost every ability has at least one issue, if not multiple. Abilities end early if you touch a rock, abilities don't stay on the field after use, autotarget misses enemies and attacks random objects... Imagine paying for an unfinished buggy character. They hope you will.",1
The situation with Dehya is a sobering reminder that nothing happens in a gacha game without it being for the express purpose of profit. I want to believe it can be better. But for the time being it just feels bad knowing the devs don't listen to the playerbase.,1
They need to fix Dehya. Her kit is embarrassing for a 5* character. Does not synergize with most other characters and riddled with bugs. Slap in the face to the players. Like they didn't even test her.,1
"I have a lot of things I can say about this game, but the word limit is 500 Words, so I can't do much. This is all in a nutshell: 1)Its fun (pro) 2)It's addicting (pro) 3) It takes up 22GB of my storage (con) 4) Turns my phone into the sun meaning hot as heck (con) That is all I can say in a nutshell. This game is good, and I give it a 4 star because pros are actually good, like this game. Full impression is 1000 words. This max is 500 words. Arl used up 471 Words.",4
Pretty great game with a lot of interactive events,5
It's good,5
i love it,5

Game is good but sorry I had to do this pls fix dehya,1
"An immersive open world game, but there are a few in game problems with characters Baal/beidou, yoimiya, Kokomo who don't seem fully developed or are simply underwhelming in combat. They are very stingy with any types of rewards but don't take my word for it, go to the Forbes website, they go more in details about mihoyos lack of respect for the player base there.",3
Best game 😌... also stay safe hoyoverse!!,5
Love it,5
dropped from 5* to 2* ..... disappointed with dehya's kit 😒 ...... fix dehya,2
All dark skinned characters are weak in this game.,1
Best experience ever,5
Too much text,1

I been a huge MMORPG player and I truly believe that while in CO-OP mode with friends we can help assist in completing quest , week bosses , and treasure chest loot. I'm sure our fellow players will love the upgrade. :) Thank you for your time. We as players look forward to your new update 😉",3
"the game was fun at first but it progressively became more and more boring, grinding primogems nor doing story quests seem fun anymore. the game takes a lot of storage and is super laggy too, getting primogems are boring, leveling up takes too much time and quests are either too long and informative ( talks too much ) or just really hard to complete in general due to hard puzzles.",3
Nice game,5
10/10 this game looks interesting and i like the battling mechanics then it took time to grind some items it's kinda hard to made it Eula rerun please i like her,5
Released a 5* thats worse than available 4*s...,1
"The only things Genshin has going for it are character designs, music, and events. Endgame is nonexistent, Spiral Abyss is boring and tedious. Also, I hate that they're slowly making new characters money traps when it was f2p friendly before. The new 5 Star character Dehya and her bug-ridden awful kit with pitiful damage and mitigation is by far the worst offender, and Hoyoverse is trying to sweep it under the rug as if nothing happened. Not recommended. Spend your time and money elsewhere.",1
Fix Dehya revamp her kits,1
I personally like the game but I ways have trouble with collectong primogems and wishing properly. Overall 5 out of 5. Really fun and addicting game. I can play for up to 10 hours if allowed.,5
Buff Dehya,1
"Pretty annoying process trying to install this app. Kept saying I didn't have the storage space, but no matter what I did it still came up. I have double, even triple the amount of storage space available and this app still would not install. Lot of wasted time, major bug that needs fixed.",1
THE BEST GAME EVERRRR,5
It's fun,5
Im not fully enjoyed because of my unit my graphics only on lowest set for smooth experience. I hope there will adjustment for lower phone to emjoyed this beautiful open world game and very nice story.. and i would like some request if theres a battle i hope u consider this that theres a background sound for battling experience. Its nice to play if there is. Also i hope theres some combo skills. Thats for now.,5
Fix Dehya,1
Make Dehya better.,1
Wow never knew that a game could be so bad,1
Dehya has good trailer until....,1

its very fun and I love the game play,5
El juego no te recompensa lo suficiente Google deja de borrar mi review,4
There's a theme going on with dark skin tone characters' kits. How long do you think it will last?,1
The best game ever for me! I have played for a year now and I still love it I'm f2p but I've been getting most of the characters I want! I think my luck is going to this game hahahha,5
"Its fun but I have a glitch where I open genshin it'll just stay stuck for the whole time, cutscenes won't load, etc.",2
I really like this game cuz the graphics and the characters so beautiful and handsome.(✯ᴗ✯),5
Idk,5
"account got hacked, no help from hoyoverse, I'm done with this game",1
"The new character, Dehya, has a badly designed kit that is not fit for a 5-star.",1
I saved up and even dropped some cash for the newly released character dehya and shes just not playable outside of gameplay shes amazing but if this is how they'll be treating new characters going forward I'm not gonna support them anymore,1
"I would love to see controller binding for android systems, if I could connect my ps4 controller to my s23+ and play I would give 5 years and recommend",3
"Releasing a character that is barely viable, also costs an absurd amount of money, and not listening to feedback from the community is unacceptable. Hoyoverse needs to upgrade their connection to the community because at the moment there is none.",1
I love this game no issue here keep up the good games I believe in you so keep going,5
Hard to update I hate this 1 because my storage is 30gb my full storage is 64gb BUT WHY I STILL CAN'T UPDATE IT'S JUST SAY INSUFFICIENT STORAGE BLA BLA BLA I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT UNTIL I OPEN YOUTUBE TO GET THE TRIK STILL NOT WORKING!!,3
Awli,5
"Saved 650 wishes for Deyha for what, a broken, unfinished unit, I want my wishes back, And no I'm not a Deyha simp, I have like every character besides Venti and Zhongli, I've spent money on this game, if you are gona release characters this bad then make them 3 stars and give them out for free.",1
Can't play with bluetooth xbox controller on android.,1
Good game,5
Good graphics and story but it was made a little to cutesee for my taste,4
"First and foremost, genshin is a gacha, so just be aware of that. It's a very great game exploration and combat wise, with a much better story than it needed to have. The reason for my poor review is basically due to the insane lack of polish and care in the newest character(dehya) and the lack of response from CS about anything they're actually planning to do about it.",1
Love it,5
"Everytime I have to sit through some lenghty and boring dialogue, I die a little inside. And it just gets worse in the shape of events and side quests. Why this game doesn't have a skip button, is beyond me.",1
Great game but mihoyo is stingy and recently has been releasing characters with bad or even broken kits Edit: This still holds true as of the 3.5 Patch,1
1 star because it didn't even let me play,1
"Things have fallen low again, they released a 5 star character (the best characters in the game) that her kit was very poorly designed, to a point where basic moves cancel her attacks and her signature use is only used 1/3 of the time you use her and she has no real place in any team. This review is telling Hoyo that we aren't pleased with how they released this character's kit and she needs to be fixed",1
Happy birthday Genshin (stop removing my review dear people 💀),5
Fix Dehya. It's unreal how terrible the character is.,1
W GAME,5
Balance Dehya,1
I love the game and the storytelling telling. The only thing is though I do play this majorly on mobile and it's not easy with just touch screen. I know you guys have let iphones use controllers but this option needs to be included for androids as well. Its been a while since this game has been out and this should have already been added. Other than that like I said I love the game,4
I LOVE IT ITS THE BEST GAME 🎮,5
The game is really good and they have a good journey,5
Fun game but recently started going in a worrying direction with the release of a widely anticipated character (Dehya) end up clearly made to encourage/require spending money to function properly. Can't recommend the game if it continues is this direction.,2
"Definitely the most detailed.. and most amazing game I've played in a long time. In 2014 it used to be minecraft and roblox. Now this? Amazing. I swear, if you can get it. Definitely recommend.",5
this game so relsice,5
"Insane how one of the most anticipated characters for 6+ months can be given such a horrifically bad kit and relegated to the standard banner. How dare you shaft Dehya like this. There are many ways to fix her and you only need to do one. She doesn't need to be amazing, just usable. Either increase her multipliers significantly, increase her off field pyro application uptime + frequency, or make her defensive utility worth using instead of shielders or healers. 1 star unless some fix happens.",1
Great game for a phone,5
Open landscape with lots to do but there is only one problem which is downloading which takes very long but other than that great game,5
Its fun until they release dehya and candace. Dehya and candace doesnt deserve this. Fix dehya and candace. Buff them,1
Best game ever,5
Nice,5
Make 👏 Catgirls 👏 Strong 👏 Now,1
"It, takes forever.",1
Best game,5
Took too much time to link Hoyo acc and couldn't even play it due to no storage. Waste of time,1
"Terrible It didnt work at all for my laptop it is 100 free of space and genshin didnt work just kicked me out,0\10 dissapointing",1
todo esta bien pero tu si el personaje que entra se esta cargando mucho y mucho jejeje,4
I really love this game the graphics are amazing the characters are amazing I just love to play when I have free time is a very good game for you to play,5
IT SUCKS I SPENT 14 DOLLARS AND GOT THE SAME THINGS,5
"Great art, gameplay, and story, but lacking in communication. The dev team is very stubborn and will not listen to feedback and adjust characters accordingly, even though the Honkai devs do. Dehya is buggy and extremely weak. Some character bugs, like Xinyan's, still have not been fixed even after several years. Lots of quality of life changes like toggleable constellations and visible shield hp are also still missing. Hopefully, a good competitor that actually listens to players will appear.",2
So good,5
This game is pretty good the storyline is good too but it's not a game I will play to much,3
fix dehya,1
"I can't even play. My problem is that when I tried downloading it said insufficient storage space even though I cleared almost everything out before downloading. Such as images, screenshots, screen recordings, apps, history, download history and cookies. And yet, it said infufficient storage. Is it because to download this game it take up 300+MB? Because if not, What is?",1
"I can't play it after the new update. I tried uninstalling, reinstalling, and after that everything seems to be fine. But you can log in, and start downloading all the resources it'll finish after like 2 hours because its like 20,000 MB, then it'll try to verify and itll crash around 30-50%. I have a pretty high end chromebook too and it still crashes. I would have given this 5 stars though, If you have a pc, definitely play its fun. But for now I have to let it collect dust until I get a pc.",1
"Why in the world would you release such a good looking 5 star character only to make her kit and overall damage output be below average?? A multi million dollar company can't seem to comprehend what a 5 star character is. Buff Dehya and her overall kit because this is just degrading to the character, the people that worked on the design of the character, and the people who have her in their party. This is not a good look for you Loyoverse. FIX IT.",1
"Wow ... This game is keeping me busy, hour after hour. Well created and really worth downloading.. yeah it's big but trust me it's worth it.... Normally I don't leave comments but this one deserves it... Also noted it's not money hungry and has a super cool story mode. Open world peeps this is a must have !!!",5
Please fix Dehya. #FixDehya,1
I love the game it's just that getting diona is so hard,5
"Unable to install, requires 20+gb of space and will not install on sd card. Giving 3 stars to be neutral.",3
"#FixDehya Your customer service team can't be bothered to listen to the massive lack of balancing and conflictions of Dehya's kit; so instead this might be one of the only ways to get any attention. Dehya, the newest five star, is a gigantic money-grab who is absolutely imbalanced and needs every constellation (several hundreds of dollars) to be DECENT. Her kit was rushed and released unfinished, it's also an incredibly buggy mess. There should be higher quality standards for characters.",1
Hoyoverse does not respond regarding character issues. Dehya is released as a buggy and essentially unusable character and due to her state they jus tput her in standard banner. Do not get hopes up for any character to be released in the future. I may revise my review again when I don't feel duped. Also lately story pacing has been.... not as good? Dialogue goes on and on and on and is repetitive for tiny smidges of information. Please address Dehya!!,1
Have lost gaith in Hoyo after the last 5star character they released was super buggy and weak. Dont get this game,1
fix dehya,1
this game is damn good,5
"The game is okay, but the developer makes a lot of strange decisions and fails to fix glaring issues over time or improve quality of life in playing the game. Simple things like a ""Repeat Previous Expeditions"" button that players have been wanting for ages or more serious things like the trashed kits of certain characters (Amber, Dori, Candace, Xinyan, and now Dehya) that they just never fix. Fix Dehya.",1
Fix dehya,1
"This is a pretty good game, but it is frustrating that iOS has controller support while Android does not. This is a deal breaker for me.",3
Excellent,5
It's so nice,5
This game gave me cancer!,1
I like it but I need help how do I log into my account which I have on my computer can I log Into the account from my tablet?,5

"(READ IT) terrible app 😡👎 I downloaded this game to have fun but it's terrible and it takes for ever to work don't download I definitely don't recommend it if you have it un install it, it gives a virus on your phone that spreads across your device be careful it's a scam!!!!!",1
Nice but somehow lagging in my new 8gb ram mobile,4
It is an amazing game to play,5
"The developer is ok releasing sub par characters that have no kit cohesion, this could be a great game if they cared about all the characters equally but they don't. Hoyo has been told for weeks that Dehya's kit does not work and is at odds with itself. But they did nothing and I can't support a developer whose design philosphoes include releasing bad characters that people will pay money for, if they did it now they can do it again and probably will and it's a scummy practice.",1
Love it!,5
THIS IS THE BEST OPEN WORLD ADVENTURE GAME ON PHONE. THE MUSIC IS IMMERSIVE AND SO COOL,5
#Fix Dehya,1
"Playing since day 1 and enjoyed every minute of it, but patch 3.5 is very disappointing. Looked forward to Dehya's release since Sumeru came out. And now that Dehya is out, her kit is very buggy and underwhelming in power level. She hits like a wet noodle and a 4* provides more support than she can. Dehya's more like a 3* character which is very sad for a character I was hyped to pull for.",1
Game of the centuries! I can not wait for a second,4
I've been trying to do the in game updates but it keeps saying insufficient storage mean while I spent $20 on a SD card and did a FACTORY RESET and still does not work so ya don't recommend it,1
"Actually great game, but 3.5 make me dead incide.... Fix Dehya! Make this game great again!",1
"Devs out of tuch with the player base, typical situation. #FixDehya",1
"Only a little bit in, honestly pretty fun, the movement joystick is a little wonky but other than that it's good.",4
"I love the game it's fun, easy to follow and captivating I would recommend this for people looking for a good adventure game.",5
these guys make weird decisions. Female characters are weak if they're adults. Only archons are alright.,1
Is a beautiful game and realist but this game is 20G storage,4
good,5
"Seriously when I look up something serious all I get is this stupid game, geez this is the first time I'm actually not going to stfu about something like this, but change albedo's name I'm trying to find someone who is born with that. Oh and Albedo means having white hair everywhere sense birth. Now if you EXCUSE me, I'm going to do something with my life.",1
Haha,5
"The Dehya release is very poor, not sure how Hoyoverse can release a 5 star this poorly designed kit wise. Especially a character that is as liked by the community.",1
"With making more space on my phone, I'm still unable to play the game since the recent update. Unfortunately looks like I have to depart with this game. I have enjoyed this game during the pandemic and I hope to come around this beatiful game again if I ever own a console or pc.",1
"if i could give 0 stars i would, game got worse after sumeru and is apparently racist and discriminatory against POC, especially against Dehya and Xinyan",1
"Pls do something about Dehya. Her kit is Really bad, at least give her better Multipliers!",1
"time to review, since I've been playing from 2020 i had loads of ups and downs playing this game, but mostly its all been good, good graphics, combat, music, events, characters, story. Other than being mad losing to a 50/50 this game has been my friend since the pandemic. All i gotta say is, i hope genshin doesnt die soon cuz i love this game",5
This game is great.,5

Great,5
GREEDY COMPANY,3

"Fix Dehya !! Good music. Good combat. Good environment. But BAD power balance each character. Bad ranged weapon system such as bow and catalyst. Auto aim is in trouble. And Dev never care about it. I played this game since it have launched. But right now, They do still not fix it. I feel like I waste money. Everything in game is Gacha including artifacts. I hope one day Dev will make random droping better. Story in game is good for 1.0-2.0 patch. Story 2.1patch is so rush and unreasonable.",1
"Why does it take up so much storage? I used to love this game, but I can't even play anymore because of the amount of storage it takes.",2
Lost my old account and can't seem to even get it back tried logging in with the same accs but nothing it's telling me to make a new character,1
they ruined Dehya.,1
Best,5
Game ini grafik bagus dan jalan cerita pun best,5
Fix dehya and bring back Eula,1
Quality of character being released is at an all time low. They don't QA or listen to beta testing feedback before releasing unfinished products. They need to provide a recall option for dehya with the amount of bugs that were found for that character already.,1
this is a great game but it was so hard to lvl up cause if you're not in a lvl that should be reach you'll not be able to continue the story,2
ty for dehya,1
Boring... Not fun as it used to be. Add a skip button during cutscenes and dialogues between characters and I might reconsider.,1
"Great game but I'm slowly losing hope because of the fandom where I kind of think Hoyoverse is being forced to give fanservice where the plot is beginning to become irrelevant now so please just stop feeding the fandom and let your ideas stay on the game, don't remove important or useful plot like Guizhong and Zhongli's past cause it won't hurt a lot of people and please just stick with the usual Traveller trying to find clues rather than supporting horny teens to make their headcanons true...",3
AWFUL GRAGHICS IT DOG POOP..TRASHHHH THIS GAME HAS NtO TASTE LOLIKIKIKIKIPLOLLOLOLOLL THere SO RUDEEE HEHHHAHAHAHHEEHAHHEH. WHA LOSERSSSSTAKES FOREVER TO UPDATE THIS DAMN GAME UGH SO RUDE.,1
pretty good,5
Kece bat grafikny emng,5
Awful customer service. You can't skip lengthy and meaningless dialogs. Achievements locked by RNG. Gameplay is ok. Upd. They advise to contact customer service (which is awful) to address the issues with customer service.,1
Yes massive open world that can almost kill your phone but since I'm using a galaxy s22 ultra I have the best graphics on and it's heaven,5
Good,5
I've always loved the story and characters in this game since I began playing in 1.3. Mihoyo was always able to find a way to make me fall in love with a character and design again and again over these past 2 years. But as more and more time has passed? I've truly realized just how little they truly care about their playerbase. It seems that the greed got to them just as quickly as it did others. Dehya is the embodiment of their disregarding.. I hope they finally fix something sooner or later.,1
Can't update it,4
Great game.,5
"Why does it need so much storage ?? I can't even play it bcs its keep on telling me to clear storage before playing. Well, it's a good game even tho i havent play it yet.",1
"Simping for alhaitham, zhongli and ayato now",5
No words you can enjoy it And a went to a virtual world,5
would be nice if there's controller support like ios but i guess this company has a bias,2
Why just ruin a character for no good reason? At least make dehya usable and stop dodging the communitys complains about her.,1
"Apex experience, loving the open world and all the various quest along with it. Thanks for the game and keep up the good work 🥰😍🥰",5
"There's a little bit of everything for everyone, but it's not a difficult or challenging game in general so if you are looking for that sort of thing you probably want to look elsewhere.",5
You'll have amazing experience playing this game. Though it's a bit heavy to download but it's worth the wait. I lowered it to 3 stars because after updating the application it started redownloading all the 5gb+ resources (Edited),4
To much loading,4
I kind of like this game I can't login,1
Good,5
Balanced 💮 ❤️‍🔥,4
gayshin impact,5
Really good enjoying it rn.,5
"gameplay 5/5, story 4/5 , character design 4/5, world map 5/5, f2p friendly 4/5, artifacts grinding system -100/5",1
"Takes up 22.6G on my phone before even really playing it, it can't be THAT good. (I have PLENTY of space, but this game requires about 14G more storage than ANY other game I have ever installed, does THE WHOLE WORLD need to be on my phone before I can play?) INCREMENTAL LOADING, yeah it IS slower, but an option?",2
"Thank you so much for such a fun game, I hope to see the ending soon but add a 5th party sloth there are just to much character and a limited qiqi keqing and Mona banner",5
"the rewards in mail should last longer than only one day. i cannot count how many times i lost precious rewards and gifts, even the birthday one, because i wasnt able to log in on specific days",1
Wow,5
It's a good game with best of best graphics sound effects but the when the story mode is completed .... There is nothing to do except some daily commission and bosses 🤌 Please update the game by increasing map size and new stories,3
What a cool game,5
"The world is so massive including the story it's offer....never want to let go this masterpiece for sure so,when we got 5 star weapon as craftable material?ehe....",5
you need like 50 GB for this game,1
I like this pls fix I can't see grass and water freezing,4
Lags a lot need a lot of time to load even if my wifi is good. Fix it all. Also when we say fix Dehya it's not her eyes you should fix it's her kit. FIX HER PLS SHE HAS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STORY SO FIX HER,1
What i really hate on this game is finding materials on ascending heroes. It gives you the clue where to find but what? Do i need to climb it out or go to the dungeon etc.? At least give like a indicator on the map to find that material.,1
Love this game,5
How to link my account to ps5,5
It's very fun.,5
"Amazing! My favourite game tch. Visuals are stunning, characters are so cool and the storyline is super fun and mysterious",5
Please add controller support for Android devices please,1
Ii love it I been playing this for 2 years!!,5
The best game I've ever played,5
"How am i supposed to love a game when the devs don't love thier own characters? Half the excitement for the game comes from getting new characters, seeing what happened to dehya and hoyo's uncaring attitude, what am i supposed to get excited for in the future updates? This can happen to any character i get fixated on!! Plus, dehya's stink treatment has already left a sour experience.",1
I hope your company goes bankrupt especially after what you did to Dehya #FixDehya #BuffDehya,1
My account got hacked please let me take it back!,1
This is such an amazing game there is so much to explore and the designs literally so beautiful,5
Please make the time longer on the ritou escape plan its been 1 week stuck on the quest thank you,1
Zamn,5
Superb I like the game,5
"Tbh I loved this game. Until there was an update, this game keeps saying no more storage no matter how much I delete hoyo please fix this.",2
dope...,5
Enta ponno kinnam game ❤️‍🔥,5
"Dehya's release with such badly balanced abilites which are bad in all support, defence, dps, sub dps categories is a good sign that the devs do not care about players at all. And they will make any character they do not like have bad abilities and throw them into standard banner. And theres high possibility they will pull the same thing with other characters and use the standard banner as the garbage bin so if the players lose 50/50 to these characters they feel as bad as they possibley could.",1
I like this game,5
"I've been playing this sh1tty game since 1.0, it is purely trash af and rigged made by pig fatty company, i hope you all die the worst ways possible",1
"I used to like and enjoy this game a lot before but now it makes you annoyed, it's just that as your AR rises the enemies and challenges are getting stronger and harder(of course that's a given), but I think the game is a bit imbalance with regards to the enemies getting stronger but your character doesn't get a decent weapon and artifacts, an items to make your character level up without opening the other side of the map yet.",5
"Hello dev! Thank you for making this game and i really like all characters in this game, but when I'm trying to enter this game it's loading like for 1 month to wait. I'm using mobile actually. I really want to play this game. I have uninstall and download this game for like 7 times and still nothing happen. I don't really enjoy this game. Please, fix this. Thank you.",1
I love this game soo good,5
AMAZING GAME 😍🤩,5
Nice game but too much big so i cannot play it now D:,5
Good,5
"I played on PC. I HAVE SPENT OVER $8,000 ON GACHA GAME. NOW I WILL SPEND ANOTHER $12,000 BECAUSE I CAN PLAY THIS GAME ANYWHERE INSTEAD OF BEING STUCK TO MY COMPUTER! THIS IS WHAT ALL GAMES SHOULD BE, WHERE YOU THROW MONEY TO DEVS FOR MAKING THIS GAMBLING ADDICTIVE GAME ESPECIALLY FOR UNDERAGE KIDS. MY KID , 15YO, SPENT 6000 DOLLARS OF COLLEGE FUND FOR THIS AMAZING GAME. IT IS THAT FUN! I AM BROKE FOR SPENDING MY LIFE SAVINGS BUT I AM HAVING FUN! How much is fun worth to you?",5
I really love this game but it takes too much storage due to of that my freind's wanted to play it but they can't play due to of its storage can you do anything to fix the storage problem...... please!.....,4

I love it 💖,5
Fix Dehya pls,1
Too big,2
Super,5
I've been playing this game for 10 months and I am addicted to it! That's why it saddens me that the devs are ignoring us and giving us tiny rewards for any huge milestones. They should listen more to their fanbase to keep this game going for years and years to come!,5
"Todo bien pero necesito que arreglen el bug al apuntar con el arco, que se queda congelado. Solo pasa en móvil",5
"it's great game but i haven't played it yet it took days to finish the download resources'anyway i like to make a request,will you make an update for us to you know like the mobile legend that it download resources but it has entered on game pls",2

This game has got to be the best,5
Best rpg game ever!!!,5
It's good,5
One of the best games I've played out there. I can't play it on my phone because even at the lowest graphics setting it lags and crashes so I'll stick to playing it on my PC. Can't expect a small phone like mine to pump such a large game anyway lol. I really have no complaints for the game. Definitely download it and give it a go for sure! ( Download size is 20+ gb ),5
please just get rid of the furnishing limit in the serenitea pot-,4
Super fun ngl!,5
For a game so big and so popular to not support external gamepads on Android is insane. Uninstalled immediately.,1
"Wont change my rating . Waiting to see how many donkey years will it take for mihiyo to implement the god damn SKIP button. Earning so much via gacha but yet they dont even bother to put in skip. Still enforcing players to waste time looking at the story(even though is the minority that dont give a damn about the story). Going globalized yeah ""as if""",1
I luv it tho,5
This is a nice app!,5
This is a really great game and the different nations are really unique as well!,5
I like Wednesday,5
"Hmm. I don't have wifi or unlimited internet,i have downloaded this game and now I have to waiting whole month to download it. I know this issue can't be fixed by developers, but i still want your smart developers come up with something",3
poppppppppppppppppy,1
"What a good game , IM really enjoy it",5
Idk I deleted it because I have no space💵,5
"The BEST GAME IN THE WORLD BADGE BELONGS TO genshin impact IT HAS THE BEST GRAPHICS,SO MANY GOOD STORIES,SO MANY HOT CHARACTERS,ETC THIS IS THE BEST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED BE4",5
"16x10 in a row only jean 5star,this game sucks",1
Good,5
"shut up with your dogshit about excessive anxiety hoyo, you ruin dehya is enough to ruin my mood everyday",1
Great game,5
Can't change character while fighting,1
I LUV GEBSHIM,5
"It's a good game overall but can you respawn the chest in ""this treasure goes to.."" because I know atleast some people have accidentally opened that before. Other than that it's good",4
Game had been great other then a few issues common to these types of games. But since the last update the game constantly has server connection issues. Leaving it almost unplayable.,1
"Its a fun game, the graphics and lore are great. And its introvert friendly that i have played for a year already. For a picky gamer that only sticks to games for a few weeks I'm surprised I'm is still playing. I never had much problems with the game since its chill, except of course the artifact farming, and pity system which is normal already. But today the game keeps on crashing on my phone when i play TCG, hoping for it to be fixed if possible. Thank you for your hard work.",4
Excellent 💜,5
"Game nya bagus, grafik nya keren, story nya juga seru >< AWAS KALAU MISALNYA GANYU GAK PULANG! Auto nangis di pojokan😭 EDIT: YEHEEYY!! GANYU PULAAANGG",5
"I love the game.. And i feel bad for mihoyo getting bad rates (Edit: i change my mind, the game destroys your storage but its still amazing.)",3
The last character Dehya have really bad performance in game,1
Poosay,5
Good game but two much gb,3
"Best app ever, after playing for a week I was absolutely obsessed with this app and I highly recommend it.",5
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!! IM ADDICTED!! ^u^,5
"my phone today keep cannot open for the game, is it having any bug?",3
OMG OMG BACK TO BACK FIVE STARS?! THANK U HOYOVERSE,5
I love the big open-world style game. Didn't think mobile would be so advanced!,5
If only they could invent a way to play this beautiful game like Sword art online did🥺🥺,5
"It's not working that customer service didn't unlink my PSN Account, please fix it to let us unlink PSN account",2
"It's a great game. My only complaint is; when you are fighting, the camera angle constantly changes and makes it impossible to see properly in many instances. Everybody puts the camera angle exactly where they want it, so this feature is not only unnecessary, but very annoying. Please fix.",4
It's good,5
🙂,5
"Game is great, however I can only tolerate playing it if I'm on PC. If I'm home and on my PC there are other things I'd rather be doing. Android lacks controller support (iPhone has it already) and there's no Steam Deck support, so I have no reasonable option to play it mobile as I can't stand the on-screen controls.",1
Give an option to rerun the story from start.,1
👍,5
I love genshin so much,5
"After playing genshin impact ever since launch. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is phenomenal. And if it where to be viewed as a waifu/husbando collector, it doesn't disappoint with its high number of character designs that all look unique. But my biggest gripe with the game is it's equipment system because the equipment system is far too RNG based, thus it can result in the player spending a ludicrous amount of time slaving away to build one character to be strong.",4
Its not letting me sign in it keeps kicking me put of it I keep deleting my games over and over and over again,1
THE BEST GAME EVERRR,5
"This game is the best of the best, but I hope the artifact farming system can be changed. 😭",5
No more genshin impact,1
"Waifu simulator #384 Has all your standard ""free game"" fare; cosmetics, gacha, in-game currency, season pass, 2nd subscription, elevensies subscription and so on. Gacha is stingy and duplicates are common. Puts all its effort into LOOKING good, But that is only worth partial credit. Quests are all buggy. Dialog is mismatched even along the main quest line. MC has a voice actor but is mute and the side character does most of the talking? Weapons classes all play the same.",3
It's amazing love it,5
Yesssaz,5
Genshin impact is a great game,5
I love the graphics and the quests,5
Coming from full time honkai player.. Its not bad at all..,4
"This game is better than I thought. I thought I wouldn't like it because of the memes and stuff like that, but trying it got me into it. It's so addicting and I can't wait to get my friends into this game and reach Adventure Rank 16 to play it with them (Mine currently is 7).",5
One of rhe best games ever!!,5
Nice,5
Literally the best >♡<!!,5
WELL DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS DUMB GAME IT TAKE 8 DAYS JUST TO LOAD,1
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME!! BUT Hoyo PLEASE fix this bug that is going on where the game won't let you download it fully because it says there insufficient storage, I am currently trying to download it on a 256 gig tablet that has less than half the space used and it's saying that there is insufficient space even though I have more than enough space on the tablet. PLEASE fix this I really want to get back to playing this game I had to delete it off my phone because I had the same problem.",3
I really like the graphics and details into each scene not to mention how put together the story is so far I really like it.,5
Amazing grqphics..amazing story line...all i can say i fell in love with it eve4y time i playing it...,5
It's sooo 🅒🅞🅞🅛 I'm in love with the game🎮!!! ❤🤭,5
"Amazing game, takes up to much storage tho",4
"Hoyoverse, I love this game!! I swear I love all the characters and stories but the storage... Please do something about this hoyoverse! You advertise this game for mobile phones but the storage says otherwise.. please control the storage issues",3
Awesome and very rewording,5
I love playing the game amazing art work and every detail it's a grate game to play with friends fight bosses ascend you characters do world qwest always new character comeing new to the game,5
"It now takes me through the loading screen, but the second I'm supposed to enter the actual game it closes without warning. I overall love this game, highly recommend it but I've been out of the game in quite a while... I've permanently swapped devices so now it'll no longer install on my mobile, my PC is what I'm using now, and when I try to install it here it doesnt get far past the loading screen... I highly recommend and still love the game! It's fun and the community is cool!Please help...",4
G.I has everything I want in a game only problem is storage but the pros outweigh the cons. 👁👁,5
It's ❤️,5
"The game overal is good in the beginning but gets rather repetitive after a while as there's no end game. The reason for the low review is because of the horrible player to company relationship, basically if there's something wrong and people point it out the company deals with it by ignoring it completely and waiting for people to give up. This is a very toxic and honestly disgusting way to interact with your playerbase who just like the company only wishes for the game to be better.",1
"(Updated with Dehya released) Slowly become boring and repetitive. Nonsense events are there to fill the "" lack of content"" hole. Limit your team comp with bad character kit design. Abyss system is so boring, its not hard. Doable but its time-consuming rather than fun. In a time limit mode, either the mobs just running/flying around try to buy time or just becoming invincible for no reason. Stories are good enough but not all of them ofc. Artists and character designers really carry everything.",1
"Hi, the game is all fun to play and amazing, and i like co op with others, but communicating is a little bit difficult since we have different languages. And since arabic starts from right to left, all the messages written in arabic are inverted, hopefully you solve this problem, and add a ""translate"" option of the message . Even more, it will be better if we were able to copy message from the chat. Mostly i recommend considering that arabic start from right to left when typing, and thanks.",4
Gud game. Me like game,5
Totally suggestive for those who want to play ut specially to my friendsss their happy to play this etc,5
"Enjoyed playing it from my Ps4 to my Infinix Note 12 G96! And oh, here's my graphics setting that i recommend for all Infinix Note 12 users out there: Graphics set to high, other settings medium, motion blur off, fps 60, and that is it.",5
"Imagine, you just collected all the primos that u want for a specific event banner character , and also u have high amount of pity already , suddenly all of that just for a character that are in the standard banner...bro..like can u just like...do u know how most of the player's heart shattered just like that becuz of that, all of the hardwork just go in a drain just like that.. pls make a change about that.. I AM ON A C2 DICLUC AND C1 QIQI ALREADY CAN U LIKE IMPROVE YOUR WISH SYSTEM",1
"I absolutely love the game , it has been so much experience and investment of emotions . I will come back to Genshin , until then well wishes to both of us . Left date : 2/10/21 , V2.1 + 2 weeks :) I'll be back >_< Edit: Just came by 🙂 , still not ready to come back . All well here ... Hope Genshin is doing well also . See you soon 🤗 12/3/23",5
I have a problem i don't know how but my game keeps on crashing after every 15-20 minutes. And i also play on the lowest graphics possible and my device is only a gets a littlebit of warm please provide me a solution.,4
I like the game but it fir those who do not have enough work and have plenty of time.,5
Best open world game on mobile!!!,5
its very good,5
fix dehya,1
"The game has the best graphic in mobile so far, that's why quite many devices are tortured for running the game. The combat is simple. Some puzzles are interesting. But after you reach high Adventure Rank, the burnout is inevitable (IMO). Now, I feel like getting scammed with underwhelming characters that they release. Besides that, they don't listen to players feedback.",2
"MIHOYO MAKE MORE COOL SCENES LONGER AND COOLER I LOVE YOU GENSHIN PLEASE, RELEASED KAVEH OUT QUICKLY I'LL BE A JUMPING DONKEY IF U MAKE MORE CHARACTERS MAKE A REALLY BUFF MEN JUST LIKE AL HAITHAM AND MAKE A MAN LIKE KAVEH",5
"Not playable due to the 9907 error even with an exorbitant amount of cleared storage space. I've cleared the cache & data, reinstalled & even factory reset my phone. Unbelievable that a 1.4 billion dollar gaming company can't make a viable mobile port of their biggest cash cow.",1
I GOT HACKED WHAT IS THIS SUCURITY,1
always lose at 50/50,2
fake ads .never got my free 20 pulls for new player.scam,1
Wow,5
Need more event,4
I m very disappoint because this game can't support controller in Android please fix this issue in next update,1
"Stats from 5 star characters are worse than 4 star characters, playstyle on some of these characters are absolutely horrible. I was disappointed when I found out that yae Miko was a summon character. The quests are long and the game also takes up so much storage my old phone broke from this game. The game is glitchy and graphics on mobile are way worse than graphics on other devices. You can only do most things if you are AR 45 or above and that annoys me and some players. Do not recommend.",1
Too much storage data to download,2
i like,5
Likeeeeed,5
"Its good! But there are a few problems and bugs ive encounter, like whenever i am fighting a boss and sucessfully did defeat it, it would kick me out of the game. And if i open it again it basically restart all the way back. thatts all i have expirence, this rate can be 5 stars but if glitch or bugs like this, might as well 4",5
"Great game overall, I have some suggestion There should be a event where you can let traveler change weapons a yearly event But you can choose one of the 4 weapons and keep that playstyle (for ex. Catalyst) with the sword playstyle and wait for the next event. And an item that lets you fly around like a flying board (lol) And increase max resin and comissions and rewards I really like playing and following the lore of this game , it's a great game overall",5
I love it so much 😍,5
"I like genshin , its a good game but personally i hate when some devices have to download over 15gb+ while others do not , + don't even get me started on the cutscenes , i wish there was an option to skip them or dialogues , i have to spend a whole 10 minutes watching some thing boring instead of doing the actual task. Also Dehya needs an upgrade , her kit is so trash though her character is great i personally hate her kit please give her a boost omg.. please hoyo fix your game!",2
❤️,5
20+ GB storage required,4
"try not to be racist hoyoverse, or is it that hard for you",1
Cool,5
love it <3,5
Dehya deserve 4star only,3
It is very good game,5
Like it,5
Wery good,5
This game is best. I really like this game and very satisfied with it. Graphics are great and characters are best too. However daily commission rewards are too low especially primos. I want more rewards from daily commissions.,5
A great game👍👍,5
Rác vì không có nút skip cái story rác rưởi,1
Theres barely any darker skinned characters. Horrible representation,1
This game is awesome,5
Help... It was my birthday 4 days ago and I didn't receive any cake from genshin huhuhuhuhu now I'm sad TT^TT,4
Nice game,5
Please buf Dehya pls pls pls,5
"Not bad, I like this game. Characters are very good.",4
"If hoyo doesn't rework Dehya, it means they're not respecful twords us (the fanbase/customer) and this rating remains at 1star",1
Love this game,5
Great. And super fun.,5
"It is an amazing game if it wasn't for the long dialog,it would be much better if it had a skip button",4
Best game of the Android,5
I'm like this game and the character but please make the size of the game very very low size please fix the size game I'm download this take 20GB size take time to download that data for the game,2
"I like exploring but it feels like I'm doing something wrong. Most enemies become so tedious and annoying to kill as you get closer to lvl 20. Leveling is IMMENSELY slow and doesn't scale to the story, meaning that, you'll be stuck 10+ levels behind the next story mission - even after having completed all sidequests and extra objectives. Despite that, exploring the world has been a rewarding experience that few games provide today.",3
"Dear hoyovers, i save 62 wish but you don't rerun eula in 3.5 can you pls rerun eula in 3.6?? I realy want her. Thank you.",5
"Please fix dehya, she's also one of the most awaited characters and this..is just dissapointing",1
Genshin Impact is an escape,5
yeah i got sucked in,5
save yourself. don't do it.,1
Only reason I'm playing is because people say it's like botw edit: also bc I got a offer on battle cats,3
good but i really want that xiao :<,4
It's so cool just play it 😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤👁👄👁,5
I'm gonna try again and update you!,3
Good,5
Best ever game i played on a android,5
"The game is very good and fun, but the volume is large",4
This game Is cool but I found a bug in the quest wangshu I found the sigil but when I try to interact with it. It doesn't work so I can't play co-op now and please fix this,4
"The best game i have played in me entire life and i love the art, the characters the mechanics the mountains the view and the lore amazing and everything is beautiful",5
Still no Redhorn Stonethresher this time. My Itto must be completed!!!,5
nice app hha,5
I don't have space,1
"Amazing!! This game has amazing graphics,story line, carecters. I definitely recommend this game.",5
I'd give this game a 5 star rating as mobile and pc cross play game this game is insane. It is so optimized.,5
🐺,5
الحب,5
A very nice game,4
"HLEP I CANT LOG IN MY ACCOUNT PLS, this games good tho 🥰",5
"They know exactly what their community wants and why everyone is here. With this knowledge they monetize the heck out of the reason why people play.. Wifus and husbandos! And they monetize them to the very stars! Gameplay is great nonetheless as they definitely use their MASSIVE revenue to make it just as engaging as the attractive characters. The story is slow but that's not why people play the game. It's fun, beautiful, and is everything the internet could want. Enjoy",4
I put it at 5 because the characters are hot 🔥,5
This is not like giving it to zero Stars I think straight hair cuz he said I did have a storage when I just deleted every single little thing oh so broke my phone I'm not doing something right,1
I like the storyline and it's just amazing,5
"Decent Game but Hoyoverse Ignores every and anything from their players. If your looking for a casual adventure game, then Genshin is nice... but beyond that there is somehow so much to do and then a point nothing at all. Progress is time gated, you spend months to build a charactee but don't have any actual area in the game to fully use them and there are some many features to improve user experience but they refused to add them.",1
Scaramouche pls,5
I love it,5
Loadtime a bit high.,2
"Aku menyukai ini game. Dari segi Grafik bagus dan detail² Game nya juga menarik, banyak monster dan boss yg bisa kita lawan. Banyak karakter yg bisa kita juga dapatkan! Ayo buruan di dowload!",5
I love this game i literally super love qiqi!! But something wrong on dec5 2022 i chose american and it saids failed server try again later and i was shoked when i see it i was sad and it came to normal im happy again tysmmm so much genshin!!! Love yall❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️,4
Nak mona la <3,5
The best game,5
I accidentally took a shower and now i cant play😔,1
No comment Speechless,5
"It is a very good game , doesnt take much battery, but it takes a lot of power and storage which could make or break the wanting of this game",4
"This game is incredible. I do not understand how it is free. It's like the full open world of Skyrim meets Final Fantasy, and kind of Avatar, but with every climate and different cultures. Optional side quest around ever turn, tons of exitement. Your main character can switch elemental powers if they want in each new region. I've unlocked a map almost as big as Skyrim and the system is saying I've only unlocked 13%. There's hidden caves, treasure, enemies, high level quest. 10/10",5
the game is good but i am trying to log in to my account by using my UID from my ps4,3
Never in my Life have I played a mobile game this much.. BEST MMORPG OUT PERIOD.,5
"I've been playing since release and bought multiple crystal top ups, battle passes and welkins. The poor release of my most highly anticipated 5 star character (hint, starts with D and ends in ehya) has made me realise the game is not heading in a good direction. I was previously happy to spend money on characters and prepared to spend even more this time, but the way the developer has handled the current situation has made me severely lose interest in the game and making any future purchases.",1
Everything is great and i can't wait for anime,5
Very cool game with good quality and good features,5
This game is so good. Fun game. Finally reached 100 level,5
Nice game,5
Good,5
Fix Dehya,1
"I just can't find the motivation to play this game anymore , I love this game but I just can't continue this journey with genshin I'm so sorry",5
"Amazing. I just discovered Genshin Impact back in December, so I've missed out on a bunch unfortunately, BUT I've got to say that I've never played a game like this before. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL. The storyline is great, it snagged me from the moment I started playing. The game play is great, the only downside is that you're not able to connect your phone to a controller. Sometimes it can be a little tricky with the screen interface, as I'll sometimes use a burst by accident. Killer game!!!",5
"Gameplay is very good, I can adventurelike my imagination. But PLEASE! DRAGONSPINE UNDERGROUND IS VERY HARD! can you please remove the water at that place or at least make many plate for walk",3
"They released Dehya, a 5-star character with a trash and glitchy kit without any sinergy with itself and are ignoring the players complaints, I'm leaving the rating to 1/5 till they fix her. #FixDehya",1
"Hi again Genshin! I'm sorry to make an review again but, could you guys make a version of like just 12 gb? Like you can choose if you want the full version or not? Because again, it still consumes many storage and many people also want to play the game but they can't because they don't have enough storage like me. But if you don't want to add this it's alright. Also YOUR APP IS AMAZING. And I'm begging.",1
Amazing,5
Find a friend and enjoy the game,5
Just spectacular,5
I LOVE THIS IM SO ADDICTED TO IT GENSHIN TAKE MY MONEY IDC,5
Good game,5
Fix dehya,1
Nice👍,5
🤬 you 🤬 for not including controller support you pieces of 🤬. You're so 🤬 greedy. Include controller support you 🤬. A first-year programmer could do it. You're a bunch of low-life leaches. I hope you 🤬 are happy.,1
Very fun the game is always good keep it up,5
I like the game so much,5
Idk i just play,5
"Fun, try and you'll know what I mean.",5
"i love this game and its possibilities - the only complaints i have to maybe keep in mind is the huuuge amount of storage it takes(i had to switch devices 3 times to run it😅) and it also for sure has some paywalls for certain things. otherwise, kts definitely very fun and entertaining - amazing graphics, animation, and attention to detail and i do recommend it :))",4
Give me primogems,5
Super,5
i like its graphic and the open world review but i didnt installed it yet 😅,5
I think it'll be more fun if we could just Interact with the books and it will take us to the HoYoverse browser manga section just like in Honkai Impact......,5
"Good game, can't figure out how to redeem my 20 free wishes tho. Please help devs.",5
"It's fun and all but it does lunda get boring when you've finished all but that's not my main problem here, my oppo reno 3 is struggling with the game's graphics and I can't even see my own damage text and I don't know why. My phone runs on 128gb space and 11gb ram, octa-core proceddor too. Pls fix this",4
"It's Amazing but Can you add Grass,Text Damage,and Ice for Low end Devices it really helps us to improve the game Thank you!",3
love this game,5
Keep my garden,5
Im playing in vivo 1723 it has 64gb and 4 gb RAM but its still crashing can you fox it plsss😭,3
The best game I have ever played. Amazing animations nice story line and gives us quests to know more about the region. Overall a fun game to play.,5
Gud game,5
"Alot of Bugs, release a buggy character and doesn't listen to majority feedback, only wants your money #FixDehya",1
I wish it had lower storage usage,4
Nice game. Graphics are cool and gameplay is awesome.,5
"This game is nice infact, it's just boring for me right now because you log in the game, do your commissions, go to the Gacha banner, then pull. After that you don't get the character.but anyways,the graphics are good. The storyline is nice. But I just don't like the fact that when I leave, it automatically closes and when I do a story and I crash, I have to do the story all over again.",5
really a nice games i ever played but i stopped playing bc of my storage and my phone too old now so still saving my money for better device and back again to explore,5
A very good game,5
This game is so fun and so beautiful. The landscapes are so amazing and the lore and characters are so cool. I highly recommend this game:D,5
thank you genshin i wanted crit rate and dmg but you give me defence instead thank you i really need that defence,1
amazing,5
I really love this beautiful game and I hope u guys do to,5
it would not let me play after freeing space,1
It's so fun so cute I love how all the characters have their own element ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡,5
Does not play because of update of 20 gb,3
"SO my initial review was made in a bout of anger and I would like to correct myself. This is a fantastic game and I am unfortunately obsessed with it. However, latest char release was a huge disappointment and I really hope Mihoyo listens to their player base and buffs her because she's understandably caused a lot of upset for how terrible her kit is. I doubt it will happen, but I figured I'd comment on it anyway. Game is better on PC/console. Don't play it if you intend to have a life tho.",4
Interesting it piques my curiosity everytime and got addicted to collect the characters,5
very sad no dottore make me very sad i love dottore edit: i got cyno. genshin win goty,5
Dehya fix,1
"It's a nice game, actually I played this game 2years ago but I stop cause I don't like the quality of game bacause of it's many issue about graphic but now it's better to play I like it",5
bussin,5
I think it's a scam. It gives no code at all! the worst game in my life.,1
"this game need hella massive game engine optimization..... stutters and lags everywhere on sd870, meanwhile codm uses small hardware resources but you can play it with max settings 120fps",5
The only game i played that i loved! Ayaka's coming let her come please tgis would be my last patch!:((,5
I don't download it,1
I like this game i feel I'm in anime world ❤️,5
The only complaint I have is theres a level called anti shogun training and its extremely difficult to pass. Like WAY more difficult than it should be. Excessively difficult. Fighting the shogun is nothing like the training which is basically impossible to clear. Ive failed so many times that I decided to spend my time with other games. I buy in game quite often but Im not going to spend here at all anymore. Who wants to spend money on a game specifically designed to keep you from advancing...?,4
This is my quite place for healing... Beautiful Game,5
Im trying to sign in but it wont let me and it says i dont have any extra space to play when i deleted every app and game i own,1
Fix Dehya!,1
Gameplay is amazing but if you took out half of the dialogue there would still be way too much. Later on it gets so stupid there's a quest where somebody talks to you for 3 you literally walk about five feet and then you enter a conversation for about 2 more. The only people I know that like the dialogue use it to practice their Chinese. It gets extremely repetitive you'll find out they only really increase the stats not many new monsters,2
Why....This game is not opening.... Pls fix the problem 😅,1
Fix Dehya you dingus,1
"After the last update my joystick keeps moving without me touching it, it moves around for a good 3 seconds and then stops its so frustrating",3
i love this.,5
This is a really good game,5
Amazing best game ever,5
Fix Dehya,1
I love Genshin impact,5
Genshin is awesome u can do so much and the new city's are pretty,5
it is fun and it's super cool,5
seru,5
"While I love the game play, story, music, art, lore so much and spent hundreds of hours playing it over a year on PC and mobile, I was really dissatisfied with Dehya's kit and hope you fix it.",1
"Just started playing,,,,love it so far !! Wish I who'd had found it earlier",4
nice game good animetion for a mobile game and now it is one of my favourite game 😇😇,5
This game has changed my life and can't wait for a Eula rerun .... hoyo verse where is my waifu,5
"Love the story , character designs, world map , graphics and everything the only problem is that it takes 2-3 times just to start sometimes",4
It is the best game the graphics are amazing and overall good,5
Irresponsible company. Lots of issues with Dehya as well intentionally hindering her kit and usage compared to the quality of not just other standard 5* but also the 4* in the game. It makes you wonder if anyone actually tests anything before release. I've been so frustrated with a character I've been waiting for since 3.0 and this company basically spat in the face of all her fans. Absolutely unacceptable and what's worse is they haven't acknowledged it.,1
"Good game but I played it today it was fine but then my screen turned white can you fix that, and again it is a good game.",5
Nc,5
Best open world game,5
The game is fun to play,5
This game is awesome it helped me live and breathe this is so cool my children are gonna be born called genshin for the boy and impact for the girl,5
Always ma fav 𓆩♡𓆪,5
"Dehya's kit is riddled with issues. Low scaling, insane CD, energy issues. Even a low investment 4* can probably outclass her damage. Her burst also has issues, getting frozen mid combat canceling the burst, auto targeting getting messed up especially in Azdaha 2nd phase. I also submitted feedback through the ingame suggestion and received a standard copy paste bot response within seconds. The lack of response from HYV despite the communities' woes shows how little they care abt us",1
"For my First time playing, ngl it's really fun and has interesting plots. It's all more entertaining the some other games and I can see why this game is popular now.",5
One of my favourite game ...,5
"Bring a skip button , everything else all good",5
Your a npc if you install this,1
"I could not in good concious recommend any game made by hoyoverse. The company only cares about making a quick buck, they never listen to player feedback, have very low QA standards and they consistently release characters in a broken state to get you to spend to fix them with constellations. Dehya is the most recent example of this, she released in such a bad state that they put her in the trash and moved on rather than fix her many bugs and issues. Characters should be playable at C0.",1
FIX DEHYA,1
"Really enjoyed my time from 1.0 to 3.4 I've been a Ganyu main since update 1.2 I just can't see myself playing any longer due to the lack of quality in highly anticipated characters. Deyha was hyped up since the release of the dendro region 3.0 for up to 30 weeks. Upon her release. Her kit has released broken. Her ""tanking"" kit doesn't work at all, zero team synergies & her damage values are in 4 star character territory. Please up the standards of non archon characters #SaveDeyha",1
Please make it more compatible for other devices !!,2
"The game is good, but the developer has a disgusting attitude towards the players. The developer simply ignores it without giving any answers. The current events with Dehya are an example of this. To make a character that is worse than any 5* and can't even compete with a 4* free character, Noel, who does all the same features as Dehya, only better. This is wrong and disgusting. As well as ignoring the dissatisfaction of the players with this.",1
Fix Dehya. Hoyoverse is consistently releasing incomplete characters and selling us solutions to problems they created through constellations. It honestly feels like they don't care about the community and only want your money.,1

I love this game,5

"This is a deeply involved and unforgettable experience. It is a well-polished gem that blows mainstream RPG adventures out of the water. The characters are charming, and the voice acting is superb. It is steeped in excellent portrayals of culture and lore. Once you get started, you can't put it down. There's so much to do and experience that the battlepass is largely irrelevant; there is no paywall. But I will happily support development when I am able. The in-game support is amazing.",5
game burik,5
"I like it, the story, awesome graphics and amazing open world gameplay.",5
This game is amazing except it takes too much storage and it shows insufficient storage sometimes,4
"This game clearly has a lot of heart put into it, with what could be an interesting plot and interesting characters-- but the main story quest is such a bore, with hours and hours of unskippable dialogue that all seem to amount to the same thing, and little actual gameplay in comparison. Sometimes, you are forced to do character quests in addition, which also have way more dialogue than necessary. If there was a skip button to skip entire scenes, maybe it would be a bit better.",2
"My favorite game.the problem is it's not available on phones that could handle it.and it is available on a phone like this, which isn't able to download all of the recourses even when it was a brand new phone.for that I give 4 star instead of 5",4
"Developers I just uninstalled it because of storage issue it's crossing the storage limit, it used to be 2 GB only now 20+GB.Just low the storage of game or make a lite version of this game (Genshin impact lite) pls i need to continue the game pls developers🙏",2
"This game is amazing!! The graphics are gorgeous and it's very entertaining I've played it for a year now and so far I've been enjoying it, if you wanna download this game go for it you won't regret it, I would highly recommend it ♥️♥️♥️",5
Pretty sure 95/100 people would give this 5* i mean....this has godlike graphucs and chill gameplay. Though it's hard at first to fight enemies. Once you level up.you can one shot almost everything.it's fun but addictive😭,5
I'm giving it one star because what I try to download the resources it says insufficient storage space and I have the sufficient storage .So please hoyoverse help me because I am a new player and I haven't played the game yet.,1
"Is there any chance you guys buff dehya of rework her,Because you announced that she is a support and going into standard banner,her first problem is,Her kit and constellation isnt for a support,its for a dps,2 c6 dehya doesnt get maximum benefit of her signature weapon,3 she is a standard banner character but her ascension material is hard for newbies to get,4 her burst is for dps and her skill isnt even that good,it has long downtime and doesnt appy pyro fast,in conclusion dehya kit is trash",1
Need more features in game. Mak3 me bored after daily quest,3
"Fix your bug on android, i can't open the game",1
Good but give me luck please,5
"Seems like y'all lost your passion for giving us an enjoyable experience recent events, characters and story have been quite lackluster. Only good new characters for sumeru was Nahida and Wanderer. Only good event was latern right. A lot of us no longer look forward to the new characters and story. Get it together and listen to what the what the community has to say.",1
"Fix Dehya and stop creating problems for your characters that can only be ""fixed"" with constellations.",1
I love it,5
Genshin's new direction on designing character is bad. Last straw was Dehya. Fix her.,1
So sexy gaming experience,5
"Really like the game, but cannot give a good review as they falsely advertised Dehya as a powerful character and she is weaker than most 4 starts, which is unheard of for a 5 star limited character.",1
The game is so cool ans it runs smoothly- I like it! B),5
I don't like this game Not start this game😞😞😞,5
Why every dark character get low dmg or low expectations? Hoyoverse racist?,1
Releasing absolutely awful characters with misleading advertising. Don't support this company.,1
By far the lost time consuming and yet the most worth it game. Gambling habbit takin over me help.👽,5
"best game I have experience . Great graphics , with anime theme . And big world to explore with interting villain and elemental attack",5
This game give me knowledge and yes i like to play it i need zaddy al haitam 🗿👍,5
"Insufficient storage space to download past the title screen, and this game looks fun possibly a great game, but mobile platforms are not meant for console sized games, and I bought this tablet last year, not a complaint, but I can play nearly all other games, I can only imagine how many people have the same iasue (A lot)",1
"Repetitve and boring monthly events! There is less main story,,,the game has become very boring. Review from someone that played it 2 months after release until Dec22!",3
". I absolutely love it, but there is a minor problem that needs to be fixed. In sumeru, the enemy's hp disappear whenever i tried to eliminate them on my mobile phone. Overall, this game is fantastic. I hope you can fix it",5
"After update, when I open the Genshin Impact after press launch, It's crash.",1
Best and very high graphics it's amazing,5
Dehya is a broken character that is not good at anything. Will change rating when characters are fixed.,1
Fix Dehya. Utterly unacceptable.,1
This is so good game when you want to adventure,5
"The games great but you guys should really do something about the storage. In a few years, the game wouldn't be compatible on mobile devices if you keep this up.",5
"Gamenya keren, grafiknya bagus, trus bagus alurnya dan ada suaranya. Dan aku baru maen dua mingguan doang, udh dapet hero bintang 5 waw. Tapi kalo baru donlot itu udh makan aja tuh device nya, gede amat ampe 9 gb, itu pake data si abis tu :) grafik haru ""ter""rendah si, soalnya aku jg pake yang rendah, itu bar nya merah, jd ku balikin lagi. Tapi bagus ni game, tapi kayanya game terlalu makan banyak memori, soalnya dari yang kosong 30 gb skrg jadi 20 gb_- tapi bagus ni game serasa kebawa ke game👍",5
Luv it,5
very cool game,5
Dehya,1
Story getting darker ...like it,4
For the dialogue can you please put a skip button please 🥺🥺🥺,5
Acknowledge the problems in your game and fix it. Fix the problem with Dehya.,1
At first I thought it was going to be fun but it keeper saying insanifasint storage so I deleted some apps but it keeped saying it and I never got to play it so in the future if you could change this please do. I would nit recommend this app if you have poor storage.,2
Fix Dehya.,1
Please add backbone controller support!!,3

Great game so far. Free to play is very possible to achieve.,5
Please make cats petable,1
"Well current update is not very satisfying, they make a good story indeed but the current characters feels underwhelming.",4
Hearing the emergency foods voice being too high most of the times made me sick of playing the game.,2
Best game ever,5

Overall superb been playing it for a month now and as an f2p it is a great game Edit: come on mihoyo I'm a little disappointed about the anniversary,5
Absolutely insanely amazing game (left post on the App store too)...Who says this game is a bad game ....he never played in his life a REAL game on console or PC.... AMAZING game,5
So fun,5
It's addictive and a fun game,5
Genshin is so nice,5
👎,1
Character wishes are already expensive with pity system and you went ahead and release another 5-star character with such glaring issue. Way to listen to the player base.,1
Love it,5
"I'm disappointed with the lack of communication between Hoyoverse and it's community, this has been an issue for a long time and now in 3.5 they released an unfinished, bug ridden, character. The game's quality is starting to plummet. Please just fix Dehya and listen to the community who supports your business. #FixDehya Edit: I have emailed and reported Dehya's problems but they have yet to be fix nor has Hoyoverse officially say something about it.",1
FIX DEHYA,1
"Its nice but not great, Lots of stories but many quests. Its hard to attack enemies, time consuming on artifacts weapons,making characters powerful. But the story or the lore its very great.",3
Fix Dehya!,1
"I hate to do this to you, Hoyo, since I love this game, but since you're not listening atm, I have to join the others in the #FixDehya campaign, because this is the 5-star character that you have done the dirtiest with. She is barely usable at C0 with a burgeon build and even then any other pyro character, even a 4-star, can perform the same role. PLEASE we beg you, listen to the community and fix Dehya's numerous flaws in her kits. It is a shame that an incredible character was butchered.",2
Very addicting game in a positive way,5
No words ..just awesome 👌,5
I don't have words for how amazing this game is,5
Awesome I love the story so much...it is really sad but it's fun I promise who will download this it's awesome try it,5

Very good experience for me,5
"The game gets stale in Mid-game I played for 10 days about 5 hours every day. I didn't get good characters so i was in a position to develop characters that i don't want and forced to play for primogems(used for getting characters) and had so less to do as compared to starting days The game has great graphics and story but takes too much time, or else you can substitute with money Doesn't suit for me Thank you",4
Iy,5
One of the best game i seen ever. Best open world game.graphic are so realistic. It's awesome game .i love it,5
Butchered my favourite character. Hopefully she will get fixed.,1
I love this game so much but it takes a lot of space and I wish that there was a thing that you could only play genshin impact that could hold all the space,5
"The game is vast and good . The only problem is i can't play in max quality bczz of overheating+frame rate drop . But i manage to play at medium settings, it's all good i would love to see what is next ,there are so many characters it's hard to pick",5
This game makes me not to go outside again,5
Need AUTOPLAY,1
20GB data for this game is too much... better to lower data,1
It's one of my favorite games. Love this game it is F2P friendly. I purchase things myself. I have almost all of the units and a lot of their 5 star sig weapons. It gets updates monthly. The story of the game and all the different people and personalities you meet on your journey is awesome. The story will touch you somewhere in it or a character will. It's one of the games I will never forget. I put it up there in my top 5 favorite games of all time. You won't regret playing it.,5
"Good game but Artifacts grinding is hard Unfair game gives good stuff to paid to play peoples😓, but favorite game of mine Stopped playing due to reasons Maybe play in future",4
It is a very good and fun game,5
"I really don't know what to write here! I played this game since the first month but now somehow someone unlinked my account from my email without I get any notification, I tried to contact the support but they rejected the ticket even that I have all the payments that's I made in my account I will not stop trying to contact them till I get my account back,hoyoverse please be more supportive to the players those like ur game I worked hard on my account dont let the hacker get it for free please",1

I became a discord mod 5/5,5
stop making trash character,1
"Hoyoverse needs to address and own up to the lack of testing on character kit and disregard of beta testing feedback on said kit of character. The recent 5* Dehya has released completely buggy and lacking in coherence of character role in her kit. Many fans have reported the bugs and issues with her kit, and yet Hoyo has remained silent on the matter. The atrocious state of her release should be an omen for any future 5 star characters going forward.",2
"I sooo love this game , I can't get enough of it and the music ,chstactes and environment are amazing. As a game dev I am soooo impressed",5
Such a wonderful n easy to understand gameplay,5
Nice game,5
Devs don't listen to theirs community... That's so sad. GO BUFF ////D//É/hYÀ,1
This is so annoying and I need it to be fixed I have a bug where when I level up an artifact my atk goes down so until it's fix this gets a one star,1
I spend money in this past year and want to pay for dehya sadly kit so bad it ruins the game. Not gonna spend anymore from now on if this is how they give characters.,1
Works great on my Moto G Stylus 5g and is a beautiful game to behold,5

The new most anticipated 5-star character that got me to start playing Genshin turned out to be the worst 5-star ever. Scammed.,1
Fix dehya,1
Excellent Game,5
Great game but is a shame that the company doesn't listen to the player feedback after they released a a very poor optimized character that is practically unusable in a bunch of occasions and limiting the options of gameplay,1
Its great very cool yey wow yeas thats it actually idk what else to say now,5

"It'd be a 5 star review if it didn't need so much space, have this game on PC and tablet in case my tablet can't take it anymore at some point. Kinda sad that has to be a constant worry",4

Hard to login when your in mobile 🤧🤧,1

I just love it 😻,5
please buff dehya,1
"Waited for SEVERAL months to spend money to pull for Dehya (a 5-star character that is supposed to be decent) only for her to be basically non-functional in any of her supposed roles at her release. The design of her gameplay is half-baked and unacceptable and needs to be addressed. Future characters could be designed this way as well, and I will not tolerate it.",1
Top-notch story and fun gameplay.,5
Hello I'm arjun I love it's game but game not starting my mobile ????,4
anniversary rewards suck,3
Fix Dehya,1
Changing my review from 5* to 1* until they fix dehya,1
"Disappointed with the 1 anniversary rewards... if the rewards for the 1 anniversary get better i'll change my review. Edit: Just good rewards wont change the communty disappointed with communication about it now, it has come to a point that we need an official appologie!",1
For a mobile that's a very solid and a nice looking game. I'm not a fan of anime but I like it.,5
Standard banner is just the worst! At least make it so you can choose what 5 star weapon or character you want to get. Cuz is very frustrating this way and im reeeally thinking of deleting this game now,1
OK,5
Perfect game i love this game,5
I am extremely disappointed with how Dehya ended up and more so in the lack of communication from Hoyoverse. What's the point in having a customer feedback system if they don't even listen to us? I don't think I'll be returning to the game or spending money until something gets done.,1
Fix dehya,1
Your a simp if you play this game,1
Amazing,5
Good game 🎮,5

The slightest internet issues and your character just dies. What's the point of having this on a phone if you can't play it. Greedy hoyoverse,1
#Fix Dehya...,1
Best mobile game to ever exist fr thanks for making this.,5
Incredible game massive open playing field good quest lines all you can want in an rpg...,5
I just wanna thank the developers for their effort to make this masterpiece the graphics the story the characters all are amazing just fix the file amount,4
The game is good with light to moderate things to do endgame. Doesn't make you feel like it's a job. XD,5
"I really enjoy playing genshin impact and it's the only game where I grind everyday. It's the first game where i spend a lot, not that many but for me who doesn't have a work i think it is a lot. Happy Anniversary! Its my first time reviewing a game with a long message. Btw keep up the good work! I hope that there will still be a lot of new events and contents in the future. Thank you for this wonderful game :)",5
so traaash game fk this,1
I love this game so much,5
nice game but cheap with 5 star heroes am 30 rank with 0 5star hero i even begin to hate the game,5
Great game!,5
Amazing game but so big every update is massive,4
Greedy company that doesn't listen to its community,1
I couldn't play the game and it wouldn't load,1
The game is too heavy . Make it lite,2
"Went to play this on my phone as I've got it on PS5....although the game is good it's getting 1* because of the 20gb initial download size. Absolute joke. File size is unnecessary, just shows Devs don't delete old unused files, they just keep adding on top.",1
"Ok so ngl, but i love the game like so much. It has the amazing story, the graphic, great character design and more. My only problem (and probobly other players' problem) is that it's really hard to get a 5 star character or the character you want, especially if you're a f2p player. Besides of that, it's really an amazing game fr",5
Mihoyo really trashed Dehya,1
"I happened to play this game during free times at work, but sometimes it opens up saying it conforms to need to download it and if I don't it kicks me off of the game. Sometimes I don't need to download it just to play it.",3
"Amazing storyline, soundtrack and visuals! The recent sumeru quests were so good it completely changed my opinion of the game. Couldn't help but shed tears for nahida and also some of the npcs (karakata)",5
I love it absolutely gorgeous graphics and characters,5
Amazing Pretty,5
"Going into 3 years with nearly no real direct, substantial improvement - only expansion after expansion after expansion. Devs seems to be out of touch and feedbacks don't seem to be taken into consideration unless they align with what they intended to do in the first place. Most recent character (as of writing this review) seems to be designed terribly on purpose only to sell more gacha. Disappointing.",1
Fix deyha and Candace,1
"Easily the best mobile game that I've ever played. The graphics, storyline, characters; literally everything is top notch. Archon Quests is the main storyline but even if you complete that there is just so much content available that you won't get bored. I do have a few complaints though regarding the 160 resin cap, the limit of 150 markers; both of which needs to be increased. Most importantly I hate that there is no way to change the controls which means you are stuck with the default controls",5
Excellent. Just like ps4 version,5
Best open world game in mobile,5
Its the most beautiful game in the whole world,5
We like the game hoyo please work hard and give us more exploration,4
"I absolutely LOVE this game! Ever since I started playing this Genshin Impact, it has become a huge part of my life and has a huge impact on the person I am becoming. It has taught me about love, compassion, kindness and the importance of helping people in our life. Not to mention the BEAUTIFUL lore of the game, the graphics, the art and THE MUSIC!!! So I have to give a BIG THANK YOU to Hoyoverse and EVERYONE involved in the making of this game❤️. You all are doing great!!! Keep going!!!",5
Trash,1
"Game hay. Đồ họa đẹp, cốt truyện có chiều sâu, game play quá tốt, nhưng mong nhà phát triển bổ xung thêm điều khiển bằng gamepad cho android nữa là tuyệt.",4
I can't enter in the game,3
have played this game since launch. still going strong. i love this game. it honestly is never a dull moment when playing. its so good!!!!!,5
I love this game very much but the reason why I gave it 1 star is bc the storage it annoys me I reset every game and it still didn't work I had no choice to delete it,1
Fix Dehya pls,5
Women wrestling games,1
I can't enter to this game can I know the reason?,1
It's amazing but the old characters were better.,5
Listen to your community for the love of god Hoyoverse #FixDehya,3
I cant believe I will be leaving the genshin community I loved this game and even more after Dehya. I skipped so many reruns and banners because Hoyo hyped and designed her so well now she is extremely underwhelming and her dps capabilities are lower than Xianling. A very buggy kit. It upsets me alot when it shouldnt as its just a game but oh well i love Dehya and would have loved to see her in complete glory... :(((,1
THIS IS THE BEST RPG GAME EVERRRR,5
It is fun at the start then you finish everything and it became boring,3
This game is just fantastic,5
Really good,5
Op games and so sexy hot chackters,5
"Game is fun until you start artifact rolling. To much layers of RNG in this one... to get some pretty good artifacts, you are probably gonna deal with burnout. Beside this game have amazing stories, quests, big open world with many great characters to meet",4
yes but my phone maybe just hate it. I just have 64 GB so i cant play it any more. At least i like this game so much and maybe someday i Will play it again. :>,4
I love it,5
This is my first time playing genshin impact and I really love it the game is amazing and the art work is so beautiful,5
"This game is very interesting with deep lore and lots of quests, the events are great however being a noble player there's glitches and you can't log into any other type of device like a PC for example, it will have the same username and password but will make you restart sadly, but progress will stay on your phone",5
Amazing game but I'll keep my rating as low as possible until there's proper endgame content and Dehya is fixed,1
"A good game overrode with generic npc quests. We don't get to know this world through the large playable cast, everything is explained and told by copy-paste npcs and the world quests do not include the playable characters at all. Things would be a whole different if the world quests were balanced. The game would be more immersive if we could meet the playable cast in world quests of their respective regions while keeping npc quests to a minimum.",2
"I SERIOUSLY LOVE THE GAME!😍 but two things cut my interest is: 1) everytime i opened the game, it takes some minutes up to 5-7 minutes to wait it for downloading resources (not 1st time), verifying file integrity, load data and such. it kinda break the mood to play the game. 2) the app was huge and it made my phone overheating even tho I'm using gaming phone. Hope in the future the app wont be too huge than now.",4
冰冻水面不显示,1
Daehya needs to be Fix. Low ER particles or below average for sub DPS. Not good for burgeon. Her off field Target Enemies only not dendro cores Even whales have still problem in her kit. Her C6 doesn't resonate with her signature weapon passive. Does not gain 100% value with C6 Daehya When she got freeze during burst the only button for unfreezing is jump button which cause to cancel her burst when jumping. Low Scaling for Elemental skill and Burst it needs more HP% or Atk% for better sub dps.,1
خیلی بازی باحالی هست,5
Fix the bug in jail quest where u need to enter secret fix it the chatting start and the full game get frozen fix it and system requirements for one quest will change? What a joke and auto generated msg,1
"We're asking for just one thing. FIX DEHYAS ABILITIES! We just need you to make her a playable character just like the rest of character. The way you put them in the game has a lot of issues and stuff that make her unplayable. We're not asking to fix her eyes, stop making fun of us, the community.",1
Can't log in,1
too cute!!,5
"Quite dissatisfied with the fact that you could release a character (Dehya) in such an unfinished state. Please address this, similarly to how you addressed Zhongli in the past. Please show that you have concern for the playerbase's concerns.",1
Just look up dehya issues. The company more or less doesn't care about you or anything as you would expect. It just gets exhausting to play a game where the developers constantly make questionable decisions and just flat out ignore everyone if it doesn't affect their sales,1
Sorry I need to uninstall the game after event 3.5 because lack of space Nice meeting this game bye genshin impact our memories I will never remember it.,3
I really love the world and the story of genshin! The amount of exploration(the amount of times i swiped) is so much fun ;A;,4
"could you please add Shop Item like ""MC Change"" so i can swap my Lumine for Aether? i don't care how much it cost, but please add it.",5
I love it . 😀😀😀,5
Wonderful,5
mwaaa,5
It's a good game ig.,5
It's a damn good game I started game playing very late after release but still it feels worths investing my time in the game,5
This game is AMAZING! but I rate it four because you sorta... Deleted my account. I made so much progress and now I have to restart ☹️ I hope you can fix this,4
Amazing game,5
I have 20GB if space but still says the same thing,1
Fix dehya.,1
Perfect 🌟,5
#fixDehya Hoyo you really disappeared me after Realising such A good Character Design With weak Kit. Please fix Dehya Kit she deserves it.,1
"Great game. Lots of free content available especially during events, but if you want to collect all the characters and min max then be prepared to spend some money. *Lowered to 2 stars because of how Dehya was released. The character, that people spend real money on, was released in a janky, unbalanced, and untested state that borders on false advertising. She has bugs that affect her performance and value. It is unacceptable and shakes confidence in the company to provide value for money.",2
I don't like men,5
Good game but it always shows connection time out... Even I have excellent network (5g),3
Me quitaron homa😭,1
the gameplay is nice just farming for stuff is worst than being shot in the head and 103gb?! No thanks..,1
I have played for 700 days plus with 880 achievements with 40 character owned properly build. My rates... Music:S VA:S Animation/Cutscene:S Scenery:A Exploration:A Lore:A Interface:A Battle:B Story:B Quest:B Event:B Permanent content:C Thats all from me.. thx,5
You guys are all fat,1
"Please.. don't make fun of your players.. hear them when they complain something about the game. Just like the new 5* character Dehya that is so underwhelming. A 5* should be better than 4* characters, why won't you buff Dehya just to be on par with other 5* as it should be. Buff Dehya, if not make the future 5* characters not bad like her. Otherwise i'm totally losing interest to this game...",1
Nice game i love it,5
It great!,5
Hello the frozen account time is maybe too long because 20 minutes waiting was definitely not worth it! I suggest you put it down to 5-10 minutes. Maybe your trying to secure the players account but 20 minutes is really a waste!! Thank you for reading(?) I hope you can fix this problem.,3
my account got hacked 😠😠,1
The best game l every play in my life ❤ .,5
"Recent character ""Dehya"" is not usable and needs to be fixed",1
gooddd game! it has good graphics and a good mmorpg game. I'm looking for more upd!!<33,5
uwywu I got hu tao,5
"Underpeforms on mobile, the game is great on pc but on mobile, even at lowest settings it severely underperforms, to the point I would say it isn't playable",1
"Sucky game, Devs can barely make characters that aren't extremely pale (and even the couple characters that aren't are whitewashed heavily), and overall got really boring really quickly",1
The game is good but we want villain characters to be playable without redemption arc,4
"i already rate it out of 5/5 Even though i still haven't played it yet.., because of the high storage space and i already found it EXTREMELY AMAZING wish it would be 1-2 gb yet 20gb won't handle my device",5
Very bad,1
I lope this gamee!!,5
FIX DEHYA!!!!!,1
I hate the genius invocation TCG. The roll phase is so unfair that the elements I get are always different from each other or they're not the ones for my characters but of course the bots are lucky enough to have the perfect matches of their elements. Otherwise the game itself is nice,4
I just finish the archon quest that need to save nahida and when i finally see 1st dendro archon erase herself it made me cry hard i didnt expect that cause it's my first time crying in video games in my whole life and i wish that this game have the best ending so i can cry again that hard😭❤️❤️,5
Been playing the game since launch was extremely fun played it every day as an ar 57 now I am completely bored of the endgame I've spent a good amount of money but characters or nee story can't get me back into this game,1
Fix Dehya,1
"Never played a game like this in my life. I am amending my review I've played this game since launch and why it's beautiful and the story it's self good I am an end gamer as such I look forward to events. I've seen good changes and bad. Windblume has always been one of my faves, the harp soo hard don't bother, want to relax have fun or enjoy and event don't bother Downloading this game, they just want to make things harder each year till it's undoable, congrats you succeed mahiyo x",2
actually idk,5
Best Game Ever. Has amazing graphics and visuals.,5
Genshin is so addicting wth 100% recommend it's very good game I like murdering the cryo regisvine lol,5
"I tried, I really REALLY tried to like and enjoy this game. But unfortunately it just wasn't worth it. Next to Fire Emblem Heroes, this has the worst Gacha system ever.",1
It does not rise at all 😐,1
Poiman bacot,2
This is a great game and I have been playing it for a year now. But there is a thing that keeps me worried. Its the storage. Hoyoverse I know you love sumeru but can you take a break for creating new maps? It takes a alot of space I mean look at Sumeru its already huge and you're making it more huger @-@. Orr you can clean up some resources again? If this reach the limits of my storage im sure not just me but alot of users have to quit because of the storage issues.,4
Excellent game I love it :D,5
FIXDEHYA MHY PURPOSELY MAKE DEHYA BECIME WORST 5 STAR CHARACTER FIX THAT MHY,2
OMG Good👁️👄👁️,5
👍,5
Nice game,5
"just love this game , it has cool character design , story , and many other isekai stuff , the best free game out there for an otaku to play , the storage can be a issue on Android as update keep on coming and your storage is not enough",5
The download takes too long my wifi is good it can install really fast but in genshin it takes so long,1
"Took down my 3 star negative review and changed it to 5 stars. The game graphics are beautiful, the story is intriguing, the voice acting is amazing, the music is diverse, the content is perfect, and the gacha system doesn't matter if you've been playing for a long time. If you're patient you'll eventually get the characters you want. Definitely the best and most unique mobile game, 10/10 recommend downloading it!",5
Thb this game is Fantastic but it really making my phone explode from all the GB,5
Fix your control seting. Other nice,5
i just started playing this game on January and i really like it so far. More updates will be appropriated!!,5
War ma ee samays Mooyo,5
Nerf characters and they don't listen to the fans.,1
"Overall, it's a 3 star. I'm now AR55 The graphics are great, the storyline and lore is just the greatest and main part of this game. My only problems are, as you rank up e.g. through 45 you'll encounter some problems, you need to have some good luck in order to get good artifacts and stuff to build your characters. Many people don't really want to invest time, and grinding primogems are a pain if you want a 5 star to make the world level easier. I'm still willing to play it I love the storyline.",3
BRO why is there so much data and you have to download it?💀,5
I can't even play 😡,1
Best Game I Ever Played but the only problem is storage size,5
So it's a great game it does run the battery out quickly but I spend most of my time on genshin I highly recommend. I highly recommend! The characters are amazing I love the animation of the game and the characters. I love the updates and I cant wait to see where it is going!!!! There really isn't a game like this one! The negative reviews aren't exactly relevant (the people talking about bad character design) I love this game and this is probably the best thing that's ever happened to me!,5
Justice for Dehya,1
This is the best world exlploring game ever! Amazing graphics but needs alot of storage,5
It reminds me of console games in a nice way nice game,5
this game sucks,1
"This is an edited review, prev 2 stars. Previously, the anniversary dilema along with other issues caused my initial 5 star to drop. Now, it's a straight 1 due to the release of Dehya, a character with no synergy, low scaling, little purpose, buggy gameplay and burst, hyped for a year and dropped on standard patch. Absolutely silly they're releasing her in her broken state. There can be no excitement for future characters is one can be so absolutely, utterly underwhelming and unsatisfying.",1
"such an amazing game, i love this game so much",5
"The game is great, I've played it on PC, but when I try to play it on my chromebook, it crashes when loading data around 30% complete. I tried to reinstall it and it is always the same.",1
The horrendous way that they treat their darker skinned characters such as Dehya and cyno and xinyan is utterly disgusting. #buffdehya,1
Waste of money 💰,1
"very poor game balance, new 5 star was entirely underwhelming.",1
I love it but it needs to update control settings outher then that's it's amazing but a long mobile download but besides that it's awesome!!!,4
This game sucks first I barely got it had to wait 1 hour for it to load then it said 20 free wishes in the pull s for a new character I got 0 pulls😡,1
لابعه حاله,5
The game balance is not looking good for the future with them releasing worse and worse balanced characters. Dehyea is proof that their balance team has no idea what they are doing and are fine with releasing characters like this with no plans to buff them. Gacha gamers beware: Your future waifu may come out just like this,2
Game is good but i feel some lag,5
2 years in and still no content apart from very mid quests and recycled events,1
Pretty good so far,4
"Latest character, Dehya, has a lot of bugs already well known in the community. Hoyoverse so far has not officially addressed these issues.",2
😂,5
"This game is fun to play, and more fun with friends, so i really recomend it with friends:)",4
Rating 2 for some reasons. I was expecting in a game like that PVP fights events to fight with other online players the quests can be done automatically without needing to travel all of the distance i know we can use teleport but still annoying to travel it's boring to be alone in the game the feeling of online players moving around u in the city or even the world would give a better gaming experience overall I won't play a game like that all what I'm doing doing quests leveling up and that's it,2
"I can't even turn on the game, whenever I try to it just shuts down or doesn't get past the elements loading screen",1
"i have good impression about this game good grapics,story.I have a request can you make the game more optimized to help others to play much lag free",4
Fun a little slow controls take a little time but overall pretty cool game so far I've heard pay barriers are in this game but haven't encountered one in the first 2 days of play....well see,4
"Please just add a skip button. You guys know not everyone wants to sit through all the lengthy dialogue. It ruins the game having to wait and listen to the story for 10 minutes when it's not even that interesting. Other than that, the game is fine.",3
"changed my review to 1 star. im usually against making these kinds of reviews but hyv needs to do something about dehya because they did her so bad. and i mean REALLY BAD. she's a 5 star, come on!- people saved for months to get her and this is what you give them?? a poorly balanced character not worthy of being released yet! do better! you cant keep doing this for your future characters... all time low on hyv's part, very disappointing. slowly losing my respect #FixDehya",1
"The story is incredible. The gameplay and learning the system makes it even better. There is always so much to do and truthfully, there will always be more no matter how much you play! This game is my favorite and I love it so much.",5
"Imma go straight to the point lmao. The game is good, BUT the anniversary rewards is just ugh. Even the daily commissions give better rewards",5
"Beautiful game with amazing art, but it's perhaps the least free-to-play game I have ever played on mobile. There seems to be pretty much no way to get new heroes without spending money. Which is sad because there are so many cool heroes and you need different elements and abilities to complete quests. Also wow it takes up a lot of space on your phone. 😅",3
Remove this TCG game,1
"Best game ever, the storyline its awesome",5
"I hope soon the conversation could improve, like an open mic.",5
This game takes up so much storage and it is always laggy even though my wifi is perfectly fine.,1
amazing,5
"I love this game so much , As a fan of anime it gives same vibes as anime while playing it. The graphics are so clean, and it's story line is awesome and mainly it's wish system,I don't why some people hate it but I love it so much , It creates a suspense when we wish on it. And by the way the draw back of this game is it's storage. Mihoyo please create an option to transfer all the game files into SD card the storage in my internal drive is not enough so please, please create it.",5
Fix dehya,1
This game need Mobile player available to use gamepad,4
GREAT GAME. I love the graphics and all the cool characters. I would love if it was easier to get new charictors. and pets. But overall it's a good game to play.,5
No controller support on Android. #FixDehya,1

"Well the dev got better and I don't mind spending money on the game, as long as its worth it.",5
For now I have no quest 😒 so it's not fun 😕,1
"Dehya end up with a lot of bugs and a lot of problems, need a lot of changes",1
"From 2021 to 2023 I think Genshin impact is a really good game, it might just be my opinion but I really enjoy playing it. From the well good deals and graphics it's so much more fun and the characters gameplays are such cheif kiss but there's just a little problem. It takes a lot of space for most players but understandable of how well detailed the game is and also it lags at random times but out of all that i recommend the game! Enjoy travelers 🤍.",4
#Fix and buff Dehya.,1
"Playing for the first time in a while, and I can't even load into the game without it saying ""Not enough memory to complete this action."" I have deleted several games, yet it still won't work. Plus it said something special would happen on my birthday, and it's coming up soon ( March 12). I don't know what else to do. Edit: I don't check the playstore often. But I finally did and I'll probably delete the game until I can get a device with enough storage. Thanks for the advice!",2
"Great game, graphics highly recommended!",5
Amazing game on all platforms. If cyberpunk didn't come out this year this would probably be game of the year.,5
"#FixDehya Hoyoverse seems to think it's ok to spit in the face of the players by releasing characters that people were excited for with drastically underpowered kits and then locking the pieces that make them functional behind paywalls via constellations. If they do it with Dehya, there's no reason they won't continue to do so with future characters. This is an issue to all fans of the game whether you like Dehya or not. This review won't be changing until Hoyo fixes the numerous bugs in her kit",1
"This is, hands down, the best mobile video game experience you can get. (March 17, 2021) March 9, 2023: It's been more than a week after Dehya's release (3.5) and Hoyoverse still has no actual response to the huge number of complains about Dehya's underwhelming and buggy kit. For a 5star character that's been the most anticipated since the release of Sumeru 3.0, we're all truly dissapointed on how Hoyoverse is handling this matter. #FixDehya #BuffDehya",2
very good i liked,5
"In general, the game is not bad, it is quite addictive, which makes you plunge into the interest more and more, completing tasks and much more. however, the game is sometimes confusing at some points. But overall, the game is pretty good. I'll give 4 stars out of 5.",4
Update downloading simulator,1
your fandom is horrible but the overall game is very fun and grindey,5
I love it,5
For Dehya! Fix Dehya,1
"This game is lovely and I had been enjoying it since release. Unfortunately, I am lowering my rating because recent content has been disappointing, *especially* the reuse of models. Still fun to play, just less than before. I would also mention the storage problems, but that's to be expected of a game that's this high-quality. I have also seen people complain about lazy responses to complaints, and many have posted similar-looking screenshots of Hoyo replies. Please make some changes!",2
Nice. Great characters and physiology. Great plot and amazing graphics. Great game with breathtaking characters and music. Top level voice over. But the download took me like half day in PC.,5
"They released a character riddled with issues and haven't formally addressed it for more than a week. Seems they don't care about their customers. (Will update this if they fix it) Also, they haven't added another new endgame mode, even though the game has been out for more than 2 years.",2
Really love the game,5
"I actually enjoy this game, however the most recent character released full of bugs and drastically worse than other characters and the lack of actual communication from the company isn't giving me a lot of faith in them.",3
"Since the launch of Sumeru, the character kit design quality has gone down to beyond mediocre levels. The 4 stars are straight up not worth using (save one or two at 7 total copies) and most of the 5 stars seem to be scaled back on purpose. It is sad because the kit quality used to be top tier and now it just feels like they are intentionally gimping characters so that you fomo into pulling more copies. What happened to releasing complete characters at C0? New players will never know.",1
What can I say is a perfect mobile game,5
Damn man the uh gotdamn It's fun definitely not the most Free to play friendly game iv ever played and it could use some controller support on Android but other than that it's pretty fun,5
"Terrible el estado en el que se lanza el contenido de este juego, 2 años y no son capaces de testear sus nuevas actualizaciones? No se lo recomiendo a nadie, y mucho menos otros productos de hoyo verse como honkai star trail",1

One star until they buff Deyha.,1
Love it,5
How do you play,5
The issue is first it's too big for me it's okay but for my friends it's too much for them and also I don't see a multi-player option 😕 if u reduced the GB and then I will give 4 stars,3
i like genshin inpact but i think some of the challenges are way to hard.,4
Please fix Dehya,1
GOOD,5
Fun but it takes a long time to load:),5
"Guardian tales is 100% better in all aspects except graphics. Gameplay? It's better. The entire concept of summoning? It's better. Characters? Better. Story? Probably the best I've seen. Unlike genshin where you have to spend your entire life savings on 2 characters, or keep playing for a year to get any good characters, in guardian tales you can be completely free to play and still be able to get the best characters / any character of your choice. It's even better in terms of community.",1

Happy anniversary genshin,5
"Just fix dehya already. We don't need her to be overpowered, we just want her to actually be fun to use. Also, get a new gameplay balancing team. #FIXDEHYA",1

#BuffDehya GIVE HER A GOOD KIT SHE DESERVES ITTT,1
yeah it aight,5
The game is super fun and the characters designs the plot the graphics are soooo beautiful to be honest not so difficult to get the the characters but it be more easy if the pity system was modified to a lower rate of guarantee 5*like 80 something otherwise a good game,4
No me deja acceder a mi cuanta de América arreglen esta cosa Ya que en el servidor de asia si me deja acceder,1

Cringe and scam. Apparently also racist. All dark skinned characters are weak? -10000 social credits,1

Love it cant quit playing,5
I love this game,5
I LOVE THIS GAME,4
Love it,5
Good game,5
"Because of that mfing ad of that dude who looks like who escaped jail promoting genshin. I can't do it anymore, every time he pops out in my social medias.. I have this urge to KMS. He won't stop hunting me down with those PROMOTION....ENOUGH IS ENOUGH #blessed",1
Sorry for the bad comment I had a bad day from the hospital and snow but I recommend this game to new players who love games like this but should I pick female twin or male twin idk which to pick,5
It's a good game with high graphics but the size of game is too big after the download. So try to make lighter version of this game,4
Thanks hoyoverse for making this game more miserable,1
Since the new update my game won't load. Something is wrong with this patch. I love this game but this is very upsetting.,5
Fix Dehya because it is triggering my anxiety.,1
This game is just.. TOO GOOOD I love the artstyle and everything super good graphics!,5
One of the best game 😍 now i know why most people love it,5
it has little girls,5
There was absolutely no need to Nerf Alhaitham. Worst game ever. Alhaitham was probably the first op character I have. There are plenty of high dmg dealing characters but you haven't nerfed.,1
"Hoyoverse has always been consistent at being unconsistent. Releasing half-baked designed characters with them being super weak and locking them behind many constellations to make them viable. I was so much looking forward for Dehya, but now that she got butchered, I had enough.",1
Just love it ...,5
One of the best openworld game so far for Android.,5
"Still the best mobile game that I ever played, and still counting",5
I love it 🫂 Best game ever ❆ᵕ̈,5
Overall the game is very interesting and I can't wait for next arcons & places (mihoyo thank u),5
Best game I could install,5
Best game ever,5
"Worst impact ever, didn't even feel anything.",1
No content. The RNG on artifacts is just ridiculous. Edit: the game rate is much lower. The company asked play store to remove negative ratings saying it was from bots.,1
Can I Pretty 😍 get my Xbox version please please 😭. I'm forced to play on my laptop and it's barely runs it.,5
time killer,5
"Kinda overated game, but this this is fire 4/5",4
I like it,5
"I love dehya and everything about her, from her design to her fun play style. Genshin just keeps rewarding their fanbase and I couldn't ask more from a Great game.",5
"Not bad, not great either, but not bad. I played since launch up until a year and a half ago, back when it was still good. The game right now is just a grindy artifact mess. If you wanna get anywhere then you're gonna have to devote your life and your life savings to this game. The story personally I could give or take, the first 2 arcs were actually enjoyable, but the rest that followed was kinda meh. I stopped playing roughly after they added Inazuma, the third major region. Horrendous gacha.",3
Dead game,4
Hi the game is sooooo good I wish I had Barbara 🍋😇,5
Fix Dehya,1
Very fun to play with friends best game ever!,5
"W game, try not to get addicted",5
Amazing adventure but is the worst gatcha experience ever created. Fix Dehya,1
Add skip button in dialogue for gods sake!!,3
I havent played it yet but i cant play it bc when i try to login or make an acc and try to play it says error smt and i have been trying to find a tutorial to fix it but none of them work so please fix this problem if u do fix it im sure the game is good,3
Lag,5
"It's laggy in my phone, because of new update",1
"Really doing characters dirty huh? At this rate, next character I like will be scuffed (bad) like crazy because no character is safe from being scuffed now.

I didn't get yaoyao's bday message asia server fix this,1
Terrible optimization on my s23 ultra. This game doesn't support Xbox one usb type c controller on android. I wish they didn't make this game for Android lazy developers that are Apple Shills.,1
The lag is getting unbearable from the server for Indonesia! Please add a server in Singapore rather than in Japan for Asia server. Why have both TW and Asia server in Japan?,1
"i'm a returnee player because i wanna change my device. i was playing on xiaomi redmi note 11 and it works well, but now, using infinix zero 5g 2023, i can't play. it got on the game for like 2-3 minutes and then crashed (black screen). please help me, i miss this game so much. ps: one thing i notice is there's no sound with/without using headphones/earphones/etc. edit: idk how, suddenly it plays well",5

"They recently released a 5 star character, Dehya, and she is weaker than any 4 star alternative you can place instead in her team's. She is riddled with bugs, sig weapon cant full buff her c6 burst despite clearly ment to, and Hoyoverse has not made any statements on the issues being presented to them. They have had more than enough time, if beta players are to believed. I wouldn't spend money, or pull for anyone who isn't Archon/ liyue. It happened to Dehya, it will happen to your favorite too.",1

"It would be great if you could listen to your community and #FixDehya #BuffDehya, the amount of problems with Dehya can't happen in the future, we as player can't allow that to go on. Dehya is a Summonable character and you expect us to just accept that she is worst than character available during lunch? We don't want an overpowered character, we just want to have fun with a new character which is kinda difficult when said character as so many problems.",1

"Kalite gelişimi bakımından çok eksikliği olan zeldavari bir oyun. Müziklerinin, karakterlerinin, hikayesinin çok güzel olmasının yanı sıra çok monotonlaşan bir yapısı var tabi eğer casual oynamıyorsanız 😁 ve tabiki bu kadar yüksek grafikli bir oyunu mobile sürerek hem oyunun potansiyelini zayıflatıyorlar hemde yani... oyunu oynarken karakterleri zor görüyorum , aşşşırı fazlada fps drop oluyor e tabi iyi bir telefonunuz varsa bunlarda pek sorun olmaz 🤧",1
Dehya is unsatisfactory characters. Hope you could improve her or future characters atleast.,1
This game is error my phone is 128gb why is not working to me,1
The release of Sumeru make this game much more enjoyable to play than before. The story/music/quest and exploration are better than the dissappoitment that is Liyue/Inazuma. Bad thing is the release of new character are either mid or bad especially Dehya which is so so so BAD. She shouldn't have been release with how bad she is right now whoever design her kit should have been fired and replaced. I'm seriously disappointed with how they treat her. #FixDehya,1

"In the early years of the game lifespan, they were amazing. They innovate alot, and communicate with their audience and keep in tabs any problem in the community. Now they have become big, they really dont care about their playerbase anymore. As long as they produce waifu for degenarate to play, any balancing, bugs, technical issue, and repetitive characters kit is fine. They really stray away alot from their good early days these latest years",1
Fix Dehya.,1
"The Devs dropped the ball in terms of event stories and especially care put into new characters the last few Updates Especially in 3.5, where the new 5* character is worse then most 4* and is plaqued by bugs over bugs. Even her own constellations don't properly work with her weapon. Or the dedicated 4* buffer, that is worse in his niche then other options. Writing of the 3.5 interlude quest and event quest are also pretty boring overall and at times feel very empty",1
Unfair gacha system.,1
Good,5
I Love it 😍,5
Is good bb👉😔👈,5
I have wanted to play Dehya since her reveal in the 3.0 trailer. To finally get her but not have a comfortable time playing her due to her many issues is incredibly disheartening. It pains me and many other players to see the character that we have waited for so long be so underwhelming.,1

False advertisement. Dehya's kit is so bad its not even a joke. Imagine a new 5 star immediately getting power crept by older 4STAR CHARACTERS.,1
Fix Dehya she is one of the key player in the archon quest she deserves better than this mess,1
:D,5
Fix dehya,1
This games doesn't have emotion and good events. The community are the worse im being honest. The games doesn't even have seasonal event. The story is often skipped by the players since they are bland and emotionless. But in the positive side this game have good designs and graphics but thats it.,1
"The quality of the story in game has declined, and the company became stingier. The weapon banner is a scam, artifact farming is insufferable and the primogem pricing is way too expensive. The anniversary rewards are disappointing, recent balancing of characters is a mess and the Raiden-Beidou interaction should have been clarified before the banner went live. I reccomend the game for its exquisite art, wonderful music and prior story quests... but beware of the game's predatory monetization.",2
lesgooo teyvat,5
"Finally got back into Genshin because of Dehya. Find out Dehya's kit is poorly synergized becuz: Base stats focused towards HP BUT Elemental skill/Burst scaled towards ATK which weakens Dehya's DPS potential, Passive Talents on long cooldowns with short durations resulting in lower self-healing (from Stalwart and True) & Gold-Forged Form State becomes a 9s countdown for True interruption resistance buff (From Unstinting Succor) which weakens Tanking potential for Dehya! #FixDehya",1
"One of the best RPGs out there. I'm a huge fan of the overall story and sceneries as well as the characters in it. Although the graphics are good on max, the NPC's clothes is a bit low quality as well as other small details. It could have better graphics even if it was just on PC. Plus, an option for 120+ fps would be necessary. It's a bit lame to be stuck on 60.",4

"The game is great and I enjoy playing. But when I first had started the game, I accidentally switched the server to europe instead of america. I thought it didn't matter and continued playing but apparently my friends have all picked america. I wasn't able to play with them because i was in a different server/region. An option to swap or transfer data into a different region would be good.. but overall i really like the game and love all the characters you can play as.",4

Hoyoverse made a big mistake... They don't give 20 intertwined fate to a new player. I also can't use a character that i wanted... I thought that was a bug until i can't walk... Idk if this glitch only for me... But this is my feedback. Hope you fix this in 3.7,1

"I both love and hate this game. I'm still playing and enjoying it, but there are so many things that I find frustrating. I love that its casual and requires less time commitment. The combat system is good, and it's periodic events are quite creative. But it's unfriendly to new players for reasons I can't get into cos of char limit. I appreciate that they do not obfuscate the gacha currency like other games but they are also very miserly by comparison. The artifact stat system is too random.",3
Very interesting game but it can add more feature like trade material or buy the material from other player. It can facilitate new players.,4
if you download this game you can't play because you need a lot of space to play.,1

In 3.5 They released a character in a nearly unusable state and when they got feedback through their customers support page addressing just some of her issues all we get is a message pretty much just saying ""we hear you"" with slight variations making It feel like it's all automated.",1

I absolutely love this game Im a open world game lover and this is by far the best mobile game out there. At first I had some slow download issues but found out I had to uninstall the game box app( you might have another game running app) but once I uninstalled it the download speeds dramatically went up. The game has a smooth wonderful layout and gameplay. For those who are having issues with performance try to downgrade your graphics in game and it helps. I have been playing it all day(⁠♡⁠ω⁠♡⁠,5

"Predatory gacha game that wants to make you spend all your money and waste all your time. The developers constantly insult the players' intelligence. They do not want to improve the game and openly admit it. Newer 5* characters are weaker than the initial 4* releases, huge reverse powercreep. Big underground areas with no map. Hundreds of hours of walls of unskippable dialog, autoclicker recommended. Rewards for exploration are horrible. The company seems to hate their own product. Avoid!!!",1

This is probably the worst game I've ever come across. I only downloaded it to write this comment. This game rips off Zelda breath of the wild so hard it's not even funny. Legit I saw a ad of things that where basically koroks. Nothing of this game is original. Like I even rather play minecraft rip offs than this. Negative infinite/10 for me. And how do they have the mind to put ads of this game. GARBAGE!,1
Is impressive 👏 I love the game so much until I can't control myself,5
"White characters always be superior when tan or black will be inferior in gameplay, racist game. #FixDehya",1
"Literally nonexistent ""customer service"" department. My friends and I all play this game together and we spend pretty consistently on welkins, battle passes, and crystals. But one of our group has had a super simple email issue, and has spent MONTHS trying to get it resolved. Every time it's the same automated messages bouncing back. Not being able to play with our friend has made us slowly lose interest and want to quit the game all together and just take our money elsewhere",1

I really like it its justt the bugs with the black screen on mobile is very anoying sometimes i cant even log in and fix it so todays events wont be playable so its kinda sad All the bugs in game really is anoying But you get use to it,5
I have played this game for a 6-7 months now if not a year. After saving primogems for months and months even spending money on the battle pass and the extra daily log in stuff. I can say that this company only cares about money and nothing else. The fact that they are willing to release a new character in Dehya and her kit be this disjointed and bugging it is honestly so disappointing. This company has on multiple times ignored the players and fans and this is the final straw! #FixDehya,1

The games is nice and it has very good graphics and it also shows everything like the trailer and the gacha system is also good but which troubled me the most is that we can't change our server to play with our Friend from another server with out deleting our stuff it would be great if we can change our server with ever character and things we have,4

Please fix this, thank you.",1

Amazing game. Been playing PC and console games for decades and this is my first and only gacha game. And it's great. The gacha gives more value to the characters and you can play and enjoy it for many more years unlike single player games which after you finish you're done then move on to the next game. Nothing wrong with that but sometimes you just want a game like Genshin that can give you that comfort of knowing there's always new things every month. 2 stars for terrible ping,2
They just don't wanna do anything that benefits the player idk it's such a huge game for them to just release a character that does no damage at all just whitewashed a whole nation skins are just a copy paste of the same outfit with a few different details and is so friggin expensive bad optimization it lags so much and waste a lot of GB with boring bosses Daily resins are low there's a lot more to complain even tho the game's atmosphere is nice and it can be fun if they do improve the game,3

This game is the best game I've ever played in my life and the graphics are just best in tha world 🌎,5
"Genshin is one of my reason why I'm still living right now, So I like to thank u for making this game thanks for the beautiful memories I will treasure it..",5
The best game i ever played.,5
The​ creators of​ this​ Game​ often not​ listen​ or​ respect to​ player's feedback,1
AMAZING!!! ITS SUCH A FUN GAME I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!,5
This game cannot join and first time I try this game and it couldn't join game but I already logged in.,1
Very good game,5
Amazing graphics,5
I love it,5
"i like the game but the racism in this makes me feel kinda disappointed :/ why everyone is white even if they're from a nation inspired on egypt??? ""oh but cyno, dehya, kaeya..."" they're not even close to being black and r whitewashed every time they can stfu",1
As a sign to those who raise complain on dehya's kit I rate g.i 1s..cuz we deserve good quality product even it is standard whatsoever..and I'm one of those who beennwaiting for her release..such disappointment cognosphere. We deserve good product with quality..not trash.,1
"Mihoyo my device is oppo a31 and the problem is I can't see grass, kaeya ice bridge, texture glitch in dvalin and la signora , can't see damage no.etc edit: I got new phone with snapdragon 870. And now i play in highest graphics with almost no lag.",5
Best game eveeeerrr,5
Love the story!,5
OP GAME,5
"FIX DEHYA. She feels clunky, her burst is canceled at the worst moments. You can't get frozen bc oops gotta jump and jump cancels burst! She's supposed to be defensive and damage dealer but she can't do either role well. Auto target during her burst makes it impossible to hit/kill certain enemies when she chases the wrong thing. She does less damage than a 4 star healer. FIX DEHYA",1
I didn't have enough storage I had 14 gigabits of storage space left,3
Fix Dehya,2
The game it self is good but the security system is one of the worse... 2 years spending time and grind till so far and yet my account just gone with out Trace than cs is not responding after a month and no email about anything it just gone... Yeah this game just not worth the trouble if they not fix the system.,1
Qiqi rerun when?,5
the worst,1
I want Cyno so bad(⁠｡⁠•́⁠︿⁠•̀⁠｡⁠),5
"I take back my once 5-star review. Dehya needs work, she was long waited and deserves the love she needs. The player base, including me, is very dissapointed. Dori, a 4-star HEALER character has higher multipliers than Dehya, a 5-Star Sub-Dps. Heck, how would I be happy if I got a character that is so weak, it can't kill a hydro slime with its burst? Even the slightest buff just to par her with the other 5stars would be enough, it iwouldn't too hard would it?",1
I just love this game ❤️,5
"Osmanthus wine tastes the same as i remember... But why does this milk tastes extra sweet? Hmm, I should inquire about this to miss Ganyu...",5
Hey please give me some coins and wish star please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🙏,5
"Dissapointed to see the genshin devs release Dehya with the state that shes in and think it's ok. Even after multiple reports from beta testers informing them about her bugs, poor multipliers and issues with her kit, they did not bother to rectify anythibg and instead just throw her to the standard banner to try and justify why she is the way she is. I hope more fans will voice their dissapointment so this not happen to future charcters ""cough"" ""cough"" Natlan ""cough"" ""cough"".",1
"I swear, im starting to get annoyed. This game made me download the new update 8 times already. Please fix this, i just want to play genshin in peace",1
I like this game),5
Super,5
"I play this game, but this game can dissapoint you the hardest depends on who you simp",1
One of the besr free games!!!,5
the graphics is good and the houses is good everything is good but the loading screen long tho,5
Nice,5
Plz put some mount in this game. Then I will give this game 5 stars so plz.,4
The best,5
I like the game very much but but but it has no control customization feature if this game control customisation feature it would give better gaming experience I can not play it very well because of when i swipe screen i touch attack battan again and again and it is very annoying i hate and sometimes there are situations where player fight on hill and the camera angle goes down and I can't see enemy You people should add control customization then I will give you 3 most stars,2
perfect,5
SONOT HALAL MODE,1
"Seriously Muheye or Hoyoverse or whatever, fix Dehya! I was in a neutral side when it comes to her performance in-game, but now I'm starting to think, and feel, that you guys HAVE to fix her immediately. No way we can let this slide as it would make y'all release another ''Dehya'' with only different design in the future.",1
Buff Dehya,1
"Look, it's a good game, but when I logged out and decided to log in my other account, I couldn't log in.",3
"Fix Dehya, she deserves better",1
Best game ever. I love it. This is my 2nd account.,5
I like genshin impact so much but when I play domain it bug and can't play if this fix I gonna give 5 star,4
This game is taking ao much internet inside game. 20000 mb,1
The game has a Error I can't download it.,1
"Gamemya bagus tpi klo main sekarang udah telat. Dapet heronya udah susah susah.gachmnya juga agak sakit bisa ga dapet soalnya. Dan klo kalian tipe orang yg ga suka ngabisin banyak waktu d game mending ga usah main GI, butuh banyak waktu soalnya game ini.",1
"Game is cool but hoyo give traveller some region skins like liyue skin traveller, Inazuma skin traveller and i wanted to see other players main traveller like cool respect and the game is super well done keep it up",4
Great game pls release a 32bit version for mobile because my phone is 32bit and can't download the game and I need to play it on geforce now.,5
"Recently released a conceptually bad, badly designed character in the form of Dehya. Her art, model and design are great but her gameplay is not up to par with units of her rarity.",1
Good charecters good story and overall love the updates,5
"New Character Dehya, you really make her dirty Hoyoverse She has good personalities, good character design, and important position in her lore Are you racist Hoyoverse??💀 When you release Character from Liyue, they all have good kit, good stat skill and gameplay I dont believe you really do this to my fav Character Dehya",1
This has so amazing by the graphics and story.,5
Game rách,1
So trashy booooooo👎👎👎👎 try making the spiral abyss actually possible to beat.,1
This is epic and I am a simp 😀(WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY😭),5
Best graphics game,5
Good game,5
Great game with an enticing story and beautiful graphics. My only criticism is the fact that progression slows ALOT once you hit a certain level and you need to be careful early game not to spend all your resources and wishes.,4
"I think its a awsome game :D But there a problem with klees quest, i hope you can fix that and some other bugs but anyways its really good",4
3 out of 5 cause this is a great game but the new update isn't working I tryed re updating it by pressing cancel because it would go to 100% then stop and not install so I decided to delete it and then re install it and update but still it went to 100 and stopped so please fix this and yes I restarted my phone as well and it also does the same thing on my monitor and its brand new with like a million gigobites. And stuff I don't really know but Ik it has alot of space and fast Internet fix itpls,3
"07/03/2023: My previous review still stays true, except for Kokomi. Now, the problem is Dehya, she doesn't have any situation or team composition that players can put her in, there's always a better choice for that slot. Being a 5 star, this is immensely disappointing.",1
"Fix dehya. She's very weak, even for a tank support, her burst gets canceled by everything which makes it harder to play.",1
"У меня появились отчимы, СОВЕТУЮ!!!",5
Best game ever,5
Freakin hot! On one plus 7 pro.. kindly optimize,3
#FIX DEHYA,1
"Hello, I would like to complain about scarabs. As a cyno main, and other cyno mains it is very hard to get scarabs, especially when you try to ascend cyno to lvl 70. You need 30 scarabs. So I think you should add a stardust exchange on scarabs it would be appreciated thank you.",1
Buffdehya,1
Love it so far the community been awesome too at least as it reads. It's been very fun.,5
"honestly, i luv this game, AMAZING totally recommend",5
"I like this game very much. But after getting dehya after so much saving, it sucks Just uninstalled it and may never play it again",3
u didn't gib me hu tao c1,1
what if you change dehya's kit?,1
"Please ADD skip cutscene! The Graphics Looks amazing if you set it at maximum, Story is very immersive and interesting, and the gameplay is Ok to play at mobile, but it's at best when played in pc. Add more events and collab.",5
Great game breath of the wild vibes,5

NC game,5
the game is good but it takes up too much space on mobile devices,3
good game but add invincibility frames in the nect update being frozrn over and over again is kinda annoying,3
among us,4
Please update monstadt it's completely empty and left for as it is,5
Very good build I enjoy it I'm kind of new to talking but it reminds me of a Zelda game from back in the day it's fun well done,5
I've played since launch. I've gotten every 5 star Character and most of the 5 star weapons. There's no end game it just an endless grind. The lackluster anniversary also doesnt help. The anniversary should have been a chance to bring about more interest to play the game for old and new players. Instead it barely feels like its the games anniversary.,3
Its perfect...in every way....ill remove a star cuz imma mobile player and the game requires a high end device so yeah,4
""" Dehya"" From her C6 breaking her signature weapon passive, to jumping cancelling her Burst, to collision with stationary objects unnaturally shortening her Burst duration--she has issues that need to be addressed, above and beyond poor balancing.To address the fiasco about her weapon passive and her C6, I'd rather say her weapon doesn't synergize well with her overall tools. I love her man, but her E. Skill is disappointingly short and takes infuriatingly long that her weapon's passive. Fix it.",1
"The latest character, Dehya, has a lot of issues surrounding her kit, including the weapon. If we assume that her baseline level is C0 with her own 5 star weapon, she has poor performance with low dmg. She gets damage increase at higher constellations, which is expected. But her weapon's passive is not at full potential with all passive buffs on her C6. This is a slap to the face to spending players and punishes them. If there's no response about her own issues, I may have to issue a refund",1
"Alright game, just wish for more skins and also more balance on the character banners as some haven't gotten a rerun in months",5
"I've gotten my account back. Thank you! , anyways I've known this game since 2021 and it never had disappointed me! Its very fun 100% recommended!",5
I love this game. Graphic are top notch,5
Each day it gets worse,1

"It's like One kilobiyte just for this one game and I'm not doing that, I'm sorry but I'm not deleting a whole kilobyte.",1
"its a great game dont get me wrong, but the problem i have with it is it doesn't have controller support and i rarely play comfortably without a controller",3
Reword dehya or I'll leave this at 1 star.,1
Can't even play the game without it saying insufficient space I'm legit crying pls male it less gigabytes,1
"Please add more game optimizations and graphics options specially above 60 fps (90/120 fps) options to the game for both mobile, console and PC please, and seriously! Why the bias to the iOS devices? they actually already have the 120fps option yet in android and PC, it's still locked to 60fps! Especially the PC, why? You know that even the most mid-gaming PC can easily handle Genshin Impact at max settings over 120fps even at 4k resolution right? So like seriously, WHY? and also WDYM Turkish?",1
BUFF DEHYA,1
Love It. I Can't Stop Playing. I Love How The Map Looks To! The Quests Are Also Very Interesting. I Once Played For 4 And A Half Hours Trying To Get The Quests Done. It Is A Very Good Game And I Do Recommend It.,5
"Buff dehya, she was a long wait character you did this? You make this because she's a dark skin?",1
Incredible game,5
It's actually a really good game,5
"stop being racist for at least one second, oh my god",1
Hame crashes on my 5g phone idk why it just runs a bit and then instantly stops It runs on WiFi Edit: chaged to an (older) model of phone and it runs perfectly fine on it no crashes nor any graphic issues I have no clue what the hell happened on the other phone ill add one star but honestly hoyo controller support for Android when? Its been 2 years now mate ya promised,3
I suh berry labs theser gamews,5
I like the game is great so far for me is getting better and challenging that's what I like about it,3
Please add controller support for android users!,5
Very good game play overall. Probably the best game I have ever played. Only a things they could fix. 1. During side quests you can't hear the npcs talk unlike the main quests. 2. The game does not work on Chrome books. 3. It takes a lot of time to get primogems. Perhaps you could add more primos for commissions? Otherwise the game is pretty dang good.,5

Very nice game keep it up 🙂🙂🙂,5
"O jogo é bom o combate é divertido o mundo é incrivel e a trilha sonora é linda,mas tudo nele foi feito pra ser limitante o sistema de resina(limitante de progreso comum em mobile) faz com que a dugeons que antes eram sistema de farm de artefatos virem verdadeiras loterias em busca se um atefato decente so pra rodar mais um loteria pelos sub atributos tornando a unica coisa que você ira fazer todo dia junto com as missoes diarias te fosçando a logar todo dia, além do incrivel presente de um ano",1
"Péssimos, simplesmente estragaram uma das melhores bonecas do jogo por motivos nojentos. A Dehya é linda e maravilhosa, mas fizeram de tudo pra ela ser ruim e o kit não funcionar",1
I think my story quests are stuck please help me...,2
Fix Dehya !,1

fix dehya,1
pls buff dehya,1
Dehya needs some changes. She needs higher multiplier and also instead of 2.5s interval on her e less time,1
Mihoyo has released a five star character that somehow does less damage than a four star unit and is bugged from ground up. She was made intentionally bad and we will not accept this. #fixDehya,1
BUFF DEHYA 😭😭😭😭😭,1
Deixem de ser racistas e consertem a Dehya.,1

why the hell is dehya so goddamn weak,1

This game is really good but there's a bug that every time i use kazuha's burst the hp bar of my enemies disappear please have this fix,4
Dehya needs to be fixed.,1
The new character Dehya is unusable and needs fixing..,1
Dehya is unusable,1
Justice for Dehya!,1
The developers do not listen to the community.,1
It's my favorite game!,5
get better!,1
"why do you hate brown/black characters so much? What happened to Dehya's kit? You ruined her! And also, stop being a coward and give them actually accurate skin tones according to the real life inspirations. How is a character inspired by the Kandakes Of Kush, Nubian warrior queens, whiter than ME, a European???",1
Stunning,4
fix dehya,1
The updates killing my phone,5
Stop whitewashing Dehya and Kaeya.,1
I love it and that's it,5
"Fix electro element, it's too weak compare to others edit: you get 5 * back for a emergency reward today",1
Please fix dehya,1
"This game is a masterpiece! I really recommend it a lot!! The graphics and the sound are amazing and the character design are beautiful as well!!! The quests are really entertaining, and if you pay close attention, you get more in to the story itself! A very good game in my opinion!!",5
No controller support? 1 star,1
I'm Sorry but I'm going to give you guys a 1star for now till you fix Dehya. the level of negligence for this character is far too much! Did you seriously just release a characters with a constellation that wastes her signature Weapon's passive that's a big L for those who are spending thousand of dollars just to max her.,1
STOP BEING A RACIST FOR 1 MINUTE AND FIX DEHYA YOU COWARDS,1
doq adianta ter gráficos ótimos e ser extremamente racista? quanto potencial desperdiçado. BUFF DEHYA.,1
"Open world, Various characters, enemies and challenges to keep people engaged, with new characters and enemies introduced overtime, one can spend anywhere from 1 hr to upwards of a few hours playing due to large map, storylines, etc. Game can become a money pit if you aren't careful. I use S22 Ultra and it runs smooth, with awesome graphics. Would like to see weapon/armor sets included as relying on farming and low drop rates ain't it.",4
Terrible game and racists developers!!!!!,1
No words bro it's just awesome story line and with mind blowing graphics 😍thank you designers,5
racist peasants,1
"When I played in my laptop, it's the best game but when I try to open in my phone, the UID change itself even though I entered the same email as in my laptop. I don't know if my laptop version will get reset or not because of the changes.😭😭😭",2
AlexisMontes958,5
Fix Dehya she deserves better,1
No controller support on Android in 2023 is lazy. You have it on IOS so its clear its just lazyness preventing you to implement it. You even have the dropdown list for control options ingame. Bring this to Android asap.,1
"Best game ,I ever played",5
Good,5
Good game,5
yeah so,5
BEST GAME EVER!!!!!,5
"Story and characters need to improve a lot. Make them more deeper. I can't really attach to any characters emotionally because of their poor writing. Technical aspects of this game is incredible. But as a game which has a lot of lore, the characters must have depth. Most of the characters in the game are childish. The character design is 10/10. Best character design I ever saw. I hope the developers improve the story and characters in future. But make it soon.",3
"It's one of the best games I ever encountered. I love the lore, characters and how flexible the game is. But I do mind that there aren't many black characters and some outfits are pretty sexualized. But other than that everything is amazing",5
"please fix dehya hoyo, she doesnt deserve this #FixDehya",1
"game is good, mihoyo sucks",3
PLZ KEEP THE RYTHM GAME FOREVER PERMENANT BECAUSE ITS VERY FUN❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️I WOULD RATE THE GAME 6 STAR,5
"One of the most sluggish game i've ever played. I played on 3 device (ps4, pc and mobile), yet the game response feel so slow. It doesnt even compare to game like monster hunter or pso2 ngs, which are more demanding and full MMO btw. And it gets worse if you play on Coop. Sure it has good sides, like the graphics, char design etc, but its already fundamentally bad. Its like putting a 10k rim job on a fiat panda tbh",1
#FixDehya. Yall raunchy for that.,1
The game is awesome,5
So much addictive game wish you can make more game like this.,5
"Incredible game with amazing graphism, landscapes and musics. Though the plot isn't the best, it is always a pleasure to play it! The characters are well designed and well written. The only problem I found is the storage for phone users. The game needs more than 10GB which is a lot. I advice playing it on playstation or computer/PC because of this. Otherwise, I highly recommend this game!",5
Why dehya is so weak? #Fixdehya #justicefordehya,1
Loading screen takes a little too long if you downlaoded it for the first time. Can't clean storage cause of the downloading screen..,2
"Fix dehya, omg she so bad to play, her dmg is so bad, her 'support' capabillties also bad, she doesn't excel in anything, eveb if she's c6, alot of people say her dmg is close to a c0 hutao or c0 yoimiya, my tighnari c0 who is on the standar banner as well as dehya have more dmg with similar investment, even qiqi who was the worst 5 star character is still much more better than dehya. Please buff her because her probelm isnt just dmg number, is her whole kit.",1
Good,5
"So after a factory reset, this game runs much better on my phone, I still can't listen to Spotify while playing though. Really need customisable controls, the current configuration isn't how I normally play games and really messes me up. Also, can you make the joystick floated fixed? Currently, I put my finger on the screen, and my character immediately falls off a cliff. Camera keeps changing direction and distance, even though I turned all camera settings off. Add auto run",4
One of the best game ever I played,5
Nice game :)),5
GOOD COOL NICE WOW,5
Op game,5
Good,5
"I had a bad experience in this game especially due to their bad balance and kit design for characters, I waited 6 months for a character (Dehya) and it ended up unplayable because of her bad kit and massively low damage output, and the devs ignore any feedback from the community, as well as the opinion of their players.",1
Aloy still doesn't have constellations. It's been YEARS now. The devs don't care about what the players want and don't even hide their hate for a collab character.,1
Dehya is trash just like this review,1
"Very fun! The tutorials aren't overly pushy, the graphics are amazing and run surprisingly smoothly on a phone, and the characters are absolutely adorable! I love seeing the story develop as I continue exploring. Overall, it's an amazing game!",5
The game is good itself. Devs team lack communication with player base... sadge for future genshin enjoyers,1
"woy sinyal balikin lah ajg, kok diskonek mulu asw sekarang. Ganti server sih gpp tapi jan sampe ngaruhin sinyal player yang dari server itulah njink",1
"I recently tried to reinstall the game to start playing it again, with over 20 GB of space free on my phone when the download size is 311mb, and every time I tried to start the game using my FB account or my gmail it claims I have insufficient storage space. That is ridiculous and impossible when I have more than enough storage space availabile for the game. Please fix this glitch.",1
🗿👍,5
Very good and cool ple lower the size of the game,5
Bad game,1
Stingy game,5
I will play this is so good game and so many places in it...,4
How to fix storage🙂,2
"Dehya's kit is so bad. She is basically unplayable. A lot of other characters do her roles better than her, even 4 stars are better than her. 4 star healer have better normal attack multiplier vs a supposedly strong warrior. She is basically the most expensive 3 star. Fix her kit.",1
I love this game so much!♡,5
Goes hard,5
"The game we all wanted. Genshin Impact, you need to play this game as it is a open world exploration,fights, characters,beauty, etc. The characters look so cool and their voices are awesome. The only improvement is about the battles. It's like to make them more interesting and detailed. Then it will become the Most Favorite And Awesome game.",4
"even though youtube has said this game is fatherless and negative opinions,i still like this game even though it made me feel fatherless but this game is a cool game so i play it",5
Buff Dehya.,1
Very long loading and uses so much gb,3
nahida for life,5
Very good graphics and story . I like it to much 😀,5
One of the best game,5
The game is very good but you would require a real beefy phone to handle the high graphics.,5
"Dehya, a 5-Star Hero , but worst than 4-star hero in terms of damage(Yanfei),utility and support(Thoma). What's her purpose if 4 star is better than her ??? And their constellation are more obtainable than her !! FIX HER IMMEDIATELY",1
Best game for Mobile but it drain fast gpu,5
I love this game,5
I like the story,5
"A lovely game without any negative comments. I love that game so much and I plan to play it for a long time from now. If you are looking for a game to do different things and have patience this is your game. Everyday I do something different. I wish for characters, do story quests, play in domains and everything it's just right!",5
好棒的游戏！！！,5
Lost my dignity and my dad cause of this game.,1
Sucha good game graphics are so good,5
Pls make dehya a 5 star not a 1 star and i will rate 5 star if u make her real 5 star character,1
Good game,5
"Very good,i love this game i have soo much fun,the event the story and the archon quest and all the characters,and the weapon too,although its all very realy good amazing, it's just that,the wishing pity 😭 when can i get a 5 star character mihoyo plss just once i need nahida pls?.......",5
"I love this game but after the release of Dehya, I feel like the game is gonna go downhill with their character design. Still fun, but starting to reconsider putting money into it.",1
Pathetic really pathetic they dont even have a endgame and for worse they dont even treat their fans properly they didnt do a single things fans asked them too plese the fun in this game is not worth your pride,1
When I explore with a character then suddenly the 2nd character switches and the elemental burst appears. It happens after playing for about 30 minutes. It's also giving me very trouble completing abyss. Fix this issue.,3
Boom,5
"Very nice graphics, great storyline /w voice, characters have there own stories, vast world to explore /w plenty of foraging and treasure hunting. The free gacha is good, it helped me before I knew it.",4
"Yeah i love the game its perfect but my phone isn't compatible for it, but i still love the game",4
"The game is great, updates every month and fun events. The artifact sistem is rigged tho, and to get from ar 55+ to the next one is very very hard.",5
genshin pls help me i cant do my archon quest cus i cant craft more than 3 special unmoving essential oil now my archon quest is stuck pls help me,5
This game is so nice,5
Perfect couldn't find words to describe,5
One of the best games I've ever played,5
"Buff dehya , i cant rate you higher till you fix her",1
Used to play this game non-stop for 2 years. I miss it a lot. I really wanna know what happened next in the story but life got really busy. Am looking forward to find time to continue the game. Highly recommend,5
Good,5
I love it,5
Best mobile open world game Fantastic story and beautiful world And a lot of characters every one with a unique personality,5
"20963.71 mb so bs, why why why? Why the storages so insane. Next time make the storages 1000000000000000mb. & It took me 1hrs+++ to wait to download this stupid game. wasted my life waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting & keep waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting to download.",2
Doesn't even let me play when I'm away it kept logging out it says network error I keep installing and uninstalling to connect it to facebook into the game pls fix this this is Hella annoying,3
The game is so racist you can see it in this 3.5 update.,1
Buff dehya,1
It's a good one so far,4
10/10,5
"I love the gameplay the Quality,Graphics and Story! It's fun to play with your family nor friends! I would give this a 10 star over 5 (10/5) I love the way that remind some fairytale and I also I know how feel to separate from Family!! That's it thank you for event and more reward and thank you for hard working admin/dev :3❤️",5
Fix dehya,1
Good but need some real life texture,4
Please buff Dehya Make her kits usable....her signature weapon is made so that je can be a dps But all she can do is damage mitigation/interruption resistance/tank She doesn't even function in any of these roles.,1
This is best world wide open game with stories and power like anime,5
This game is Very bad because every time you finish a story quest it needs a higher Adventure Rank and the only way to get a higher Adventure Rank is to finish a lot of subquests and every time I finish a subquest the next day l need to finish the same subquest that I finished yesterday and it needs 20 GB for the updates,1
The gb is killing my phone,3
"The beginning story was too much boring for me, I only was amazed with the graphics, and i didn't like when paimon talked instead of the main character and i didn't like paimon's voice, and dialogs were too heavy and a lot of cut scenes that were unnecessary, you could make the characters talk while they walk or tell the story while doing sth elese not stopping each time to talk i really hated this.",3
Hmmm for low in device Can't event play this game this suck a lot 😡😡,1
"The grind is way to much and you spend more than you earn. The main character is silent and boring, meaning other npcs make desicions for you. The starting characters are beyond trash, which mens you are forced to get primogems for new characters, and even that is hard to earn without events and when the devs feel like giving them out. The game is also getting way to big for mobile devices and you need a lot of space for it.",2
Buff dehya... Do it hoyoverse. Buff her,1
Hoyo's marketing is so dirty. They need to fix Dehya's problems and buff her. This game has too many bugs already. I did not have a high expectation but holy ...,1
The game is so amazing i like to play this game whole day,5
"This is the type of game I really really like you know it's about adventure, fun, exploring, and more it's just so good tho the game is really laggy for me but it's ok I recommend this game much but... If you have about only 1-80 storage I don't recommend it this game is fine even though I lost 50/50 to hu tao it's fine (not)",4
Good,5
Very good game i like it because youve got so many things to dk that you will never get bored of it except for the players that are at ar 60,5

If you want 5* rating Fix Dehya kit!!,1
Fix Dehya,1
"I rate it a 3 star because,my genshin impact keep exiting,I don't know why.I searched in google why does genshin impact keep exiting in mobile,it says that I have too many background apps,or too much apps that the genshin impact cannot handle,even tho I don't have many apps.Every 5-15 minutes it keep exiting.I wanted to quit playing genshin impact,however I wanted to get the characters and maxed them out.Thats why I'm still playing it even tho I want to quit so bad.I hope genshin impact fix this",3
"We get it, you hate people with dark skin.",1
"Best game ever,",5
Ew stinky,1
"Imma put it to 3 start, pls fix or buff dehya🥺",3
"Hands down best mobile game to play, i only played on mobile for a couple of hours. After that i started playing on my ps5 and i gotta say if u guys arent playing on at least console or pc u guys are missing out on so much. Its much harder to play this on mobile compared to pc or console.",5
Fix dehya she doesn't suit in any team,1

Good game,5
The game is currently having a bug: remains a black screen when opening it; no loading screen nor log in screen is displayed even after I wait for a while.,5
Fix dehya,1
one of my favourite game in the world ❣️ I just love the game and the graphics are so lovely and authentic ✨❤️ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,5
"Dehya sucks :c. she gets interrupted casting her skill, terrible uptime, terrible resistance to inetrruption without the passive that's SO SHORT why make it separate? super slow pyro application, not enough self heal nor damage ""mitigation"", migrating the damage is not the same she just dies off field and the on field character too. insanely expensive burst too with energy problems and to top it all? mediocre damage output I love the character but playing her feels like playing with a handicap",1
Ilove this game,5
Buff dehya.,1
"very good and nice game,cute characters,but u need to lvl up to 16 to play with friends,after that it's perfect.",5
"Hoyoverse please make ms hina gorou skin I will buy it, specially if its a 5 star skin.",5
"Absolutely no problems in the beginning. Loved the game. The art style was great. I stopped playing for a while and updated it many times, but it constantly tells me that there isn't enough data to play the dang game. I've deleted enough, but it still tells me the same dang thing. I'm about to give up. At this point, this game is just taking up a lot of space on my phone.",1
my only reason to live rn ⁉️,5
"It's one of best game i have ever played,but in India it's ping is always above 300+ for me, i have 5g network, can you please fix ping issue.",5
Best open world game available on mobile,5
Kinda cool but there's like something very hard but idc I like it!,5
I love genshin impact but you disappoint If dehya only fix the cooldown and have a heal for the team. I think this is just playable.,1
Mataas gb,5
Horrible,1
Very very boring,1
I love the game but updating is a bit hard but I love this it would be a 9/10,4
"Great graphics, music and voice acting, and fun story.",5
"It's good, but when we have a mission and can't play with friends, it's nonsense",4
"As Advertised, Smooth Gameplay, Literally Ideal",5
"Semua nya sudah sangat bagus tapi masalah jaringan kenapa selalu jelek ya??, tolong dong di perbaiki lagi untuk kenyamanan bermain yang lebih baik",3
So far the experience is good but Bennett won't come home so yeah😔,5
"insufficient storage, my chromebook can't handle it I already deleted apps that takes a lot of storage, but still not enough.",3
I Love these game,5
"Its a great game you should definitely play (the storage space though...), only problem is that the pity system is so wack, and when it comes to primos you basically only get 20 💀. Other than those its 100% a good game that you should definitely check out!",4
¿Los felicito?,3
"Ever since my friend introduce genshin impact to me, I got addicted to it and never got sick playing it, this is worth playing, my new happiness, the playable char is so good, the lores and quests, archon quests and more, everything is perfect!",5
So nice,5
Nice my first five star character,4
"I love the graphics and the world building. And all of the characters look really fantastic, and the combats fun and intuitive but simple. but I still don't buy all of this gacha and weapon banner, and pity mechanic bull***t",4
It's the best game ever!!!,5
:D Bad Artifacts,1
"Amazing, game the characters design their abilities and the world design is 10/10 best open world in mobile in my opinion",5
Nice game,5
Best game,5
"This game was my favorite until a couple weeks ago.Before the Hu Tao and Yelan banners where over, I got Hu Tao, but I couldn't use my character Elemental Skill and Burst. I tried deleting and re-downloaing but nothing worked. I really hope a bug didn't attack the game system.",4
"I didn't even get to play it at all! I tried downloading it and had to uninstall most of my games and now only have three left including this one. Everything was fine singing into my google acc, then i press the start button and it said there was some sort of problem with storage. I deleted a bunch of pictures and screen recordings but still cant play! It very upset.",1
♡♡♡,5
I love this game its so fun and I just started playing a few days ago Althouse I've only got one character so far from wishing which makes me a little disappointed but overall it's a good game,5
Awesome graphic and game play and character,5
Good game,4
Best,5
"The state in which Genshin Impact released Dehya is unacceptable. This highly anticipated 5* character, who played a major role in the main storyline of her region was released nearly unplayable and got tossed into the standard banner. Her abilies are easily weaker than all 5* units in the game, even weaker than most 4* units. Her scaling is low, elemental application is slow, her burst is expensive, weak, clunky and full of bugs. I no longer want to support genshin if this is the final product.",1
"I cannot update this app at all,everytime I try I end up having to update my whole phone at least 8 to 10 times just to update this one app,and get rid of other apps just to update it,it's ridiculous how many times I've had to get rid of other apps just to enjoy this one game for like an hour then not play again for another hour or 2 just for me not to go back on it bc I have to update it again,its so annoying and pointless for this many updates just for a few pixles on a phone,so annoying.",3
It's probably the best since Honkai,5
buff dehya,1
Beautiful,5
"Decent game, but very limited fps, no controller support and slow feeling where combat is more of a spam thing than actual skill. Tower of Fantasy is now my game as it fixes those issues and has a significantly better story without demanding hundreds of dollars to be good",3
I love it its like everything u would want in a game,5
"I feel like this game disservice a lot of players. Dehya was a long awaited character that people have spent money to save up for and in return they disregard her kit and mechanic on release. She is very underwhelming, comparable to a lower 4 star xinyan. But some people still pulled for her since she was loved so much with the genshin community in hopes that they will fix her.",1
-5 stars for for trash gameplay and retards who made it with the least amount of IQ level and or originality. The game lacks and everything and it's just a big payout for Rich trash Play store that usually robs people on everything.,1
I CANT EVEN GET IN THE GAME IT TAKES TO LONG TO GET IN WROST GAME EVER,1
Love!!!!@@,5
Amazing.,5
Buff Dehya and increase the resin cap.,1
"All I wanted to say is, this game is amazing, has good graphics, and is a unique game out of all the others I played before, but I wanted more storage in Serenitea pot because I enjoyed building or customising my realm so I recommend adding more storage inside the Serenitea pot (sorry for my sense of english)",4
VERY AWESOME GAME!!! THE GRAPHICS ARE WONDERFUL!!!!!,5
"Its one of the best games i have played. Breathtaking open world, music, story, constant progress, gliding, co-op with other players :))) On the other side i wish there would be one load screen instead of three loads untill youre rdy to play. Themes! that would make it comfy to play in dark. More variety in minions! Lesser/greater/etc. Gethering auto pickup option or Paimon could do extra help ;D This game makes my favorite! Best of luck DEWs keep up the great job! 🥰🍀🌌 ❤️ so far!",5
Is it too much to ask for controller support? Playing this game on a 12.4 inch screen with touch controls only is very uncomfortable,3
"Unplayable. Game will not download to SD card. If you have less than 20GB free internal memory, don't waste your time.",1
Make dehya better.,1
It's a cool game but you guys need to add the Arabic language so it'll be easier to understand the story and the quests .,4
Always get qiqi,1
❤️😁💓😍🎉🎂,5
Great Game! Just make sure you have plenty of space. 4gb ram will run it but it will get choppy. Make sure you have a star data connection or it will be horrible. Fun and very entertaining.,5
It looks really good. I just wish there were more locomotion options.,4
Nice,4
Fix dehya,1
I love this kind of RPG!!! :),5
Unable to download..... Ughhhhhhh,1
few days ago I pull dehya but when I try to use her EM burst with yelan EM burst it's doesn't work with it but i really enjoy to play this game so i hope Developer's fixed this problem.,5
Trash,1
It's so fun,5
It loads for too long and I can't play,1
Good game. Wish it was single character instead of team.,5
Intentionally giving Dehya bad skill set. Very dissapointing.,1
you ask No comment,5
Game is very good no problems but just 1 problem I noticed it's difficult to download whole genshin impact in mobile cuz mobile gets hot fasts and we need to leave it like open for 3-4 hours even if we get new internet for first time and it's really annoying for me that's why I didn't downloaded it in my phone yet and playing on pc only Edit - sorry for soo much big speech but it's usefull for phone players who wanna play it,4
"If you love anime, this game is the best!",5
Takes so long to load,3
Good game it's amazing for people who are trying to find a good combat and graphic game it's so good i 100% recommend it,5
"It just crashing and crashing again and again after i updated to 3.5.Loading time is long and i was patient enough for it.But then after i updated it to 3.5, i can't even play anymore.It just keep crashing again and again.I can't even do daily comission.I play genshin for more than 2 years by now and i guess this is the time to say goodbye.. and new players, just don't play this game, its not worthit just take example to me.Just a waste of time.",1
Great,5
"Although I think the game is wonderful, the one thing holding the android version specifically back is the lack of controller support, I tend to use an Xbox controller for most games I play and sometimes it's just more comfortable to use a controller in certain situations, otherwise minus that one flaw only found in the android version, in my opinion the game seems to be good still.",4
It made me gay,1
"I love love loveee this game. The graphics are amazing, along with the voicelines, characters, and stories. This is overall the most amazing, high quality mobile game I've played!!",5
"Game good, company is alright they can be super greedy sometimes and can make characters bad for no reason",3
♡♡♡♡♡ the love of my life,5
It's really good,5
Very very nice game 🥰❤️💖😘,5
Best adventure game ever the graphics fight and all,5
Buff dehya buff dehya buff dehya buff dehya,1

Love it,5
I bet I would love this game I really do But 1st Off when I'm trying to Log in it won't let me log in and it keeps saying error with Password And then I finally got passed one and then it took me back to the 1st one,1
This game was good i like adventure game.,3
Amazing game and very nice character s,5
I'm playing the game on my phone it's the xiami note 11 with the Snapdragon 680 4G and it freezes so many times,4
"Good game, Good graphics, the game story is good too.",5
It's a good game but I have to say I don't like how it say I have no spa e but that's the only game I got I resetted my tablet and unstall the game so pls just fix that pls.,4
Nice game,5
Cool game must try,5
"This game is my favourite of all time, This game has epic music, Epic Graphics, Epic story, Epic events, Epic characters, Epic openworld game in mobile THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING I love Genshin and i love it's music, I listen all the time",5
"The story was amazing and grafic is good, but 1 problem was I not understand is SLUMBER mision, I was turn on all 3 trial but is not working, can you tell the problem is?",5
Buff Dehya,1
This game dose not support controller but its good pls fix this ❤️,3
buff dehya or i will spam 1 star and dont give answer for send feedback because i have already send but still no response just give me dehya buff,1
🥰🥰,5
Worst wishing system,1
The best RPG game (in my opinion),5
1 star cos they just got greedy,4
Laptops with Intel (4000) can't launch your game anymore since 3.5 update began.,1
I love it,5
"While this game has produced great content, in the newest patch the new characters released have been extraordinarily bad. Dehya, the new 5 star character has been released with a kit that is worse than most 4 star characters and definitely the worst 5 star character as of writing. By locking out her damage and complete kit behind constellations, Hoyoverse has limited her to people who can spend 1000s of dollars on this game. That for a character who had been amazingly popular. Utterly risible!",1
Amazing,5
"This game use to be really good but it feels like this company is just messing this game up. Releasing bad characters, players are experiencing some glitches and bugs and the company refuses to fix it, cost money to get good characters, has an issue with darker skin charactes, etc . I guess with their new games coming up, Genshin impact is just a cash grab to them now. It's really unfortunate to see a good game crash and burn. I have hope that they will fix it but it's highly unlikely.",1
Game is good but its just the story is taking way to long,3
Tough to use some characters in mob and there aren't any good guides available freely..... Game would be lot better if you have lot of people to play with in-game.,4
Nice game and the story line is great 👍,5
It is sooo coooollll😭😭,5
The game needs toooooooo much space I'd have to delete everything on my phone and it would still say not enough space.,1
A game with a rich world and wide variety of game play modes to enjoy. Thiugh it is gacha you can reach endgame with f2p units with proper investment and the game never feels stingy or like you need to pull for new units to clear content.,5
"Character designs are really good and play style is interesting. Story so far is good, so are the game events.",5
Fix dehya,1
"Absolutely a great game!, But maybe at the start we should get a free character and free primogems?? Like nothing like Lumine and Aether, someone who's atleast a 3/4 star should do, again it's my opinion, I love the game!, The characters are super detailed and the story lines is very fascinating, it's like a fairy in my dream came true and I'm playing it right now, this has been one of my favorite games right now, I'm still trying not to lose a 50/50 lol, anyways ENJOY GENSHIN IMPACT! xoxo — eli",5
Honestly like more and more updates are coming and need alot of space since I'm using it on a phone I don't really have too much space for user that's playing it on the phone :(,3
I love it,5
This game is so awesome you can spend money in it but for the poeple like me that they cant spend money you gotta work hard to get stuff and also cool animation story and also talking cat 😺,5
I love this game but it takes so much storage especially when I'm mobile player,5
"Waiting and watching your action. If no apology is coming, There will be 1 star forever. Respect your players.",5
Best game ever,5
"Buff Dehya, I give you 5th banana",4
"I really love this game, but what they did to Dehya is just wrong. A 5 star character, who is very loved by the community, and which appeared quite a lot in the main story, came out with a messed up kit, incredibly low damage output, and who can't synergize well with many other characters. A lot of us were waiting for her and payed good money for her, but Mihoyo released her like this anyway. Showing complete disregard to the community. Until they fix her, my score will be 1 star.",1
"Really an amazing game. But there are some problems. 1. Make competitive multiplayer content, multiplayer in genshin impact is boring asf. 2. A search bar in the crafting menu and furniture menu is needed. 3. The bow weapon controls are not very smooth, even when I have set the sensitivity to the highest it's not smooth enough.",4
"This is a truly exceptional mobile game, there are many more like it but this one's particularly well made and refined. From visuals and user interface to writing and gameplay, Genshin doesn't spare any expenses and the quality is consistent. I'm still fairly early in the game but as far as I've seen, micro-transactions are never pushed in your face like other free games and progression seems to be fair so far. For those unsure, this is not an mmo but a single player game with optional co-op.",5
The best game I've played so far,5
They took my payment and gave me nothing. When I reached out to customer service they said they had a no refund policy EVEN in cases where they did not deliver. Game is also fairly racist.,1
"It's no longer supported for mobiles, too much lagging, also network always in 400+ ping doesn't matter what network i used,",1
I 😍 this game,5
"Superb game,but the game size is too much",5
💚💚💚💚💚,5
nak mnangis aku download tpi best game nih sy sokong²,5
I MADE SURE I HAVE STORAGE FOR THE UPDATE! I TRIED TO UPDATE THE GAME *10* TIMES! BUT NO IT SAYS COULDN'T UPDATE. Didn't know it was full caps. But yeah idk why I can't update the game edit: i was able to update it,3
"The effort that is put into this game is astronomical. From the music, lore, gameplay, characters, openworld design, even background and side characters have amazing storyslines. You will surely be immersed into the big and wonderful nation of Teyvat.",5
Best game to exist,5
My favourite game this super entertainment,5
Best game for mobile,5
Good game,5
Fix dehya,1
amazing muwah<3 but please more inclusively darker skin color and body types and please don't take so much storage ty!!,5
Genshin. lmpact,5
= ),5
Where are the damage numbers and don't tell me about system requirements when tower of fantasy same game has damage numbers,1
"Even after playing it for 2 yrs.. the devs dont care about fixing about player complained features, like the artifact system and better endgame mode. Its a waste to invest resources into this game.",1
Oh my gosh i love this game so much,5
I thought this was a good game so I downloaded it but the loading screen!! It's so long it's making me frustrated!,2
to many quest I can't do it all,2
I love everything and it's all smooth I'm just missing the controller option on Android. Hope it's gonna be in 3.6,3
Gúm,5
"I love this game so much!! This is the best game in MY LIFEEE!!!💘💘 The graphics are soo beautiful and it make the game more realistic!! Also the gameplay, fighting, lore and places to explore making it fun to play. Thanks miHoYo for making a such wonderful game. Btw...Im so excited for V3.5 and the new character🥰🥰",5
"My account got hacked and email ed H0yoverse now i want to see what response i get ,but the game was so friggin awesome,i hope i can get my account back",3
the best game ❤❤✨🤝🏻,5
Best game for ever,5
3 star because there is no option to skip. Please add it!,3
PLEASE BUFF DEHYA!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Amazing game, good storylines, amazing and beautiful characters. Challenging and amazing areas. I'm just upset that I have it downloaded on my PC laptop and it takes up to much storage space. I cannot play it anymore due to storage. I tried on my mobile though my characters aren't there?",3
The game is best,4
"New char Cyno doesn't have increased resistance to interruption during burst despite having the same description as Raiden Shogun. Should add skip button for most of the boring dialogue in event. 30 minutes cringe and useless dialogue to start windblume event in 3.5, what next?",1
It's good,4
"I am so sad because a scamer took all my primogems. I had over 70,000 primogems. But now only 250",1
Bruh this game is literally take half of my storage 😡😡,1
Best for anime fans,5
Size still a prob. But have active development team,3
"Its a little laggy at the start for me but I now dont lag! Its a very fun game and please fix kaeya and other ice users that can freeze and walk on water please,I cant freeze the water and I am on vivo 21",5
Super game I love this game,5
GODOD,5
"This game is fun !, you should try it ! / game ini seru !, kamu harus mencobanya !",5
Buff Dehya please just don't make her burst cancel when u jump 😭,1
100000/10,5
Best,5
Buff dehya,1
It keeps say network error I will delete genshin pls fix it😭😭😭😭,1
"Tons of talking and unskippable, pointless conversation",1
Buff Dehya,1
"Its a good game , amazing characters and other cool stuff its truly something an anime person would like . The reason i gave 4 stars its because that whenever i didnt play for a few months the game is restarted like when you first download it , so i had to make another account. The second reason is that when you get 260 primogems and wasted it with that bluey thing it only gave me a weapon but i believe everyone has that problem.",4
Pls give me yelan🛐,5
Why tf do in pc version do we have to resintall the whole game again and again whenever an update comes ??????,3
It's very good game but I have a favor please make a game a multiplayers because I'm bored to be alone in this world.,5
Please add controller compatibility.,4
This game is really good but the only problem I see is that we can't restart our game like Too many people need to restart their server and start over but that's like impossible 🥲,4
Gud game but needs pvp (but add same levels like adjust stuff),5
revamp dehya!,1
"Mihoyo, it kept redownloading data, i have been waiting for 10 hours + my wifi is fine ... Pls fix this",5
Increase resin capacity n cooldown.,1
"It is a very nice game and I like how they are making adjustments, but there are some things I would like them to fix, like giving free intertwined fates because sometimes, for free to play players, it is to hard to get a five star character.",4
Buff Dehya. Don't stop her burst after jumping.,1
"The developers are being so Subjective. Of course I know this game was developed by PRC company, but that doesn't mean you can make one of seven region which depicting China have to better than others, I mean just look at Dehya.",1
"This was an amazing game to play! I truly enjoyed the sound effects and the voice actors. But the best part was that it wasn't just a visually nice game experience but a game with a good story and lore. As well with many other things to do besides being kept on one path. I love this game. And I was introduced this game by my friend, and I haven't regretted it since! Oh, and how could I forget the character designs are amazing!!! I recommend this to people who have not played the game yet. 10/10.",5
I'm amazed of this game☺,5
The best game I have ever played. It would be great if The pity would be counted a bit accurately,5
"So I heard a rumor that says Dehya was weaked on purpose because she has masculine female traits and some conservatives deemed her to become a week support to ""male"" characters. I don't want to believe this but the design of Dehya couldn't be more disgraceful to all of her fanbase and Genshin's community. #buff_dehya",1
Chad qiqi >:),5
Awesome,5
One of the best open world game I ever played ! And it's on android so I can play it whenever I want ! The story and the graphics are both perfect! I highly recommend this game to everyone without any age restrictions,5
Keren,5
I want to download version 3.5 in my computer it's already 100 and then there's an error from GI then it restart to 1 then after that I hate GI. I rated 1 star cause I like open world and GI is open world so I rated 1 star.,1
"Crashed after loading screen. Only got it to actually work twice. Works fine on my desktop. I'm on a Nokia G50, when it did work it ran fine. Suffered about 25 crashes in a row trying everything to get this game to work on mobile. Nothing worked. Uninstalled. Genuinely really angry and disappointed.",1
getting lazy now mihoyo? you did dehya so dirty,1
gapernah main tapi rating 5 bitang🙀🙀,5
Good,5
I like this game it is always interesting to play genshin impact but fix like the heros not sus,4
Good game actually,5
I love it,5
i dont like it very much because its said not enough storge but i have 10GB/64GB,4
"Honestly, I love genshin but mobile sucks. It's laggy and just not it. PC is way better, but this is a gacha game so it takes a really long time to do anything.",4
Very nice anime game but the game storage is too much high.,5
"Behold the ""buy a pc to play this"" game",3
BUFF DEHYAAA REWORK DEHYA,1
good chop,5
Size is 20gb in phone after downloading everything,4
Very good,5
Good game,5
"Racist game company.Most if not all dark skinned characters have underwhelming kits.Even 5 stars units.A good game but there's a very strong bias towards people of colors.The units are just for show, barely usable.Very not recommended game from a scummy racist gaming company.And here i thought you were gonna ""Save the World"".TSK",1
I don't like it so big data storage 🙂,1
That game is great,5
Best game ever,5
"everything is beautiful. the story, music, character design, everything!!",5
Nice game,5
Most definitely a fun and if even have good graphics and you can change them and it tells if the graphics w6be to much or not,5
this game is very best and also the best,5
Ever since the inazuma update I just stopped playing it. The open world mechanics just got confusing due to the limitations of my characters.,1
When I try to play it won't let me at all,1
We need more endgame combat content,4
I like open world games and games that take some time to beat.the dialogue is a little bit long but graphics n detail is awesome.,5
I cannot login my account in genshin it always stuck in checking update. Please let resolve this problem or bug.,3
Rework dehya. She is by far one of the worst character in term of gameplay. Her design is top tier and her beign a 5* she should not be out dps by 4* while also having worst utilities than 4*.,1
It won't let me play on my tablet I Wish I can play ON MY TABLET IT WONT LET MEE so please make a Genshin impact game that u can play on tablets because for me I can't play on my tablet so please MAKE A GAME U CAN PLAY ON TABLET,4
🤔 I don't know why dehya as a five star character doesn't do much damage i don't know why i have thoma as a tank and candace and they are better specially thoma in my experience i thought dehya as a five star would deal explosive damage or hyper buff I'm kinda of disappointed though im really enjoying the event i guess i try to work dehya out for a while,4
"This is the type of game that Android's needed for a long time, breathtaking vistas addictive gameplay real-time absolutely stunning a true masterpiece",5
So cool,5
It's a good time playing this game. And also story line and the lore are so good even characters are good the design . Not gonna lie this is the best game for me,5
I love Anime. I love the legendary of anime. Anime is more than cutest among other cartoons 😻😻 But This game is amazing i liked it Because it has cool garphos cool 😎 adventure and much more fun 😊😊☺️😊 I liked and Loved so much when the game is released 😍,5
Definitely a good game I love the graphics the characters but it's hard for me to level up and I can't finish the other quest they give but overall very fun game....,4
What did Dehya do to deserve this?,1
The storage percentage is very high,3
अवॉसम game,5
NO DETAILS I LOVE IT!,5
"I love this game! It's really addicting, I play this game every day! But the thing is I don't get a free 50 rolls 🥲",5
"Fix dehya, we dont need another xinyan in the game. 💀",1
"This is game is so satisfying and calming too! I really like the asthetic you went for, amazing.",5
Can u guys reply uwu,5
You had no reason to ruin Dehya like that💀💀💀,1
Best game,5
The game looked interesting so I downloaded the app and it said insufficient storage so I deleted a few things and it still says the same thing.,3
Honestly all my friends say this game is fun but it says error code 9907 download not working every time I tried (I am still trying TuT) So my rating is it seems like a good game,3
BUFF DEHYA!,1
Excellent,5
"Give dehya a better kit please...Why would you give her such a nice design just to give her a barely functioning kit? Also, if you're going to play Genshin on mobile, I suggest getting a new device because this game feels terrible to play on low quality.",1
I will change to a 5 star once you make android controller friendly for mobile phones not everyone has a freaking IOS 😑 😒 🙄 😐 😤 fix this it's 2023 i loved this game but my hands hurt and now I can't play this game cause you won't allow androids to use controllers you guys are horrible.,1
Make the sumeru playable characters tanner its hot and sunny asf in the desert dawg,1
Loving it so far :] <3,5
How to solve heating issue when they st downloding additional pack in Qualcomm snapdragon 870!,3

Love it that u can switch in between characters quickly.,5
Itsssss AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG GET ÎT ÑÖW BUT THËRÉ Ïẞ Ã ÇATÇH ÎTẞ WÃY TØ ÃDÆÇTÏÑG HÈLP MY WÃLÊT PLẞẞẞẞẞẞẞẞẞẞẞ,5
Nice game,5
I can't paly it error 9907,1
Hh,2
After dehya realised I like her but her dmg is so low and when I use her burst and jump it gets cancelled and if I freaze or got trap on a Buble she jump I hate it and her locking I can even tagwr azsdaha tail it's so hard to use her and if I Sprint she jump please fix it,1
It took so long to download the resources but hey its a fun game with amazingly written story and lore. Very complex it's great!,5
311 mb no it is more than 13 gb memory,1
Gooood geam,5
keren,5
Yeah.Really good game in the beginning it needs 25 gigiabits but it's fine Because this game is too good I mean how this game is free when this game is this good it have literally everything I am playing this game form 5 days and I am not bored it's deserves 5 star to be honest only 1 problem which is storage no lag at all My phone is not so good but the game is working smoothly which is good this game is so good specially wind glider is my personal favourite best game I have played till now....,5
The game is good the updates are like a Day long 😐,3
Đã nói nhiều còn éo cho skip,1
"Gacha and artifacts system took the 5th star away. Everything else makes this a 10/10 experience for me. Amazing lore/plot and characters, with lots of extra texts if u're into it, beautiful voice acting in kr, eng, ch and jap even tho sometimes listening to paimon can get annoying. Fomo makes it hard to take a break but it's inevitable to get burnout once in a while, and after 2+ years i've learned to shut up my completionist side :') overall i love it and wouldn't change many things if i could",4
"So far, I just love the game and the details.",5
Inside the game there is 18 GB but it's good,3
Buff Dehya and you will get 5* back!!!,1
Excellent game. Totally recommend it,5
Best game ever i played,5
No sd card option can't even download the in game content to run the game.,1
"Easily the best game ever on mobile. It's amazing what Hoyoverse has managed to pull off here! From visuals, gameplay, lore and music, Hoyoverse hits the mark in every aspect. I cannot emphasize enough how well made a game this is. Absolutely stoked about how we still have years worth of content still on the way!",5
"Can you please make the teapot limit even bigger so i can put all of my decoration that I wanted, some of the players are complaining about this",5
The best in the business,5
"Best game ever, i've been 3 years play thia game",5
Bro I'm trying to watch YouTube POW genshin impact ad like bro the game is only made for simps,1
OVE ITT!!,5
It is an AMAZING game I would totally recommend it to adventurers 😁,5
I like this game but it takes so long to get anywhere. Please add a skip button for the dialog.,3
"This game was super fun. I enjoyed every day grinding it but seeing my most awaited and fav character Dehya with energy issues, 0 synergy with Yelan and Xingqiu, burst jump cancel, low damage, short burst duration. Please the whole community is waiting for those little things to get fixed. Its not that hard. 😭",1
"It's a good game, it's very interesting if I'm being honest there's a lot of things to see and the way it's made is very beautiful I love this game but one thing is loading the game takes so long and it's kinda annoying bc you have to wait for so long but overall it's a really good game love it.",4
Mwa,5
Please finally support android remote control!,4
nooo i want download this game why the game say got it :(,1
Nice game,5
"Nice game to play once for story and delete from your device. Developers run out of ideas for new characters in game. In 6 months they created maybe 2 characters with interesting design. At the time of writing this review the newest 5* character released is Dehya and she is a disaster. Finally someone with fun kit to play, but her damage numbers are so bad she is worse than 4* character from 2020 (Xinyan). And both of them are so weak there is no reason to ever use them.",2
"Been playing for 2 years, but the storage it takes is crazy.",4
its good,5
This is the best RPG I have ever played!!!,5
Dehya is a trash unit and should not have been sold.,1
Dehya bad Fix Mihoyo,1
Very very cool game,5
"I'm seeing that I have to download 21gn worth of file in the game, please @ the developers, is this an error???",3
Increased my rating to 4 stars since much improvement has been made over the past year in terms of player rewards and fun factor. Good job!,4
I would rate it a 1 star because it sucks the controls and you cannot pvp L GAME,1
various mechanics and in game systems need improvements but otherwise this game is great,4
So beautiful game,5
Its one of my favorite games! I play daily and i love the new updates and characters too! Its also very calming and the sounds are just amazing! And all the characters sound and game have really high standards too! 10 out of 10 Definitely recommend,5
"The game bugs alot when I try to play, and bugs out, I hate that because I'm still stuck on the archon quest, and when I wanna fight a boss in a new place, it goes 1-5 fps every minute. Love the game, now don't get me wrong. The game is amazing In every way, but it's to difficult to get the character you want. You either need to save up, which takes days of doing quests and exploring. And when you do have enough, you either lose or have to wait untill the next time the character is back.",3
fix dehya kit,1
Well I was going to try it but it's over 20gb,1
Won't let me purchase all because I have it linked to a PlayStation account so dumb.,2
"Its a good game for newbies but as an end game it has several problems. There is no end game content for testing maximum potential of builds and characters. Also artifact drop rates and resin system is so annoying too.. After doing the story quest once a month you really don't have other things to do, its all boring daily commissions and weekly activities. there is also boring non-combat events too(cooking,taking pics) For a better experience in combat this game truly need an end game content",3
"It simple, revamp Dehya. REVAMP HER OVERALL SKILL AND HER PASSIVE. All that money i spent just to leave me feel frustrated?",1
I love this game,5
Its so good😍,5
I love genshin because everything is cute and beautiful I like more that u can make friends and chat with them tho it takes to much memory if u have it on ur phone,5
First tighnari now dehya,1
This game is the best and to get a 5 star isn't great but I love the adventure and interesting quests,4
YES YES YES EVERYTHING I HAVE BEING LOOKING FOR IN ONE GAME THANKS FOR MAKING THIS GAME,5
Buff Dehya. The way you treated her is unacceptable,1
"Overall, very good graphics and interesting characters. The world is so interactive and the stories are engaging. When the connection goes funny then it is a little annoying but other than that I would recommend this game",5
i think its a amazing app its really fun and goods to play,5
I saw people so I know it's good but it won't let cause I don't have enough storage but I only used 66 of storage,4
This game takes too much storage. I prefer Having apps having less storage,1
Since 3.5 update I can't update thr game anymore I tried everything please tell me how you download,2
Best game,5
"I'm mostly picky with games I like , but this game has everything! Cool characters, amazing storyline and breathtaking scenery, love the details !",5
Good,5
Fr the best 👍💯❤,5
It takes 30 minutes to download in app not worth it,1
my game got started all over again i dont know what happen,4
I can't say anything because this is awesome,5
"I absolutely love this game!!! I have been playing on PS5 and my mobile. There's one issue I currently have, I can't transfer my progress from my PSN to my mobile. I have linked my PSN and used a different email for my hoyo account. But it doesn't work 😢 please help!!!!",5
Still no controller support on Android years after release - do not recommend until it gets added,1
Buff Dehya,1
I honestly love this game so very much it's very fun to me,5
It won't even let me play the game and says I have too little storage like how much GB does this game need😤,1
This game is a copy off breath of the wild and it sucks in the first place,1
"I love this game! Even though it takes up a LOT OF STORAGE, i think it's worth it. It's a lil stressful and made me want to punch the computer when I had to restart a challenge like, 80 seprate times, But all together, its a really fun game and would reccomend it to my age group.",4
when I sign in and press play it keeps saying i need more storage error code 9907,1
"Its a good game and very fun to play, the only complaint I have is the recent 4 stars, they are very trash and unplayable!!! Like dori she is super bad I think she is probably a 2*star 😄",4
I like it but the I DONT HAVE LAYLA OR CANDACE I'm just kidding I love the game and sometimes the rewards,5
"Well hoyoverse messing with obvious things like anivercary and characters, now it's with dehya made the newest char the weakest.",1
"It's cool and fun, works well for a mobile version. My only issue is that it takes so much space so I recently deleted it and won't be getting it back any time soon.",4
Too heavy for my phone. Please make a lighter version so that people with not too powerful phone can enjoy it too. Btw the graphics are great,1
20Gb for mobile? xd 20Gb for ps4- ps5 this make sense but not mobile!!!,1
I've uninstalled like 5 times and every time it says I need to clean my phone storage but I have hundreds of times and still wouldn't download,1
"Controls on android are all around terrible. The fact that this game has been out for years and android is still the only platform without controller support is seriously wrong! This company will even go to the lengths to permanently ban you for using a 3rd party app to add controller support, ridiculous! I would play this game all the time if I could just use a controller with my phone. I phones have it so why can't we? It's a shame since the game is really good on other platforms...",2
The way they rerun banners is ridiculous. They rerun some characters after a few weeks while others take over a god damn year to rerun. Good game but they seem to hate their players. Way too little resin and takes too long to replenish. As a endgame player I have so little to do and it's just sad atp.,1
Good experience,5
Lowering my 4 stars to 1 star. Dehya deserves better.,1
Pretty damn good,5
Amazing,5
Sezy change hd wallpapers for forearm gains in the morning vibes coco peat moss and tongue and tongue and lips and lips are sealed and lips and lips are interested and I am not able to take care of yourself and,5
"How could you?? Elliot was a child pedo who messaged 8 year olds, and that all happened because you hired him and didn't do a background check on him and gave him a platform to message children, and even after this had been out, you put his disgusting voice in the next update??? He has new voice lines and scenes in the new event and that is absolutely sick. Absolutely no consideration or care for the victims on your part which happened because of you.",1
"It doesn't work, I tried everything,deleted apps, and still, did not get past the main screen where it suppost to download the things to play. I don't know what to do",3
I am back to giving you 1 star reviews cause Dehya's kit design is so covered in flaws it shouldn't even be released. Putting her in standard seems like a last minute decision to not fix anything. This inspires zero confidence for future units and spending for characters is no longer worth it.,1
"i love this game so much, but i wish it was easier for people who don't want to spend money on the game. I'm lucky to get an intertwined fate or two every day, and that's when i play for several hours a day. it makes it very hard for me as a f2p to get limited characters. in spite of this, it's still a beautiful game, and i'll keep playing for as long as i can",4
HEY MIHOYOOO (σ๑˃̶̀ꇴ˂̶́) HAPPY BIRTHDAY FOR THIS GAME (*＾3＾)/～♡ THANK YA SO SO MUCH FOR MAKIN THIS GAME FREE (*•̀ᴗ•́*)!! SADLY I CANT RLL GIVE YOU ANYTHIN SOO UHMM HERE UR 5* RATIN (~_~;),5
Idk I just like it,5
"When played moderately in a routine manner, this is the best game for a casual experience",5
Awesome,5
BUFF DEHYA!!,1
This game took 20gb and didn't even start INAM NEVER PLAYING THIS GAME EVER,1
The best!!!,5
"Ok, this is the best anime mobile game I have ever played, its very relaxing, amazing graphics and more. The only problem is that it requires WiFi? It's not an online game, it's very annoying too. So perhaps you can try to remove that? I don't think an single player game needs wifi. Overall I recommend this game alot, I promise you won't regret it. Edit: I found out its an online game so yeh.",4
A pretty good game so far and feels playable,5
Fix Dehya,1
Been waiting for support to email me back regarding psn account deletion and moving my mobile data over.,1
The game itself is great I would rate it 5 stars when these issues get fixed - 1)Amber needs a buff (such a great character design but I can't use her in combact because she is weak 2)just remove Kokomi's passive skill - the flawless strategy it is the only flaw in her kit 3)fix Xinyan kit 4)buff Qiqi just give her some sort of defence debuff 5)fix Sara's kit it's really hard to use her buff in comparision to Benny 6)give some new endgame content artifact farming is not up to mark for end game,5
Ew trash fr,1
A little lag during the home loading screen but the game is still fun!,5
Love it I used it all day,5
I was rated by amazing graphics and gameplay overall I love this and please maintain game size,5
"Good game, but it makes my phone heat up so much I could practically burn myself on it. And I don't even have to play for it to heat up, just trying to download the data in the app almost caused my phone to shut down from overheating. No point if I can only play for 5 minutes. Update: customer service is blaming my phone, which is literally a flagship Samsung phone so I know it's not my specs that's the problem. Removing a star.",1
"They made the newest character, Dehya, unplayable. It appears that they did this on purpose",1
buff dehya,1
Trash game making side characters who can't fight in lore good but the character who are op in lore Making them bad. Buff dehya gay devloper,1
Love the game but I need help getting my account back I stopped playing for about 3 weeks and tried signing in and I guess it didn't recognize my email how do I find my original account,1
Very nice game . . .,5
So i need help the adventure rank won't change to 26 pls look into it,3
"Exploring the Adventure World is such a Wonderful Experience ,Thankyou Hoyoverse",5
"BUFF Dehya please Hoyoverses, one of the worst characters to come out in the games history PERIOD.",1
Fix Dehya,1
It's a very good game but I had used 10 wish things but I lost connection and was logged out and when I went in I didn't have the wish stars and I hadn't got my rewards/ characters,2
I love it so much 😍😍😍😍,5
At least make dehya damage a little more,3
"Buff/Fix Dehya, you have to",1
Best game ever but its definitely not made for mobile you can play it on mobile but there will be a lot A LOT of lag and you have to keep a balance settings,5
I play on PC but I got a Samsung galaxy a8 tablet and attempted to download the game and I get a storage error. I tried all the fixes and no good. Bug fix necessary.,2
"I played it, im on ar 45, and I haven't been active on it for 2 weeks and it restarted me",2
I love this game 10/10 but it won't update,5
"really cool game!! i love the aesthetic and the graphics are beautiful, it's never boring! you always have to do something lol",5
"I hate this, Buff Dehya and we will talk about it",1
The company is incredibly racist. Every dark skin woman absolute bottom tier. It says the game is story based action RPG but the action rpg elements are very scarce. Gear progression is terribly layered with rng and there is pretty much no repeatable content for a live service game,1
I love this game,5
I absolutely love this game but I'm having a problem. I lost my whole account and can't restore it.,4
"Brother, this game's graphics are correct. Brother, this game's graphics are correct.",5
AMAZING OMG I LOVE THIS GAME,5

Great game!!!,5
1. I think this a good game there many thing to do and explore 2.my opinion is that this game would be better if there more activities to do cus one we finish there nothing much to do then get thing skin and weapon 3. U should download this game,5
"I caught my boyfriend cheating on me with a 2d character from genshin impact. He was jerking his meat to Alhaitham and said that her thighs are immaculate. Please help my boyfriend, I don't recognize him anymore 😢😔😞",1
im just starting but every time it said download it keeps telling me i need more storage even i have more the 60g left yet it won't let me download and play the game,1
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game with stunning graphics and engaging gameplay. The open-world environment is full of unique landscapes, creatures, and characters. The combat system allows for a variety of play styles and the story is compelling. It's no wonder this game has become a beloved title in the gaming community.",5
I like it and it's so much fun😊❤️ I love the new character good job,5
"Try playing the game, got it downloaded, made an account. Then the additional downloads, 20 gb no thank you",1
"They really done it right now, the one and only character that i really2 want is done so badly. Fix dehya oy mihotods enough experimenting with shoddy businnes practice lmao",1

MORE DOTTORE CONTENT MAKE DOTTORE PLAYABLE AND ABSOLUTELY CRACKED BUFF DEHYA YOU SUCK AT MAKING HER KIT!!!!!! #JUSTICEFORDEHYA,1
I can't even get a single 4 star character that I want in about 80 wishes on the banner!,1
I'll give a 5 star if you give me baizhu on early pity 😍😍,1
i'll give a five star if hoyoverse will give me baizhu 😍,1
Uninstalled cause you ruined Dehya 😡😡😡,1
I really enjoyed this game,4
it so amazing,5
Very fun and had great graphics,5
It's a beautiful good game I was obsessed with it at first with it's characters but as longer and longer it becomes more distant and distant to you same affect with everyone I logged in after months and all my Genshin friends accounts were untouched but what in really trying to say is mihoyo have empathy for your players and let us update this game I haven't touched this for months and now I'm finally gonna touch it and I can't,4
"Lagged quite a bit, but other than that, it is amazing",4
"For a mobile game, surprisingly bad on phones. Ar57 person here btw. Must wait 20s for coop domains to load on lowest graphic settings with good connection wifi that loads 1440p60 yt no problem. Great artists, great VAs. Story is a bit lackluster until Sumeru then it gets good. Dehya is garbage so the balancing team got the rating dropped.",2
👆,5
"A really good game, good characters, interesting story and a fun combat system. Gacha is not the worst, but will have to rely on pitty 90% of the time.",4
I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE THIS GAME LIKE EVEN IM LAGGING I STILL WON'T UNINSTALL THIS GAME😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🖕🖕🖕,5
Its the best game ive ever played and thank you mihoyo for making it free,5
I'm really thankful for your guys,5
Why cant i downlaod file,1
Super fun,5
I heard about genshin impact but for some reason it says I have a storage error and I deleted almost half of my apps and went to setting and deleted some vids and some random photos if u see this please help I rrly want to play the game it seem so much fun and interesting ☺️!,2
"Played this game since day one, I am amazed how greedy the publisher is, they earn millions by the community and they can't get rid of the resin system (or be more player-friendly), give more primogems, more mora, more exp books.... like seriously, it's like they are starved for money for some reason. The game is fantastic but their greedy business modelis a big smear across this game.",2
This game is super . The anime characters are super .each story is intresting .,5
"All in all are good, love it, i really enjoy it",5
Very wonderful game,5
Tou,5
Love it ❤️,5
A great game,5
nice game i love it,5
I mean it! Nice graphics,5
i really enjoyed playing this game and i hope there will be more rewards and lovely events comingg upp!!,5
The game is really great one of the best I've played. however the when trying to get a character on its limited banner it's very difficult even with the quest and events it takes months to grind for the primo gems needed for it. Also the high need for storage on mobile devices is starting to become a problem a lot of my friends want to play but can't cause of the high need for storage. I'm really hoping that the game is coming to switch since a lot of players perfer/ have it already,4
Fantastic video game I love it,5
🤟🤟🤟,4
"Pretty good game, reminds me of zelda games",5
Good,5
Buff Dehya,1
This game is too good but only for good device😂,4
Game terbagus,5
Good,5
"Pretty great, nice graphics exellent story overall its nice. EDIT: IM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE UPDATE LIKE EVERY UPDATE IS 1.50 TO 2 GB I MIGHT DELETE THIS GAME SOONER OR LATER BECAUSE OF HOW BIG IT COBSUMES MY STORAGE ESPECIALY FOR ME A ANDROID USER",5
Why you gotta do Dehya so dirty,1
Server issue Still not resolved. Can't pass through the name selection menu.,1
Buff dehya and fix her damn kit,1
Very nice can explore the whole world,4
Buff Dehya,1
Its an amazing game and I really reccomend playing it,5
I am simply addicted,4
super nice game,5
"I finally got a phone (s23 Ultra 512/12) that can play this monster on highest with stableish 60fps (it drops rarely to 58 for a fraction of a second) And it's a clear winner among genre and why its dominating mobile gaming space, even after 3 years (or so) after its release. Seriously they nailed every aspect of it. Even the most cliche quests. And simplicity of the combat is what makes it so fun.",5
It's the amazing I literally got my favorite character as my first five star🥰I know I this deleted already but at least I have this game in my PS5,5
Totally awesome👍,5
Hoping to achieve something better,5
Super fun and addicting game. A bit of a grind but it's a gotcha game. AR 59 WL 8 and its been a blast since I downloaded it. See ya in Teyvat.,5
f2p and dolphin friendly,5
Im still heizouless/ update: It's been a year I'm still heizouless,1
I really love the game but if you can help me update my game then this could be a five star game.,4
китайские казино,1
Such a nice game,5
It's a good game it has good lore but the community is so toxic i have no words tbh,4
Awesome 👍,5
Goodgame,5
Fix the tanned Pyro character,1
"Please...just please make Dehya a little better, We've waited for so long for her yet this is what you do her? We're not mad, just disappointed",1
Issit just me or I got all my 5 stars at 80+ pity,5
"Its overall a good game but, the game developers just hate characters with dark skin",1
"No controller support, not friendly to new players, no skip button on events or side stories.",1
"Beautiful, game great graphics there r some nice people in co op when I play only problem is mean people in co op but that's not hoyoversers fault so cant blame them. Edit: 2023 sigh when we gonna get end game , mate... dehya ... i- what the endless grind , genshin impact more like gayshi- infact cries",4
優菈呢,1
Just basic wah,5
The game is excellent but. Whenever i tried sometimes updating the game it won't let me,4
I want to lick raiden shogun's feet,5
Now it's 2 years since i started playing Still feel the same excitement for everything May genshin always be our best But it really needs a more amount of resin because we have more characters to build now,4
Best game for adventure and exploring new world,5
Love it,5
"#JusticeForDehya! Dehya was written expertly, has a beatiful design, and yet has recieved one of the worst kits in the game, despite the designers knowing full well how loved and anticipated she is. She needs either a partial rework, or a buff of somesorts. What's certain, is that she can't remain in this state. People invested money to get her, only to be disappointed in how weak and unusable she is currently.",1
Amazing experience and the view is fab graphics also fabulous I love this game,5
very very very good 🕶✨,5
"I love this game, I've been playing for a year and a half and it became a part of my routine. Only problem I have with it is how hard it is to obtain characters without paying money. Not to mention all the farming required to level up a character and how hard it is to get good artifacts...I lost motivation at some point because of that",4
It has large map and graphics are beautiful.,5
I can't download resources properly and now your telling me that i have waited for almost 30 minutes just for my screen to load?????and your still going to give me fricking resources????this is unfair tbh,1
"Dehya is absolutely HORRIBLE. She doesn't work with Yelan or Xinqui, her burst lasts like 4 seconds which ends as soon as you jump (includes getting frozen and trapped my a hydro bubble) and the only good thing about her is that she can heal herself and HP share. It’s so backwards to me, shouldn’t we want our favorite characters to feel useful and strong? Deyha deserved more than the half baked kit she got! Buff her!",1
"I really really love this game, I've been playing for a year and I'm still in to it. The downside of this game is the pity system, like you have to wait couple of months just to get your favorite characters and on top of that there's a chance to lose 50/50 and reset the pity. The artifacts system also is just so bad that even farming for a month still not enough to build your characters to a point where they can deal enough damage.",4
i really love this genshin impact game is really cool but i am just sad cuase i miss all the events and all the storys and all the new stuff☹️🥲,3
"I have been playing this game for a long time. What has kept me playing is the grind as I enjoy grinding but i will admit it feels like chores now. All the dialog is terrible. The best part is the characters. Gameplay is repetitive and eventually the characters which is the most entertaining part of this game, will become boring. I did enjoy the exploration to a degree. Cant say this suggestion will make the entire game better but this game desprately needs a skip all dialog button. Events borin",1
I really like the story and the characters,5
It s good very very good,5
I can't even play cause of how long the loading is,3
I like genshin empact even without plyaing it Just yet its becouse from my first ever installing It it consum almost two go seafrt 99 in an hour And when it finaly ended download all resorce It says your storage to low or not enough Storage so its really a pity,1
henti version is nice,5
Its a good game very good,5
"For your own sanity do not play this game. Non existant endgame content, garbage artifact system, lackluster events, no new battle pass and yet ppl still manage to defend this game. After this Dehya fiasco there is no reason for me to buy anything anymore.",1
Please give me KAVEH IN NEXT UPDATE I BEG!!😍🥱💕,5
"Best rpg i have played on mobile. No auto quest, Definitely free to play, Graphics looks nice and refreshing and the story is enjoyable.Has english language.",5
"- the gacha may or may not kill me - the grinding "" - Yelan is the only thing keeping me alive - Bring back wibdtrace - Wanderer come home",5
the best game ever✨,5
"I LOVE this game its so addicting, but my parents won't let me play bc they say it's too distracting",5
op,5
burik,5
Good game,5
buff dehya,1
Not gonna change this until you fix Dehya.,1
I would say 5 start game but the game has a few bugs and I think the Signora fight for new players,4
All the characters I have are hot 😂,5
"The game is nice i highly recommend the only thing I don't like about it is sumeru being very laggy for my device but when I go to monstadt, liyue, and inazuma my device runs smoothly and doesn't frame drop all the time.",4
It's a good game. Its just that its file size is so big.,4
"Good game, toxic fandom 💀👍",5
how much gb will it take??,1
Stress reliever haha,5
:b,5
Good game,5
"The treatment of the new character Dehya is so bad. At this point it feels racially motivated to make her kit THIS BAD, she cannot jump during her burst because it cancels the burst, so if you get frozen good luck still having your burst because you need to jump to get out, during Azhdaha's boss fight, when he's underground, Dehya cannot target his tail because of what??? Honestly super disappointing to see her, a good character(story wise), be this unplayable and ruined. Do better Hoyoverse.",1
This game is great but my gaming experience is not good because it always crashing when i start doing an story quest or archon quest do you have any solution or suggestions to prevent the crashing...,5
"I've been playing from the very beginning, it's one of the best games that has ever come out in recent years!",5
its v fancy,5
This game is literally perfect,5
Great game,5
Very good game it lag for my phone few times but it's the greatest game I hope everyone likes it,5
BUFF DEHYA,1
Optional offline like you can only offline like 7days? And after that you have to online when you want to pull for banner,5
good,5
Buff dehya,1
This game is so bestt🙌,5
i just like the game. literally why im still alive (lmao) 5 out of 5 stars,5
"HOYOVERSE please fix a bug, everytime i use my 5 star characters burst the enemies hp will disappear and ive been struggling with it since 2.6 YES its a very long time now i thought its just a bug of the even since new characters are arriving, but i was wrong. Please fix this",2
buff Dehya,1
This game is the perfect game that I need,5
how pIay geshin name?,5
Good game but it takes all my WiFi,4
My account keps reseting,2
This game is really amazing and has a very interesting story so that I am really addicted to it and I play it for 8 hours a day,5
I hope Dehya gets buffed soon.,1
"Game Is good graphics are best story line and all other things is awesome, just one thing not good that hes memory this game taking 24.6 GB of my phone and soon enough my phone cant handale this game.",3
"Fix dehya, no seriously, if you can afford to make really good characters, you can can afford to make average characters, dehya's gameplay lacks cohesiveness and she is below average. In the pursuit of uniqueness, she sacrifices synergy with other characters and also rotation smoothness. Please, put your customers in mind when designing, planning or even future planning characters",1
Very fun to play and addictive,5
ZAJEBISTE,5
It graphics is amazing but it so laging,5
My game was opening but no not cause server problem please solve it,5
The game is awesome!,5
I love Lisa *bark bark*,5
So best,5
I love this its so funnn,5
I am trying everything to install the update but it doesn't download please fix this problem,1
"At this point i am going to stop playing, i have been waiting for Dehya since 2.8 and she is the best sumeru character to be honest but with her kit and with your ""don't jump🤓"" on her burst is just ridiculous. Could have done better, Tignari is even better at this point and ANY standard characters since her kit is just broken.",1
I really love this game its has many quests,5
Pls fix artifact rng tq :),5
"One and only, the best open world and story mode game you can find in mobile.",5
please buff dehya,1
Awesome im speechless,5
"I loved this game sm! The scenery is amazing and ever since I took a break, ive had so much stuff to do so, everyday I can log onto this game with something to do! The only thing I don't like is the amount of time it takes to update and that getting enough primogems for a ten pull would take days. Other than that, everything is great!",4
Overall is good,5
I love this game I've been playing since 2.4 it's a fun game and I love playing with my friends on it overall it's a great game!,5
Why would you release dehya in this state? She is the worst 5 star in the game not to mention probably on par or worse than xinyan which is considered one of the worse 4 stars. She really needs some big adjustments. She doesn't bring anything to any team besides maybe melt ganyu and at that point just use thoma or zhongli.,1
This is for the injustice against Dehya.,1
If i wish something it wont give some h eroes,1
Good game but intend of Genshin It should be getshit at this point💀,3
"I am having a problem thats y i changed my review , i have baal (i paid a lot to get that) and all i can see is that its ultimate 1st shot is not registering due to my high ping , unfortunately as you do not support cross server i cannot change it to my best region 🙂 now fix it for me please i paid a lot for this character and i am not getting any satisfaction anymore (this was not an issue due to previous update) kindly fix it ✌️",1
I ENJOY THE GAME ITS GOOD ALOT OF THINGS CAN BE LEARN BUT SOMETHING BOTHER ME THERE IS NO DAMAGE TEXT GRASS AND ICE ON WATER PLS FIX THIS AND MY DEVICE IS SAMSUNG A12,5
Dehya needs a buff,1
Buff dehya,1
"I like the current version but Dehya is the only bad here, her kit is so bad and so many problems about her.",5
"Yeah no, buff dehya",1
Game really good but this not for low device's,5
"No good Rewards(not enough primogems), No Increase in resin cap, No extra game mode like spiral abyss, They just think about milking players of their money to make them lose 50/50 in character banner. The most greedy company I've ever seen.",1
This game is so good!,5
Stop showing me your ads! I've blocked them so many times but they keeo cominf back! I DONT WANT TO PLAY THIS STUPID GAME,1
Deyha sucks,1
"Pls make that when you switch servers, our progress dosent save on a single server",5
Amazing graphics Best rpg,5
Very nice game. But it takes 30 min to enter the game also i was stuck at 70.48%,4
The best mobile game in all respects✨❤️,5
I LOVE THIS GAME!!! MIHOYO PLEASE KEEP ON IMPROVING AND REMEMBER THERES STILL PLAYERS THAT LOVE YOU AND LOVE THE ANNIVERSARY GIFT,5

Good,5
Very nice game,5
This game so good,5
"Very deffinetly a copy of The Legend Of Zelda, Breath Of The Wild, but very good. Takes up a lot of space and is a nightmare to install/update.",4
🕯🕯 HU TAO🕯🕯,5
"Cool that they released their first ""3 star"" character (Dehya), less cool that she cost me months of primogems and the game UI keeps trying to tell me she's actually 5 stars. No 5 star character could ever be this bad!",1
VERY VERY GOOD ☺️,5
Mantap,5
"I used to play it everyday, then with an update...no more space to play. Guess genshins no more suitable for mobile 😭😭😭😭",2
Please fix dehya's ult,1
Dehya is barely playable with her poor accuracy & CC,1
Mid,5
Game itself is amazing but lacks end game content which genshin team is stupid for refusing to add cause think of the casuals mentality honestly compared to honkai impact team it really shows how they dont care about genshin impact overall its alright game which is held back by stubborn developers refusing to develop end game content and yes i have way over 2000 hours into game on pc,3
I downloaded this game 1 year aho and love that,5
"Recently, I played Genshin Impact again and noticed some improvements on the game play and events. The map getting larger and theres variety exciting bosses to fight. The events were also fun and fascinating to play now. Thank you COGNOSPHERE for this improvements. But, there's one thing that I still can't approve. It is about how long the loading screen load, and sometimes i got logged out by my own. Also, the game shut down by itself sometimes it sucks. Hope u can fix that..:)",4
It's just cool,5
I have enough storage bc nothing is on my phone and I have tried so many times FIX IT,1
Hey Devs! Please fix deyha.,1
Fix dehya. why did you make her so bad for no reason,1
"I like the game when it comes to quests, character,graphics,story,etc.its kinda lag on my phone but its okay to me. But I always remember that this is the best game that I've ever seen🥳",5
Best,5
I love the game but it takes so long to load that I'm willing to throw my phone through a wall if it will work,1
Siempre pongo cinco estrellas 😌🖕,5
A good game,5
"Love it. Its easy to understand. I hope the developer make it easy to earn primogems to wish more. Have an issue though, with the welkin purchase sometimes it doesn't reflect on the game realtime I hope this issue will be fix..the provided action on the in-game customer service also not working..thank you",4
I love this i did any quest and archon quest i love the way i did the weekly boss raiden shogun it was hard,5
the best open world game I've played so far,5
Will not change until they fix Dehya.,1
Good game,5
Buff dehya,1
"I'm in love with this game, it has an amazing open-world, complex plot and intresting combat system. That is why I'm so dissapointed in developers reaction to users complains. New character Dehya is painfully uplayable, not only because of bugs (auto-target of ultimate, jump stops the ult and etc), but also because her damage is lower than minimal needed for game. Her kit means that she must be main damage dealer of the team, however, she can't fullfill this duty. This character needs a rework.",1
This games pretty good I like it but the thing is you need A LOT OF STORAGE because this game is pretty big ngl also WHEN WANDERER RERUN????,5
No puedo iniciar sesión con mi cuenta de Google por que tengo un celular con rom china,1
Perfect,5
I would not recommend this game very long download takes forever to download on a slow you need high-tech gear at least major storage the graphics are good but not recommended,2
Paimon is Paimon.,5
"Buff Dehya, she deserves better 💅",5
Mid game. All white chocolate. No chocolate brown chocolate needed. More brown chocolate characters.,1
It is amazing,5
3.6我好想你啊,5
"THIS GAME IS SUPPPPER DUPER COOL. WHO THINKS THIS TAKES SO MUCH OF DATA TO DOWNLOAD DONT WORY IF ONE TIME U WILL JUST DOWNLOAD IT THEN U WILL BECOME MAD FOR THIS GAME. IT CONSISTS ADVENTURES,ACTION AND SUPER COOL GRAPHICS. I ONLY STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME TODAY AND I WAS JUST AMAZED. PLZZ DOWNLOAD IT AND PLAY. DEVELOPER U CREATE AND AMAZING GAME.",5
Buff Dehya,1
Yes mobile isn't the best. But the game itself is fun. Since it gets updated a lot and the story is interesting. Just wish that the characters that are meant to represent different cultures has the correct corresponding skin colour.,4
Can't even play this,1
It is a fun adventure game,5
Storyline is getting boring,1
"Very good game. I want to play more but takes too much of space, so i deleted mine 🥲",5
a skip button would be nice/hj,3
DEHYA SUCKS BROOOO,1
This game is the best,5
This is bad game it,1
Best game I ever had played,5
So much of taking time and MB,1
Billion dollar company and can't even make dehya good smh,1
It's a good game it takes a long time to rank up and level up but its good but I'm having a problem with something I can't seem to update it. When I update it it says it's updated but when I get in the game it's not updated.,4
Best game I've ever played,5
I love the game But can you fix the bug in cup of commons I can't get the cut scene,3
"Been playing for a few months and while I love it, suddenly the movie scenes throughout the quests have no sound at all. Ever since the last update.",1
Best adventure game I've ever seen,5
why my genshen 56% downloaded resource restart after I updated the game in the play store,3
"First of all This game has one of the best lores I've ever seen in a game Other than that my perspective has changed about genshin, now i think that the resin and artifacts rates are pretty good actually. Imagine getting a god like artifact within 5-6 domain runs, the game will become meaningless same with resin, unlimited resin will lead to burnout. So i think it's pretty good and they do bring events frequently.",5
It said I didn't have enough storage to play,1
"Their recent release of dehya Is so disappointing, her kit is trash and has a lot of bugs, the team that worked on dehya kit should burn to death and live in hell for eternity. We need a buff for her, even the teams for her are trash. Please god damn buff her",1
WHY WONT IT UPDATE.,1
Buff Dehya,1
"The game is great and has a lot of potential. The world is vast and beautiful, the characters are given every bit of detail they all need, and the events are fun. However, this game lacks permanent replayable content which makes the end game user-experience rather unsatisfactory. If you're looking for a game to play for a bit, Genshin Impact is good. But it isn't a good time investment as of now. Edit: buff dehya.",2
"I don't have Dehya but please buff her. She doesn't deserve those kit at all, so bad, so bad..",1
By far the best game I've played on a mobile phone. People may call it a breath of the wild clone but I feel that's not true sure it has some similarities but the game is it's own thing. It keeps me coming back for more (update follows) the game is still one of the best games you can have on mobile but lack of end game and controller support really drag this game down from it's top spot. You can use a controller on apple why has it not yet been implemented on Android.,4
justice for dehya,1
FIX DEHYA,1
Too good to be true but the five star characters is too much luck i didn't got any in my main acc but when I spin in my brothers acc he got Jean pls give me good luck genshin only one any 5 star,5
It's nice but there's little bugs in the game,5
"I can't even get it to download whatever I need to play. I have 18gb free, I've tried clearing cache, data, Uninstall, reinstall, restart device. Everything. Even went to the support page to see others have the same issue with no real fix. Wanted to be able to play on the go but I guess not. I liked it on the PC we will see how long that lasts :/",1
"I love to play this game on my phone but, I give it 4 stars bc how is it like 8000 MB? And now it's like 12000 MB!!!!(probably more in the future to)That's a lot, ngl But other than that the game is fantastic!",4
"I really like this game , it's so fun and it has amazing graphics, I just love it",5
It's a great and creative game 100%! I don't use co-op much bit its a cool feature!! I like it alot it can just sometimes be slightly laggy so 4 stars <3 it uses allota storage that i don't have :( perhaps change that- ik its a big game but its taking up 3/4s of my storage,4
I love this game it's so much fun I love Venti and Raiden shougun And Hu Tao and so much more everyone should install it,5
I do 1X 2X in won't,5
"The best game but bad security. It never notify you if you change your password from another location. I got hacked and it took me months to retrieve it but I got my account now. I have 2-way verification on my email but it still got hacked, it's all in the past now. I hope the security is more strict. Anyways, the game is really fun and also time consuming especially when you grind for resources. I've been playing since 1st banner of Albedo, and I'm immersed with the great story writing.",4
This a good game just hard to play on mobile,4
"It's a very beautiful game, I like the scenery, the characters and the story! the events are very fun but i do wish for more resin cuz with more characters coming, 160 isn't enough. I also wish if you can make an ""Artifact Preset"" cuz it's quite annoying yo keeping on switching in and out of your Artifacts. I also wish for characters like dehya and klee to be buffed, other than those minor issues, its a pretty and fun game :)",4
THIS GAME IS AWESOME 👌,5
Good game,5
DEHYA,1
I. FRICKEN. LOVE. THIS. GAME!,5
"It's a yes, I don't have any problem even though my phone has 4gb left It's a whole dmnnn good game, and I love barsibato and thank you for creating him.",5
For Dehya,1
Ruined dehyas kit,1
"I can't even play it it keeps saying that I have no room on my phone when I deleted loads of apps to try and get it to work, I followed the instructions but it still didn't loads. I even tried it on my iPad which is android too but it won't even let me download on there either.",2
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬💔💔💔🤬❤️‍🩹💔🤬😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤💔💔🤬❤️‍🩹,1
I think this app is awsome!,5
Auto buy character dehya,5
"This game is absolutely amazing, but I would love if we could get a skip button to dialogue scenes, also if we could get resin boosted to 200, no complaints love the game, though some 5 stars need to be buffed.",5
After the Dehya fiasco I don't trust Hoyoverse to design new characters. And the new Windblume event is so bland that I'm falling asleep behind my keyboard playing this game. I'm sorry what the heck is going on here?,1
Explosive,5
Fun open world team building rpg you can play with friends.,5
buff dehya she's worse than a 4 star,1
Love it,5
it is a good game but it takes to much storage.,4
It's an amazing game ... I can not put it down also cross-platform,5
"Literally I have been waiting so long to play Dehya, I saved for everything but to have her kit be so incredibly bad is just disappointing. I love her so much but why did Hoyoverse have to make such a good character, not to mention a 5 star, so bad.",1
"Backbone One for Apple works with Genshin, but Backbone One for Android does not have compatibility. Will Android get this mobile controller support?",4
not lucky domain,1
Good so far,4
it was good until it turned racist,2
I can't describe the game,5
"The Game Is Personally Amazing, The Graphics, Story, adventure, characters and entertainment i really couldn't delete this game its to good even if its confusing some times i love it thank you hoyoverse!",3
Good,3
I play genshin mostly on ps4. This amazing game. Love it,5
racist. why give the melanin characters the worst kits ever? especially dehya like can't jump during her burst bc it ends it? or not even being able to lock onto enemies eg azdaha not to mention how trash her kit and dmg is FIX. IT. hoping everyone comes back and gives the gave 1 stars again bringing your guys rating down. truly disgusting.,1
I can't even play the game I have plenty of space to play it and it says I don't,1
I love the game,5
"I am so done with this game, everyone keeps getting double 5* in 10 pulls and its my 5-6 , 5* and same as always its too at 80+ already on 76 pulls, keeping that 80+ lol i regret bying all those welkins and bp, now i dont even log into this game, f2p friends of mine have more 5* than me a mid spender i guess i will ket those 70 days still on welkins rot away lol. """"""""Hoyoverse Hates Me""""""""""""""",1
PLEASE BUFF DEHYA!!,1
"I love ur game but since 3.5 many people had problem to launch the game so we can't play , I would be very happy if u fix this I need to wish🤞",4
کس ننه آخوند که دوروزه نمیتونم آپدیتش کنم,5
Really nice! Made new friends and I'm now on AR 23! Really good!!,5
"In order to get currency to get characters, you have to log in and do stuff every day or you lose out. I hate when games put you at a disadvantage if you don't log in and play every single day. It really should be weekly activities, not daily. Also so much of the game is move your character 5 feet and then spend 10 minutes in an unskipable cut scene. Most of the story interactions are boring and repeat the same thing over and over and there is no way to skip the cutscenes, you just have watch it",1
Nice game but for some reason they make black charecters the weakest. Racist game.,1
"Top notch artistic direction and music but hellish RNG for artifacts, leveling up characters is unreasonably time consuming. The worst is the greedy move to lock 4* character usefulness behind constellations, as Faruzan has exemplified and recently 5* too with Dehya, very calculated move that was the last drop in their gacha predatory tactics to increase unreasonable spending.",1
"I really enjoy playing this game the scenery, the characters all of it is astonishing but the new 5 star Dehya was slighty disappointing.",5
fix dehya please. she literally has no purpose other than to be a teapot furnishing.,2
Fatherless 🤨🤨🤨?¿,5
"This is the BEST mobile game i have ever played, to be honest the game is very intriguing but if you are a new player this game does NOT accept new player fate (for example you entered in 3.4), to level up certain characters you need to unlock some domains and inazuma too(you need ar30 to get inazuma)this is the only negative comment, but overall the quality is gorgeous and the voices sound awfully beautiful and quests are very interesting and complex, but you need MASSIVE amount of storage.",5
fix dehya,1
Boring after ar 56,3
The besttt!!! THE PLOT?!?! THE GRAPHICS?!?! THE CHARACTER CONCEPT?!?! CHARACTER DESIGNSS?!?! AMAZING BACKGROUND IDEAS AND COUNTRIES AND AAAAAAHHHH I Love it so muchhh<3333,5
Buff Dehya.,1
"Buff Dehya, or rework her kit, her abilities seem very underwhelming. Also the game needs more character diversity.",1
This Rocks,5
This game is actually pretty fun. Idk wut else to say.,5
They don't care at all about what their community says and will purposely ruin their game for no reason at all. They think they know everything and won't take any feedback from players. Awful rng artifacf grind system too.,1
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,5
Lk,5
This is the coolest interactive game play I've ever used!,5
"Should I will give it 5star, bcz, 1)game has great graphics(F high graphics cuz it work on most of phones, due requirments highest specs only), or bcz 2)Game story is great(F the story, the main character is not really main character, they only put nonsense stories of limited banner character with no main story progress for many updates),or bcz 3)Game mechanics are great (F the mechanics, quest triggers automatically when in near area and can't be skip),devs are ignoring this game for other ones",1
NO OFFICIAL CONTROLLER SUPPORT ON ANDROID. ON SCREEN BUTTONS ARE LAME LET US USE A CONTROLLER!,1
This is the best game I have ever played. I mean everything in this is just mind blowing. Genshin is a master piece 🤍🔥,5
Buff dehya,1
this game sounds fun and all but the problem is the load takes to long I waited two days and it still didn't load instead it loaded all the way back to 0% and was really sad I just wanna play the game...,2
Genshin impact is a good game the characters are so handsome and pretty the lore is so good 🤩 but sadly i cant get it on my phone bc i dont have space for it so i need to wait till i get home 🤞,5
"ok like make her useful atleast, playable for the love of the god please",3
The game is really fun. The story is compelling and it keeps me coming back. The designs are unique. I would have givien it five stars if it wasn't for the fact I can't play it anymore. After an update about a year ago it would crash frequently but I dealt with it because I love the game. But after the a update adding a character fairly recently. I can't even get past the first loading screen after logging without it crashing. I love this game! Please fix it! ^^,3
gooood,5
Normal,4
"I love game,But you killed a character for kamisato Ayaka,You totally ruined Dehya,I think you're such a racist. And this is my honest review ಠ︵ಠ...",1
Awesome game..Everything about this is game is just perfect..It is F2P friendly as well.. Playing this game for a year now..I still enjoy this game..,5
"Good game. Android port could use controller support. I know not everyone has/uses one, but i feel that option should be available",3
buff dehya,1
Good,5
Buff Dehya,1
Good👍👍,5
I love the game but i hate how much storage it takes but it's still a great game,4
No words can express how much I love this game. All of the content about the game is just so beautiful and very interesting.🤍,5
I love to explore,5
WE NEED MORE RESIN! RESIN! RESIN!🗿🔫,5
"THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! genshin impact is sooo fun. the more i play this, the better it gets. 100% recomend",5
"Everything about this game is so beautiful, the art and music especially. I love how the devs incorporate real cultures into Genshin's world. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.",5
Niiice game,5
I have been playing this game for a half a year now and this game never failed to amaze me everytime. Especially the music and the visual of the game.,5
My friend plays it when I downloaded it it was amazing fr,5
Love this game,5
Before I have playing this for about 11 months and this month it's so bad it's laggy the world quest is always loading so I can't move on to the next phase please hoyoverse fix it,1
Genshin impact is a AMAZING GAME! the quality is amazing. The storyline is great. Characters are top notch! Just make sure you have alot of storage! And great wifi :),5
It's a good game but it needs a lot of files and a big download 🙂,5
"Thanks Mihoyo, I got a boyfriend from this game 💍❤ We're planning to stop building our characters and build our future instead.",5
So amazing,5
"this game is amazing because it set a trend that a lot of other companies are following. the graphics are beautiful, characters are engaging and the story is immersive. however it kills interest because it needs a lot of effort and time, which most normal people can't afford to spend on a game. the gacha system is not generous, the game file is huge, and it takes a lot of energy to go through quests and complete domains/spiral abyss to proceed. also the fandom is too toxic",4
Very nice quality,5
Poop gamr,1
This is my favourite game ever,5
"Im playing with the new character Dehya, fighting an enemy near a tree. The enemy pushes me onto the trees root as i use my burst. You've said before to ""simply dont jump"", i never pressed the jump button in that whole battle. So would you mind telling me why its just a simple height difference that cancels her burst? She finished her burst prematurely because i got off the tree root.",2

Very good,5
Honestly I love this game but I have a problem when I get bored I always play this game but when I woke up I was gonna play it then it said that I have to clear my storage up I tried to fix it not once but ten times and it keeps saying it but it's okay since I play it on my mom's phone love it so much so don't worry:),5
The game is good itself but what I hate is the game size. Like can you even put 20 gb on a fricking lil phone? Please please developers release a lite version edit:(I love genshin so much but it dosent works in low end devices like honkai impact 3rd 😕),1
kokomi.,5
Very food.I like this game.,5
Fun game but when you start it takes over an hour to load,4
Amazing,5
"I heard a lot of hype around this game, and it lives up to the hype. I'm probably going to move to PS4 version, but the game is very good and seamless on my phone so far Edit: still on mobile, still great game!",5
The game requires a lot of storage,1
"The balance in this game is getting more and more horrible, already many 4 stars were better than 5 stars unfitting for the rarity but now new 5 star dehya kit is literally worse than even mid 4 stars? What is the reason for this? How can you expect people to spend more for less? The devs are becoming lazy and out of ideas, the only saving grace is if this kit is thought of with some future plans in mind",1
It's was okay before the update but ever since then my game keeps crashing whether it is on my phone and laptop please fix it it always happen to me for some reason,3
Cant open the game in my pc after 3.5update i tried every update i could do to my windows and all nothing works...whats happening devs? Im not going to give any kind of rating until you guys fix that,1
Buff Dehya,1
Nice game,5
Very entertained,5
"Le meilleur jeu auxquel j'ai joué ! Je suis fan de MMORPG et celui là dépasse de loin tout les autres! Les graphismes sont splendide, les personnage incroyables et le scénario parfait! L'histoire est prenante ! La map est vraiment grande et il y a toujours de quoi s'occuper :) Il y aussi tout le temps des événements avantageux meilleur les uns que les autre! En revanche, il prend vraiment beaucoup trop de place... Y jouant sur mobile, je ne peux rien installer d'autre Merci ^^",5
Great game,5
The game is quite lovable I suggest searching up what the games like before playing and save up money also complete your daily quest level up your characters even if the supports and have fun exploring fighting and wishing 😚✨,5
Good,5
"Good game, im waiting for hu tao rerun Update, I lost the 50/50 at 85 pity, thanks mihoyo Update 2rd rerun: Wieder....",5
Laggy,1
my favorite game,5
A fun game but some caracters are sus and i want to do it with them.,5
Buff dehya. There is no excuse to release such a weak character just because she'll be on standard banner,1
"#fixdehya #buffdehya The most recent 5 star character, Dehya, was nerfed to the ground and made terrible on purpose. Do not let this be the standard, it will happen to your next favorite character if you don't speak up.",1
"Pls buff dehya she's worse than 4*s now. Make her a better support, dps pr whatever, but make her useful.",2
Buff Deyha,1
"Yeah this game kinda sucks for F2P. If really want to get a whole 5 star team, pray that they aren't back to back banners. Pray that everyone you want doesn't share or have a banner close to another character you want. Because it takes forever to won 50/50, or even get the primogems for it, and the grinding is draining. Imagine you won the 50/50 on Zhongli at 79 pity. Hurray. But then Hu Taos banner is RIGHR AFTER THAT. And you have to go through the trouble all OVER AGAIN. yeah so I burned out.",4
This game is the best,5
"I really like this game the problem is the gb, but it's okay the lore is really good",5
"Since Ar level 1 to Ar 53 I've never had any issues in playing this game but on Ar54 a main archon quest in Sumeru region named ""The Kabukimono Finale"" does not work it only froze up at the time i entered the domain no matter how long I waited it only stays that way, i hope the developers could have a speedy response to the games error, or tell an advice as to how to restore it. I truly love this game please fix this issue.",5
Today I was wondering how to get primogems then suddenly windblume's breath came I am so happy for primogems,3
please hoyoverse give Dehya justice... I really like this character so for now 1 star,1
The game is pretty good the quests the story are the best only problem im experiencing is its size and lag but overall tha game is wonderful i recomend playing it,4
Amazing,5
"The amount of storage this game takes up is ridiculous, I know that one of the recent updates is meant to help optimize storage but it doesn't work if you don't have enough storage to download the update. It's a good game, although it does get boring if you are up to date on the story. It becomes grindy and not so fun as the gacha system needs work. It takes a lot of time to get the stats you want on artifacts. 6/10 would sorta recommend. Decent game just wait till it's finished.",3
I want xiaooooo pleaseee gimmeeeee,5
bAlaNs,1
Fantastic,5
I couldn't open the game i always play it but it cant open,5
I love this game,5
"5* character design far worse than a 4* character. What else can you say beside milking money? Dehya is unusable in anything in the game, in the first place why even make her playable? If you can read this hoyo, please tell me you're alive and playing the game too 💀",1
I love it!!!!!,5
Good game!,5
This is a greate game but I am giving it only 4 stars cuz recently i was deleted this game mistakely and when I re-installed it my I'd was gone I tried to email genshine but I don't get a reply that's why I am telling my problem here please hoyoverse recover my I'd please,4
Very good,5
حلوه,5
Very addicted i luv this game ;),5
Pulled for a character after waiting for ages. Only for her to be full of issues and completely unplayable. Justice for dehya.,1
Definitely one of the better mobile games out there.,4
"Abyss is 0/100 but the story is 99/100, the 3 5 event is great!",5
bad games,1
"personally, I love it, Tho i did need to make a new acc, Since when u reach ar 45 and above there isnt much to do, Since by that time u may have 100-90% exploration, So mot too much chests, U would've finish most quest, And all u have left are the limited events, That has a time limit of 20(or so) days. Though, The game is enjoyable, But the incredibly high space it takes up is... Questionable. But if u do compare it to the quality of the game itself, Its understandable. the game is overall nice",5
"Auto targeting sucks. I'm aware abt the purpose of auto targeting, but it's getting out of hand really. At least give us the option to turn it off, so instead of wasting my burst only to attack God knows what, my character will attack to the direction they're facing into. And we've got some new bosses but no resin cap raise? At least cut the replenishment time, or reduce resin cost for bosses. Or both. 160 resins aren't enough considering the amt of bosses and domains are there.",3
Good 🎮,5
"I think the story has gotten better now, BUT have you ever consider to rework Dehya? I think you guys really did her dirty",1
Most glitchy game I have ever attempted to play on mobile.. nearly made it in the game with the 3 min freezing and making my phone misbehave.. this game gets 0 stars from me..,1
KABOOM,5
Go find your father.,1
The graphics is so cool!,5
good storyline Pretty good game Graphics topnotch,5
One of the best games I've ever played on mobile. The adventure is great and the story is well thought out. The fighting is fantastic I haven't gotten a single ad and there is barely any lag also the game starts up very quickly even on a road trip. 👍,5
Ok this is epic!,5
"Balance game mechanic are poor. New characters need high investment/gated behind constelition/underwhelmed/bugged skill/disynergize. Old character is WAY better but starting to feel stale gameplay(but why the hell you'd spend for bad character?). Mihoyo ignore complaints about XINYAN & DEHYA! These are the prime examples of hot mess characters released. Story, visual, music are good. This game have many white knights & sheeps to defend Mhy's poor judgement, stingy reward & horrible pr",1
Just play it :),5
What i really appreciate about this game is that it doesnt deceive people by showing false images on play staore and actual gameplay is very different keep it hoyo,5
"FIX DEHYA , UNFUNCTIONAL CHARACTER high dose of Copium",1
Game is great just use a device that's able to run it.,5
"Recently, I have been exploring many bugs whenever i start playing the game. It gets too choppy, and sometimes it just freezes . Even though previous versions ran extremely well, this issue became frequent, and I lost the passion to play the game again.",2
"It is a great game but very laggy. I knew that genshin takes up a rather lot of space but it was shocking when it showed 28GB, all my other apps are usually less than 2GB.",3
"I really love this app, but there are scary bugs during quests, and please add more tanned people. On TikTok people say Genshin Impact is racist, I think. too, but the models in Genshin Impact are very pretty, detailed. I like the high graphics too, but this game takes too much storage. I like this game though! That's all what I will say, I rated this game 4 stars.",4
Gud game,5
Why is this game showing the size is 300mb while it takes 16gb?,1
"Can yall please make a portable crafting table, it long process of leaving the domain to craft condensed resin .",5
Dehya needs adjustment,1
There is a very bad thing I actually logged out for few weeks then I logged in the game started from beginning and I was high adventure rank,1
fix dehya,2
Oky,5
Please make the world more difficult and to top it off give better reward ...it's nt fun when u can finish everything in just 3 month ...it's a very addictive game until u achive everything thing that is main in genshin make the exploration more difficult by adding more dangerous or stronger enemy in every region,4
I love this game,5
It is possible for you guys are doing good thank God for you guys are playing ▶️,5
My favourite game is.... Genshin impact!!,5
I like it but I have 22.08 GB but I can't download the assets or play because it keeps telling me that I don't have enough space in my storage,4
This game is like my fav game and a lot people cosplay genshin at tiktok,5
"Low rewards, too demanding.",2
Eaw😡🤮🤮🤮,1
"Honestly, this IS my favorite game. But I rate it a four out of five because of the WiFi difficulties. It's just unbearable. I'm trying to download the 3.5 update and for some reason it wouldn't bug. I don't know why, so its really hard to fix it. But anyway, the game itself without the WiFi difficulties is amazing!",4
The best mobile game there is. The gacha system is the biggest downside in the game.,4
Fix Dehya,1
"My review got deleted, here it is again... Content has becoming lackluster, I play on pc. Anniversary rewards are basically nothing to all players who've been supporting the game.",1
New character made purposefully and calculatedly terrible. Greedy and moronic. Needs to be fixed.,1
Bpk lembap,1
"keeps saying ""too many request, please try again later"" when changing email or password",1
"I like a game so much, thankyou",4
Amazing banget... Ini game terbaik yang pernah gua temuin,5
Extraordinary Mind-blowing 🤍,5
"I was about to give 5 but now it's 4 because when the update appears I can't open it because I don't have enough storage, I delete my albums and my other games and I still can't open it. I can't play your awesome,cute and cool animation game.",4
Fix Dehya,1
Love u,5
Please fix Dehya.,1
This is the best app!!!!!,5
best game and realistic game ever ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️,5
Ew,1
I love good girl cocogoat,5
"I can't in good conscience recommend this game. Hoyo doesn't listen to their players, and the Dehya situation might be seen as a case of racism: There are five darker skinned characters in this game, one is a starter character, and the others barely function. And then there's Dehya. She was a long-anticipated character who was butchered by Hoyo and they refuse to listen to complaints. Don't support this company's actions. They only want your money and don't care about your satisfaction.",1
I love this app soo much I really want to get kokomi soo bad and your the best genshin impact❤,5
"I was hacked, I didn't use my acct for a year and there's no way to contact or retrieve. Hope you see this pls help.",1
As a mobile player this is the best game I played however I have issues about Dehya's kit (pulled her recentIy) love her as a character and her story quest amazed me. BUT what I don't get is her kit only dealing a few damage and the cooldown in her skill and E. I thought she'll be female diluc but I was wrong. Also pls consider that you've just released a character that everyone waited before 3.5 and disappoint us with a bad kit. Though I don't regret pulling i hope her kit will be fixed soon.,1
The best that I ever played,5
"Prob the best game ive played my while entire life! The characters design,music and storyline are amazing too😭 just wished it would be a little less laggy tho🥲",5
Game was so good but my only problem was it's was a huge file and after that 3.5 update is again a huge file which my phone can't take so can't proceed to play anymore,4
After the new update. Game just stop on its own.. and im back on my home screen.. please fix the issues . And its not my device issue my device is compatible for it.,2
My wishing system seemed to have broken seeing how it isn’t updating on what I did. I'm stuck on the same pity and I don't even know of it's a good thing or a bad thing.,3
"Its fun the first few months then it becomes a chore to play it, repetitive content, boring events with very slow dialogue and no skip button, the main storyline advances very slowly each 3 or 4 updates, world traversal is bad, customization is almost non-existent, the abyss floor is just for primogems but no fun, (PS: I am an AR 57)",1
I love this game or sometimes Because the Boss and it's soo unfair it's so hard to get 5-star!,5
buff dehya please!!!!,1
This game is not for mobile now bruhh💀💀,2
buff dehya it's not fair what you did with her,1
PERFECT,5
I love it! The the new characters they so cute! Co-op mode is very helpful but 1 thing I don't like Is lagging and low internet,5
Good game,5
Buff Dehya!! She's broken and you know it! Just do it please ;W;,1
"It is one of my favorite game but I don't have time to play because of my job. What a pain. I wish, I remained as a kid.",5
amazing game but the mobile version can be worked,4
They murdered dehya.,1
This game is fine,5
Eslay,5
"The lorel, graphics, events and the characters are just 👏👏👏l",5
Ok but that doesn't change the fact that you put the 5* in the picture at lv.20,3
THIS IS VERY GOOD IM SERIOUS,5
Stole my account cant retrieve it,1
Reduce your additional file😭😭😢 20.6 gb to 8gb,1
It's an OK game.,5
"It's one of the best mobile games hands down. People complain about the Gacha, but you don't even need to spend any money like me. However, the performance on mobile is pretty awful",5
Very Amazing The waifus are nice and the climbing Lisa as well but i do have problems with the space so i might stop here It was nice playing since release thank you for making such masterpiece,5
My favorite game by far😭💗,5
It's my favorite game^•^,5
Sooo gooood.,5
It's very fun to play but when we first time play it and install it we have to download resources.It took so long tho but still good grapich 5 star :),5
I am learning cuz im new to this game.,5
besar gamenya yang lebih dari 10 gb imbang dengan kualitas grafik dan alur cerita. banyak detail detail kecil yang menarik dan map yang luas untuk dieksplor.,5
edit: you gave me 400 primo and a gorgeous wing well maybe we can fix this issue ehe~ another edit: I'll turn it back to 5star if yo fix dehya's kit.. man that was the most terrible thing you've ever done after zhongli's first release... wake u and hear us out,1
Really fun so far,4
"Genshin Impact took a really long time to load in (like two hours long) and when the intro played was super slow and laggy. Then I got out of the intro and actually started to play. My character moved without me telling it to, and my camera didn't follow. I died for no reason, I couldn't follow Paimon, and I couldn't control myself. Please try your best to fix this, I would still really like to try this game. Thanks! (P.S. I think a lot of others would appreciate these issues to be fixed too.)",3
Good,5
"What's so tiring about this game? You finally installed such a space-hungry app, played for a few days, and then here comes another 4GB of update. Dafuq! Better delete the stupid game.",1
Cool game,5
"THIS IS SUCH A PERFECT GAME BRO, THE PHYSICS , THE CHARACTERS, THE STYLE, THE GAME IS SO *FRENCH KISS* LOVE THIS GAME",5
I like dain,5
This game is good but its laggy in mobile,5
I really want genshin collab with ml,5
THE NEW UPDATE IS MY FAVORIE UPDATE,5
"Three of my Sisters played this very good Epic Open World RPG Fantasy Game Experience with Mobile Devices, PC Computers n' Laptops, & including PS 4 n' 5, l wished it was including Nintendo Switch too....! Well...! I Played alongside with my 3 Sisters whose got really addicted to this game from Proficient to Experience Advanced Anime Experts. I spend too much time gaining less Primogems but higher Cost...!",4
This is an amazing game! The second I saw it I just needed to continue playing. The visuals and story plots are beautiful. It's very addictive 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMEND,5
"Genshin is really bad at listening to players,they only listen to chinese players hope you buff dehya😠",1
There are many 👾bugs at the game and I only have small amount of energy and always annoying monsters they were everywhere and always get normal characters in spins I hope you see this and fix 🔧 it thank you...,1
"Good game overall. But, releasing a new premium 5-star character that unpractical and unusable. Should have a refund.",2
"will steal your time, doesn't Worth it, play your life, not a game",1
BUFF DEHYA,1
"I really like this game, I'm a big fan, the voice acting is really good the graphics are really good, it's open world, the controls are easy to use, there isn't anything bad I can say about this game!",5
Absolutely brilliant!,5
Buff Dehya,1
The game becomes laggy and crashes each time after major updates!,5
Bubu genshin,4
"Hoyo ignores & censors their players. They refuse to put any real co-op or end-game content in the game, so there is nothing to work toward. They claim this was so they could focus on making characters, but after releasing Dehya in a practically unplayable state despite players begging for her to be fixed (not to mention several other characters with major problems) it's clear that they don't really care about making good characters either. Steer clear of this toxic & censorship-happy company!",1
I love this game everyone should play this game but one thing I don't like isthat they changed the colors of the skin. Like someone was black and they changed the color to white.,5
I hope this game not lagging anymore for phone and the graphic bad recently hopefully it recover,4
"Very nice game. Graphics, Combat and Fighting are good.",5
"I started playing genshin a few months after release, as of current I'm AR 60 and have played this game just about daily. A fair and honest review is my intention. You'll notice if you review some character demos and trailers the lack of creativity for move sets and ultimates as well as very poorly designed character kits. Don't waste your time or energy, not a very rewarding game to play! The music is beautiful and the landscape is great but that's really the only thing going for it currently.",1
Justice for Dehya! Y'all r******.,1
Bring ganyu back before I start sobbing,5
Best game omg,5
Sweet game,5
"Hands down the best game I have ever played! The graphics, the storyline, the characters, the music, everything is just OP!",5
It's a good game so far I'm enjoying hoping for more updates and fixing keep up,5
Holding account hostage by threatening to ban my $5k+ dollars unless I pay them $49.99. Total fraudsters after playing since release. Bye bye,1
"fantastic game amazing 3D graphics game, abundant & eye candy environment. the minus point are need a huge of memory & need re-update & re-download",4
Excellent,5
"This is alot of fun but it keeps crashing even if i teleport to others and sometimes it gets thicker, using staminas doesn't look fun, even when i'm gliding, swimming and climbing. I love how the world looks like but in liyue, the trees become 2D and just following me in my screen, so please, stay safe.",5
The best game ever The graphics quests story's Or back story's is So amazing And relatable I'm waiting For Ayaka! I hope I get her good luck at the phase 2 !,5
"Everything about this game was good, mihoyo make such a excellent work. The story, gameplay, character and quest was good⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
"A very very good game,can you pls make traveler can choose what type of weapon they want to use I think that will be more realistic since traveler is from other world so traveler could choose they weapon depends on their knowledge",5
Love the game so much the free 20 spins when u first play helps since I'm a free to play player I like how the graphics look and how the combat feels and how the element synchronization is but the bad thing is I can't download it on mobile cause it takes all the gb I have and after a week grinding chest makes me feel exhausted but all in all the games worth it,5
Dayum dehya suck so much!,1
Like,5
"Dehya is utter garbage. Thank you for ruining the one character I was most excited for since the start of Sumeru. She was awesome throughout the entire story, but her gameplay, from what was released, will never be good. Dehya is the single WORST character in the game. Her being released in such a state has shattered any faith I have in HoYo going forward. I shall never again spend money on this game unless Dehya gets a proper rework and becomes, at the very least, USABLE.",1
"многие игроки ждали байчжу два года, а разрабы сделали неинтресным и скучным персонажем. его механики и анимации полный ноль",1
can i use geforce now to play genshin .? because i want to use gamepad for android..,3
BUFF DEHYA,1
so goodz so beautiful,1
Best game ever,5
Great,5
Please BUFF Dehya like you did to Zhongli.,1
i no longer know what grass is,5
"I've played genshin since launch and I've wanted to get Dehya since sumeru was first previewed. She has finally been released, and she is weaker and worse than almost all 4 star units, let alone 5 stars. Her damage is poor, her defensive utility is poor. She can't even properly target many bosses with her ult. She barely functions. This company is not getting any more of my money, nor higher than a one-star rating until Dehya gets buffed to be what a 5 star, premium paid character should be.",1
"I open the game, but after I enter a door the screen goes white and it shows 7 symbols. The first 6 symbols fill in but the last one fills half way. Then the game crashes and I don't know what to do.",3
"Good, it's an amazing game",1
"‌ok I love this game Where is my ""Tartaglia"" ??",5
DEHYA 🥲,1
"A pretty well made mobile game, for a casual audience. Beautiful world and music. There's no need to rush, just relax and enjoy the story.",5
Fire so far,5
"I really like this game, I've been playing for a long time,and the graphics, the story, and the characters too,it's beautiful, and pleasing to the eye, this game can make me play a long timee",5
Best mobile games all time,5
"It's really fun, but the amount of storage it need is just to big, and when I update it it lags and the enemies are sometimes not fully loaded, overall it's really fun, the animations are well designed and the characters are also well designed and very pretty.",4
"This game has good graphics and visuals, but when I draw I can't get any good characters and items, that's why I give this game one star and I've spent a lot of money on this game but I get nothing but rubish and I won't spend any more money on this game.",1
"I love this game the lore,music, gameplay,cut seens are just beautiful this game is very great I like how we can play with other people and find friends to play with... but why did I give four stars it's because there is one problem.....sometimes the game lags and it's frustrating to play the game but over all it's a very great game ♥️",4
"It's an amazing game, but I have a problem, I hope you can solve it, when I enter the game on my computer it loads and then the game closes by itself, never happened to me in previous versions, I don't know why that happens, but i hope they can fix it, thank you.",4
"Great story, good gameplay, but lacks controller support on Android (even though controllers are supported on iOS). The mobile controls make this game so hard to play. I cannot give this game more than 2 stars until controllers are supported on Android.",2
👍,5
"Have been playing from the time it was released and I gotta say I seriously love this game.The stories, the quest,the animations, the graphics and overall the songs that are played during explorations and batlles are the best! The characters in the games are insane and fun to play with, their different fighting styles and special animation while using their burst is really cool Every new version that the hoyoverse bring to the travellers is amazing I hope they will suprise me even more in future",5
make dehya usable,1
The best game I have ever played,5
"This game is so good. I have played it nearly every day. It has amazing graphics, character design, and storyline. I recommend this game to everyone",5
"It's good, just for one month.",2
"Full of potential, but ultimately just another money hungry company that doesn't listen to the player base, reaching a point of releasing unfinished and unplayable characters with the premise of being eventually usable with future character releases for team composition. No end game as-well. Really slow paced main story development.",2
Large game but very fun,5
"why is dehya so bad hoyo? try fixing her rework her or something its really bad for a five star that work completely poop. Example when u jump while on her burst, her burst is completely gone. pls hoyo do something",1
Dehya need a buff!!!,1
Buff dehya 🥺 please,1
bad,1
Amazing game super fun but sometimes it takes me out of the game,4
"Genshin Impact is a wonderful open world game, with multi-player once you reach level 16, there are different types of quests and character you can get based on element like, cryo, pryo, anemo and more+ I find Genshin Impact very fun and I think you will too, Genshin is a huge game though and originally on my other SAMSUNG I couldn't get it, but on my new phone I can which is also a Samsung, I'm grateful that I got it back but I feel like it should have been on my original type of Samsung.",5
"this game is good, but you need more storage space, i have to lose my discord and tiktok account for this game, and even if i have more storage in my phone, so hoyoverse, i recommend you to make genshin impact's storage less. thank you.",3
this game is so fun real fun,5
Very bed experience gameplay is laggy even in 8 GB ram. Only increasing size doesn't make game great optimization is very important. So very disappointed by this game.,5
"There's a bug in the character wish banner, second tine that i'm on the guaranteed wish and pull a standard banner character!",1
The game is pccationally good indeed but the problem is the lag and high requirements. Plz could u costomize this so that a range of 6gb ram usesers could play in their android phones😶,4

"the best game i've ever played in my WHOLE LIFEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!- THE DETAILS, STORY , AND GAMEPLAY IS JUST SOOOOO....... AMAZINGGGGGGGG OMAGAGAGAGAAAA !!!!!!",5
I salute to the developer. Even using the phone still working. And a lot of things that you will enjoy. I hope developer also needs be more generous in giving the 5 stars heroes and weapons Hahahha,5
Nice game,4
Lack of controller support made the game difficult to play.,2
I love it,4
I just watch baizhu leaked gameplay and it so disappointing can yall recreate new skill set i dont want to pull for im over boring to play style,2
Huuuu tao de,5
One of my favorite games ever. I love how much storyline there is and I love the adventures you go on.,5
"Please let me win baizhu. Good game, still playing this more than 2 years (841 days till today checked on hoyolab)",5
SADGE,4
This was my first RPG game ever. It was excellent and outstanding.,5
Honestly pretty boring theirs no actual combat the characters will legit never die and kill like any mob/npc and most of this game is traveling I had to do a quest for a hour straight 5 minutes was the actual fighting the rest was walking across the map,2
"Most beautiful game i ever played it has nice chrecters,maps(open world),skins,events,quest are like so so so good it is a worthy game 👍👍",5
The game is really good overall but how can you make such a cool character with a horrible kit??,4
"I enjoy this game and used to be on it 24/7, soon I slowly got bored with it because of how grinding artifacts and fighting bosses got tiring. That aside, the game is extremely beautiful and with the new events rolling in it's finally not feeling so bland. Would recommend!",5
"Looking forward to Dehya so much yet a huge disappoinment. 4sec of burst, like what the hell can you do with 4sec???And the burst will even be cancelled if you jump. That's simply stupid. Not even Keqing can be that weak.",1
Give free primos pls,5
👁️👄👁️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👉👈🙌👍🤌💕💞💓💗🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😈😈😈😈😈😈,5
Uwu,5
Sweet smooth game play. Cool story.,5
over heating my phone,1
plz buff fix dehya,1
Smoother game play and options than SAO. Huge download; hope you have space,5
Amazing,5
It's a really good game and the lag problem is fixed,5
"Love the game, on playstation. Hate playing on touchscreen... I was gonna try to resolve the issue by using my console controller, but there's no option for Android users to use external controls..... Such a shame.... I read reviews from hundreds of people who won't play until this issue is redeemed.....",1
Awesome game. really fun to play. Love to play it. Should try it.,5
Buff dehya,1
I love the app so much it's very fun to play and the graphics are great,5
Extremely unhappy with dehya's performance,1
Buff Deyha.,1
"It's a shame that graphical settings are so limited compared to the settings on PC version. I think render resolution could have more options better than High, because even with the best setting it doesn't look as good as it could look.",5
i really recomend it its good,5
"I'm really enjoying it, it reminds me of zelda",5
Amazing game grate graphics grate display everything in this game is perfect. Amazing characters and huge areas to explore,5
Good 👍,5
Won't update,1
"This game lures you in with exploration, good character designs, a good combat system, and some people like the story. The problem comes when you see that there's nothing to do in the end game. The spiral abyss feels awful, events are extremely short, artifact farming is worse than sitting on a cactus, the game starves you for resources as much as possible to make it seem like there's something to do, and if you start now, you've already missed out on a ton of game-changing limited time weapons.",1
Best game ever but it would be nicer if they added more male characters,5
"Gave it another try. Still a cash grab, I couldn't get a decent character after multiple attempts. It's $30 for 10 draws, and after 15 to 20 accounts, forgot how many cause i gave it a try before, I didn't get a single decent character. That would have been $450 to $600. Just poof out the window. I refuse to spend money on this game cause statistically there's a good chance I won't get a decent character in over $600. Obviously I'm not wasting my bill money on an impossible gacha game.",1
Keeps saying insufficient storage,1
"the overall idea for this game is great, the storyline was really good (in the beginning) and many of the characters are likable and have interesting backstories. When you get later into the game it becomes boring, there's less to do and content is coming out to slowly for me to really enjoy the game. Also, diversity. We need more diverse characters, not only different skin tones but what about playable male children? this really shows what audience the company is trying to market towards",3
Y'all messed up,1
"With the release of Dehya, you should expect future characters to not function correctly. They will sell you on interesting characters in the story, then make them worthless in actual gameplay. Hoyoverse doesn't care about making a fun, balanced experience for their playerbase. Do not play this game.",1
Buff dehya,1
I love it it's too amazing game it's little easy for me that good and I love it,5
Emotional and fun game. The storyline and updates are good until you see primogems and wishes plus characters,5
Game is fun and good been playing for 2 years now. But legitimately asking when are they adding controller support? I mean 2 years of updates but they can't put or haven't tried to making controller support viable for Android???,3
Make dehya better mihoyo,1
Devs continue to ignore player feedback. Releasing Dehya (a highly anticipated character) with an unplayable kit killed my mood for this game.,1
5-star. Best game I've played on mobile in a while.,5
It's such a impressive game with good graphics and such a grate story as well 5 stars,5
"Amazing game with Nirmal controls like oth3r games I've played, 10x better than honkai in every way possible!",5
Pretty cool,5
I love genshin impact so much I play it everyday!,5
I don't know why buffing characters is such a big deal same with giving more challenging content to the ones who want it. Coop isn't really useful and is unneeded in most cases. Adventuring in the game is fun but wish this game utilized it's potential properly. It isn't hard to fix these issues.,2
"It is amazing, but there can be some problems with hacking, I did have to start over because of it. But over all I highly recommend to anyone. I love this game so much!",5
Down to 1-star because of the blatant colorism and racism in this game. With Dehya they once and for all confirmed that they look down on black people. Especially when they are female. All 3 dark skinned female characters are the bottom of every tier list.,1
Buff Dehya you racist piece of sht,1
I love this rpg game so much! Genshin impact is the best so far! I love the storylines and commissions!,5
GUYS I LOST MY 50/50 THIS IS NOT GUD:(,5
"It's nice but it has to have not alot of in order to play, I would have to play it on my other Device but it would disconnect, I'm disappointed smh.",1
Dehya Buff,1
It's good,5
5 star,5
This game is very easy and entertaining it is full of fun adventures And quests and I think that you are going to like it,5
It's the best❤,5
Ok sya ok naman ggggg J B R S J K,5
Why download isn't like tears of themis? It's better for my own metal health to see the download gb lowering instead,3
Nice and easy fun to play,5
21 gb download,1
I'm a endgame player and it's still fun only thing is the quests which are unskipable...the side quests should be skippable atleast..it get so annoying when quests pile up and so much time is gone there....when are we supposed to use the characters we used so much resources ...pls make a skip option cus some of us don't care about the side stories,4
Not perfect but in a good way,5
A good but ultimately flawed game. There is far too much useless dialogue that cant be skipped. The main characracter has basically no voice and the companion character just reiterates the dialgoue point too much.,3
"I absolutely LOVE the exploring aspect of this game! I have done literally nothing but that for the first 2 days I played this game. The combat is fun, a little repetitive at times, but there's plenty of characters to try for it is gacha. Plenty of bosses and dungeons. End game is grinding 'gear'.",5
Buff Dehya,1
"Ok I've been playing this game for a long time so I just thought maybe I should write something new by editing my last review cause I am waiting for my game to get update, well I'll only say this that I am loving the game 😌",5
Love this game wish more games was exactly like this one..,5
kys,1
There was definitely a burnout,3
Beautiful game,5
"This game a lot experience and memories, not forgot graphics very give a beautiful detail and colour, overall 10/10 recommended game.",5
Overall the detail is wonderful and the collection of character are amazing such a great game just a little slow to download and update,5
Was a really good game I got the adventuring 45 which took me about a year-and-a-half and then my account got deleted and I had a really good I'd recommend this game to someone that has a reliable source and a trustworthy account,5
Needs proper diversity,5
I love this game so much it's just it's so hard to get wishes and the cut seen it's bad cuz we can't skip it,4
GAME HAY ĐỒ HOẠ ĐẸP NHƯNG XẤU,1
Perfect,5
"Buen juego, pero el Gachapon es aterrador, gasta más que battle royals como Apex, Fortnite y COD Warzone. Una vez gastas sientes que debes pero NO LO AGAS! compra Bendiciones Lunares o Pases de batalla nunca de la tienda directamente, creeme me agradeceras no haber gastado un dineral cuando te des cuenta que este juego está vacío al final.",3
Good game,5
Game freezes and crashes on S23+,1
"Been playing for almost 3years, I finally ran out of storage. My journey ends here",5
"I wont give this game a 5 star rating unless they give Dehya justice. They introduce this character and knew she has a bit of a following, then they threw the wordt multipliers, procs , and stats on her, then dump her in standard. Bruh, diluc is better than her. XINYAN IS BETTER THAN HER. It doesnt make sense, how could Tighnari be viable when dehya c0 isnt. Fix her",1
Newest 5 star character that we've been waiting months for is worse than the worst 4 star characters in the game. Thanks for absolutely crushing the coolest looking character in the Sumeru cast.,1
"while the game itself is incredible and enjoyable, the only thing i would like more is controller support on an android device. Besides that, this game doesn't have any major flaws (from what I've seen).",5
Know your community's worth not your pride and ego,5
Good game,5
Do dehya justice.,1
Please fix dehya,1
This game sucks it's been one year j started this game i Haven't won a single 50 50 i just give up on this game i am done,5
Best graphic on mobile,5
I really love this game!! Also can you give me 12980 Primo gems please I want to get my 5 stars characters!!! I really like this game!!,5
Buff dehya,1
"To Good. Actually I Can't Describe How Nice The Game Really Is. But I Have Complaint That The Servers In India Are Very Poor. Ping Goes Very High And Cause Lag & FrameDrops. So I Have Request, Please Improve The Servers. Thank You Genshin Impact For This Amazing Game 😍...",5
Improve Dehya's kit you racist piece of trash,1
"1* for killing Dehya. She is so beauty and so weak, her damage doesn't fit even for 4* char",1
It show so much adventures and such amazing landscape. Some monsters can be stronger which adds more exciting experiences. Flat out awesome game and so many friends.,4
جميل,5
Let dehya jump,1
"The game is amazing, it's a lot like legends of Zelda's breath of the wild. I just wish it was easier to do summons, the pity system isn't the problem. It's the fact it's so hard to get a lot of primogems at once. I feel if you increase the number of achievement primogems and how many quests give people would enjoy the game a lot more.",4
Why i cant enter the game it said network timeout but my internet it so fast and smoothly i try to restart my internet and nothing happen its always said network timeout if i login my account i try to delete genshin and install and nothing happen its always said that. Please fix 2.4 network,5
Perfect game ite very easy except the bosses but its cool,5
Fix your characters think fam think,1
I rate this game 10/10 cause the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is great on PC,5
Good,5
"It's a good game, but it takes up sooo much storage",5
Great adventure game,5
✨✨✨swaggy✨✨✨,5
"New review patch 3.5: What has changed? Rating still 3 stars. What's new? Game is still progressing well with events, storyline, characters and regions. What's still bad? The company is still greedy and in additionally they are kinda racist i.e. They introduced 2 dark skinned characters: Xinyan and Dehya with both being useless in their kits. Why can't Dehya be a functional character? What can be improved? Maybe add new endgame and artifacts rng rate? Will I recommend this game? Yes and no.",3
"Game is great, but you need wifi to actually play. Otherwise it keeps closing on you constantly",3
It's very fun but I would like it if it was easier for free to play players to get characters.,5
Justice for Dehya,1
"I love Venti, he is the best archon, Barbatos bless you, Venti is so hot, and amazing",5
"Fantastic world building with fantastic characters and music to accompany it. I'm a bit disappointed with Inazuma Arc Act III because it felt rush and could've been executed much better. Edit: Holy moly, ever since 2.7's Interlude Chapter Archon Quest, the game has been killing it with the story!! Sumeru's Archon Quest was SUCH A MASTERPIECE.",5
"This Is The best open world game in the world you can not change my mind. The story, the elements, The Combat Everything is on point. But Glitchs IT OS THE MOST ANNOYING THING EVER... That is it",5
From the video that I see,5
Everything is great but there is a lot of fps drop in the desert,3
"This game is actually good compared to other games, but there some things which really annoys me, like the starting screen is suuper slow and sometimes the game just crashes randomly and more. Now maybe this has changed today,I'm saying this because I only USED to play this game, I'm not playing it currently. I came here to just put a review.",4
Graphics are at extreme level No Lag but while playing phone get heated ....and the exploring openworld is awesome..,5
It is a really nice game.... But please buff dehya,5
Just 5 stars :),5
What even is the point with dheya srsly she literally has almost no practical usage in any team heck even 4 stars have more utility than her... Honestly damage alone is not the only issue here so frckn fix her!!! What you have done to her is just pure sickening,1
i got addicted..,5
HESSS HEEEREEE GUYSSS 😭😭😭💙💙💙(finally wanderer is playable),5
This game is so good,5
game,4
I cry,1
"I tried to buy buttle pass and crystals from my mobile phone, but got en error, because I registered my account from other platform. Technical support can't solve this problem.",1
Great,5
wow,4
"I'mma say..please do buff dehya and make her OP! having her now ,it's hurt when people keep saying that she's worthless and bad. hoyoverse DO SOMETHING!! I just wanted her to be my strongest pyro dps even since i don't have pyro dps yet.",1
I give it a 5 Star rating bc The game is SO smooth like I almost cried when I was Venti running in monsta so much Thank you for the new character!!!,5
Thanks for giving me raiden ei 😍 in 30 pity after losing to qiqi. 😰 I hope i win on my next 50/50 because i didn't know the feeling of winning 50/50 on the character banner that I want😥,5
Dehya needs a buff,1
This is a good game but when you start downloading the resources when you just first playing this it takes too much time and the download won't pause. I recommend that you would allow players to download resources while opening other apps so they won't get bored and just cancel it.,3
BUFF DIYA NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW,1
This game is very cool and interesting! I love this game! I always support genshin impact!❤️,5
Amazing game amazing graphics but takes up too much space.,4
Nothing new,1
"The recent patches show that they don't really know where they're going gameplay-wise. I would only maybe recommend this for ppl who play for the story (I wouldn't know bc I don't). Anyone else, I would recommend playing another game. From the version 3.0 patches to date (up until the start of patch 3.5 as of writting this review), there are 2 new characters out of 8 that have an interesting kit. Everyone else either is a stronger copy of a previous character or has a poorly thought out kit.",1
Havent yet been able to play the game. Takes so much storage. Theres nothing else for me to delete to make room! But I've heard such good things about it. And I want to play so bad. But the strange usage is so much,3
Fix Dehya,1
حبيت اللعبة كثيييير😘😘😘😘,5
😝😝,5
I lost every 50-50,1
BRUHHHHH,5
"This game is my fav game ever, thank you Hoyoverse ❤️",5
"I will make my point. 1. Dehya, her character is way too weak, even for standard banner character's standard. At least buff her scaling. It doesn't make any sense as of now. 2. You need to take a break. No need to deliver us new story per patch with mediocre result. 3.5 story quest had potential, but i think it's way too rushed and forced. It's like it's unfinished. Calm down a bit... I will update my review later after this. For now, i'm quite disatisfied with genshin's state.",1
Good game,5
"The Zelda Killer! Bought a new phone just to play this game. I have a switch but will probably be playing this always expanding game much longer than I will the, by comparison, static Zelda BotW and TotK.",5
"Buff dehya, I have send you the mail. Please consider it",1
Probably the best game i played it's so interesting,5
"The game has amazing story, characters, iam obsessed with this game",5
I love the game but dehya is so bad I cannot enjoy a character I love. Her jumping cause a complete cancel of her burst which already does so little damage. I hate how you cannot use yelan or xingqui with her. She is so bad that you literally have to force her into a team while you have far better options just to play her.,1
"I find the game so fun getting characters, doing quests, unlocking new maps and places there is so much to do in thing game i recommend it 👌 😀",5
"Пока проходишь сюжет все ок, дальше обычная дрочильня причем здесь нет скипа или автобоя как в тех же ж азур или арк",1
It's game amazing,5
"This game is already great,but i have a little issue with the game mechanic.The resin cap is kinda low considering you need those for alot of things like artifacts,talents,bosses,etc.I really hope Hoyoverse could increase the cap so that players dont have to wait or increase the speed rate of resin regeneration.",5
I LOVE THIS GAME IT'S JUST AMAZING AND ADDICTIVE ! THE TWITS AND EVERYTHING ONG!!,3
"The 3.5 Archon Quest ""CARIBERT, Chapter III: Act VI"". SUCKS! Every Archon Quest has a very good story line and interesting story, EXCEPT Caribert, its not interesting, no Dainsleif screen time. 3.5 Archon Quest is TRASH! I hope the upcoming Archon Quest will improve more, it has to have a interesting story line.",1
Геншин по отзывам лучше роблокса но роблокс держится на 500м скачиваний а свою очередь геншин имеет в десять раз меньше 50м скачиваний жаль конечно роблокс не заслужил первое место,5
No words... Superb game i had ever seen,5
Amazing,5
This app has very nice graphics and animations. It's a great game. But the loading time is too much. Please decrease loading time..... The game would become even more fun if the loading time is decreased.,5
I LOVE IT .,5
♡,5
Best game EVER,5
This is not working from mobil 😡😡😡,1
shame this dev purposely make character kit bad because she'll be in permanent character. at this point there should be no excuse they release character with kit like dehya,1
Best game ever,5
Not bad I gave it 4 stars cuz it's a glitchy game idk what's wrong with it but I think the problem is my iPad I really don know.But still it's a nice game👍,4
It is great (:,5
This game loading too slow like a snail walking to look for a new she'll for 150 years having a very long time to wait it not even that fun at all,2
I got my account can't login,1
Fix Dehya,1
its an amazing game with nice lore and characters but when it comes to farming artifacts the luck is horrible and if u start playing now you miss so many weapons and other things but overall its a nice game to play with friends and alone,4
"Ok. I have to be more honest here. As someone who has played this nearly for a year and went for a hiatus, it was fun and enjoyable! Playing with friends, laughing around and listening to the lores abt the game/charas was entertaining. However at a higher adventure rank, the process would repetitive and a little dry. Even if hoyo comes up with new events, I would be done with it really soon and be bored afterwards. overall it was fun while it lasted, go try it out! it won't disappoint you.",4
FixDeyha,1
I love it but it takes soooooooo long to load,3
The storage is too big,5
This game is so amazing 🔥,5
"Ya no se que hacer... Lo desisntalé, lo reinicié, cambie ajustes, Y NADA! siempre se queda pegado en la 3ra ronda con Tartaglia, NO PUEDO AVANZAR! Alguna solución por favor, el juego es muy entretenido y me gustaría saber que pasa después. El juego va bien, todo lo demás esta bien. Pero llego a la 3ra pelea y se pega, no me deja hacer nada. 😭😭😭😭",3
When mondstat new area release?,5
It is so freaking amazing like OMG,5
Ayooo I like this game,4
"""311 MB download"" okay I know these are normally false cause it only states initial download size... it then had a patch for about a gig, okay that's fine... then I was told insufficient space when I have nearly 20GB of space so I check and the download is almost 21GB more????? Uhmm excuse me? BTW can't download it to an SD card and 95% of the data stays on main device if try to swap to SD storage just a big NOPE.",1
Please add more endgame content,5
"I don't even play this anymore, but it's unforgivable that they release such an underpowered character (Dehya) on purpose, there's no reason her kit should be this bad. This isn't the first time a character has been gimped either. Don't bother spending money on a game that doesn't put thought into game balance. Look for another ARPG or gacha if you don't want to be disappointed every other update.",1
like,5
It's a great game,5
"Honestly, very good game but major issue is, too little characters and very laggy",5
"So far, I'm loving this game but it takes almost all of my storage space and I dislike the fact that I have to delete lots of things just for this game",5
I played this game before and it had nice gameplay but the only thing I hate about this game is how much storage it takes up,4
Fix. Dehya,1
FIX DEHYA ! BUFF HER !,1
Game is full of mini games. So much potential. No end game content. Tragic. Loved it. Let me know if there is ever end game content.,1
This is the best mobile game,5
Love it sleigh,5
GOODBYE GENSHIN NEXT TIME ITS SO LAG AND I CANNT AFFORD EXPENSIVE PHONE TO PLAY IT BUT I ENJOY THIS GAME,5
Awesome,5
İt is addicting I got banned and now have 4 accounts,5
Buff Dehya.,1
wonderful Game 🥰,5
This game is just the best,5
this game is so bad good graphics and story but i play this game im ar 25 but not single 5 star character from 50 wish please fix or i delete,1
"i really love this game but this is infuriating, u have genshin downloaded in my device, then i updated it, when i opened the app it started re-downloading all that resources that are clearly already in my device",4
Damn!!! I love this game. I'm addicted to it man. I'm so happy that it's playable in smartphones. Thankyou for creating such an amazing game.,5
So far this is the best game I have ever played.,5
Fix Dehya.,1
Definitely a 5stars!! Much better than other games well kinda,5
"SO WHAT I LIKE ABOUT GENSHIN THAT I LOVE IT ALOT YOU CAN EARN, FIGHT PEOPLE JOIN PEOPLE ASWELLL",5
Because i have cayno,5
Never gets old!,5
"I love the game on ps4/5, but on Android phones, it's nearly unplayable unless you are a veteran mobile gamer. We need controller support for Android.",4
Wangy wangy thengs hoyovers,5
rame cui,5
Pretty fun to play !!!!I'll give it a 5 star,5
"For a free to play game. This is an incredible game. Open world is great, missions, great detail in the graphics, and game mechanics are smooth. However, definitely have a higher grade phone. I have a lower end and the game still plays but very laggy. It's a larger game to install on the phone and will show it. I mainly play on console because of this reason.",5
"Its a nice game overall but the thing is, it's too hard to get 5 stars sometimes. I only have a 5 star weapon and nothing else. But the game is really nice, I love the characters and all.",4
Cool,4
Company makes characters with darker complexions absolutely unusable Desert quests involve a racist genie calling desert people inferior and saving said genie Predatory monetisation system (gambling),1
"Liked this game, and have played for a while but now they're just releasing top rarity characters completely unfinished with kits like Dehya that only become mildly usable at higher constellations (which costs 1000s of $). Cannot recommend game until this issue ends.",1
Why did you make the new character Dehya soo bad? She is worse than a 4 star,3
"Its really great♡. Don't get me wrong with the review, but the mechanics and puzzles of every new update is getting alot harder and there are alot of side stories that don't really connect to the main story. Gets me with everything else though♡",4
Best game ever,5
"It's a good game. It has good graphics, phenomenal music, heartwarming stories, and lastly well designed characters",5
"I loved this game but sadly got burnt out of it but still it's quite fun but plz make end game a lil more fun, interesting and slight mid hardness",4
"Never been a fan of cutesy anime-inspired art, but I'm enthralled by this game all the same. Love the gameplay, the open-world freedom, and the progression. Just sucks it's such a hefty size on the phone's storage.",3
Best game ever no doubt but with new update every month the storage is just increasing,5
It's great But if it gove a more wish its was nice,5
Good,5
"I had fun playing this but swhen the update released it won't allow me to play it, please fix.",2
Good game,4
Fix Dehya.,1
"Dehya could be a great character that is fun to play, we wait 7 months for her and got hit with a huge disappointment. Plz fix Dehya",1
I love this game its so fun to play and the charecters are sooo cool I recommend if you like exploring and adventure games.,5
Pee.,5
"as an 2years oldbie player this is my first time feel so confused and depressed when pull Dehya and build this character everything she does feel very underpower even compare with 4 star characters like Bennett, Xiangling, ....",1
The most important thing that caught my eyes in genshin impact was: Money and life are not everything and they can't make you stop gaming. I think it's amazing.,5
Skill issue,5
I love the game it's my favorite only problem how big this game is it takes a lot of space but I really love the game itself,4
"Out of a small line of mediocre non-pale playable female characters, their first 5-star had been released. She contends for the title of worst playable character amongst *both* 4 and 5-star characters with her dysfunctional toolkit. She'll also be on the standard banner, meaning she'll be far harder to obtain past her initial run. There's a clear bias in how her design has been treated, amongst the long list of other issues involving Mihoyo and it deserves more scrutiny.",1
Bad game,2
I like it but i hate my dad so much because my dad just makes me a starter now i dont have keqing and sayu😭😭 help me,4
"I really like the game!, the quality and the gameplay and the character design and the plots, everything is just so good! but i do suggest to add does cutscene things where you can re-watch the cutscene you unlocked just like in honkai impact :D",5
This game is really fun but it takes a lot storage so I have to delete it..But I really enjoy it,4
Buff dehya,1
This game is trash. Pay2win,1
"Lag, its very lag but i like it, but i have to delete because its super lag",3
"After 2years+. Currently cant understand the direction on mihoyo is taking whether killing the game, improving it or just pure greed. Latest character Dehya a 5star is soo underwhelming to the point its 4star in disguise. Even the old standard banner character do more better. Anyway not recommended to new people. I alrdy uninstall this game.",1
I like it,5
I loved this game,5
Fix Dehya,1
Nvm it's not their fault it's that fan Base itsself,4

very motivational and very true and very very very good it helped in curing my depression i was a paralyzed figure and this made me jump out of my window. overall great experience and highly recommend ✌️✌️😆😆🤘🤘✨✨🎀🎀🥤🥤😈😈,5
I cannot believe that they made Dehya that bad... hoyoverse is such a greedy company,1
"relaxing, beautiful",5
It takes so much space and I had to delete so much apps just for this?!,2
Size of ge data downloading I very big about 20gb ..m Can't you make it lighter size..,3

"This game, omg, beautiful",5
Go get a life,1
WTH WHAT DID YOU DO WITH DEHYA????,1
I want get 5 star again huhu,5

i love this i started at nov 9 2022 and i finally have xiao my fav try this game it's so good AND GENSHIN PLEASE MAKE XIAOATHER CANON PLEASE,5
AN AMAZING GAME (Edit) only downside is that I had to quit playing because it took up literally ALL my storage space,5
WHY IS THE LOADING SO LONG!? 😡😡😡😡😡🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱,1
File size is too large 20gb biggest game i have seen for Android. Very good graphics and very big map. Overall very good game,5

RIP Dehya,2
I hope my Xiaomi Note 10 can still carry genshin impact until to the end of the story.,5
Eula... Eula?? EULA WHEN??!?!?🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠,5
Nice game,5
It's a wonderful game but I see a problem which I don't like the downloading.....like Jesus it takes like an half an hour to download a single one and I think you could make it for the best game ever,4
Fix Dehya. Please !!,1
I just love this game :),5
They are so pretty,5
Can't express Im pretty satisfaction,5
Fix dehya,1
"Dehya's been released with a broken kit that doesn't have sinergy with anyone and has trouble fitting in a team even for casual overworld gameplay. Please, fix her kit.",1
Fun,5
"Amazing game!! Good graphics, good music Literally everything is good!! As a f2p I think the developers should adjust the weapon banner, but overall it's perfect! . Edit: I uninstalled it cause now I have it on pc. My phone can't handle genshin impact well which is sad. Everytime I opened and clicked to play it would kick me out or freeze the screen. It's really sad",3
The best game i ever played.❤️❤️❤️,5
Gambling addiction 👍,5
FIX DEHYA,1
It has every thing that i want from a game i love it so much😍❤,5
"The game nice overall but one thing that you need to add is vehicle not only water but land,I know there are teleportation but to make it more fun like, travelling a long distance will make it more realistic.I hope you will add these features in the future.",4
"I love this game it's have an amazing graphic,super cool story plot and amazing elements power just love this game but some times it show bugs but still the best game I ever played thx to the game developer 🤔🥰🥰💞😘",5
"There is a trend of good designs but terrible damage for characters all for the sake of money and ""balance"". I would give this a score as low as dehya's poopoo scaling if I could 0.6",1
No storage sigh,5
Amazing,5
Fix Dehya,1
"Its very fun to play.Might be very hard to understand the steps when you first joined Genshin but you'll get the hang of it when you understand the game properly.The graphic,Characters,Events,Places and sounds (e.g Fighting an enemy). This is game is 100% fun to play.Very fun to play events.",5
Very fun game high graphics love it!,5
I love this game but the update man it's always big I only play on data don't have wifi It's hard to update huge files at once.,3
"Guess mihoyo intends to buff the bad characters by making a worse character kit in Dehya. Such wasted potential. If you don't intend her to do high solo damage, fine, but make her at least a decent burgeon reaction trigger. Her cool downs, skill duration, and procs are abyssmal.",1
It's good I like the 5 star characters,5
buff dehya! I demand IMPROVEMENT otherwise I will stop playing this game.dehya turned out to be too weak.,2
"(whaler pov) PLEASE if you read my review, do not attempt to play this game. There is literally no content at the end, when you finish the quests or farmed your characters, everything else is repeating. This game is so boring. Go learn some skill or pick up an instrument and learn how to play it, or watch cat videos. Never install or touch this game this is the most boring game I've ever played. Everything is soulless, low-effort and repeating. The 4.4 rating = FAKE. Value your time do something",1
Good game but they really had to release the darkest skinned girl only to make her trash. Dehya is a nonsense character with no synergy. Hoyoverse didn't listen to their beta testers at all and released a character who's functionally broken.,2
"Great game but it takes up alot of storage space, and it's also kind of hard to get primogems and easy to run out of things to do. While I did enjoy it for a long time, I uninstalled it recently. But I do recommend it! Just make sure to have enough storage lmao",4
"fix dehya, her kit is a joke",1
Bored game,1
changing to 5 stars because i have yanfei now,5
"Awful, it was terrible in every way. Insanely toxic fanbase aswell",1
Best virtual game I ever seen,5
Amazing.,5
Pree fun,5
Purely cos it doesn't have a good movement control. Hate left screen touch fake joy stick controls. If it was touch to move I'd play it for more than 10 seconds,3
I love this game so much by the characters and the storytelling and my cute characters I wished that there was more representation on this game but overall an amazing game and still enjoy the gameplay.,5
Fix Dehya.,1
Great game but when graphic is in middle it makes phone hot . Need new city's already finished 4 country's,5
click bait. i only get 600 primogems..where to get 1k more.,1
Dehya need a bit tweak in her kit and talent scaling so she can be on par with Diluc or another 5 star standard banner,1
"The game is very fun, i play the game for 3 month and I'm AR 55 i have Cyno, Yoimiya, Kazuha, and Qiqi(from zhongli, and now is C2) and have C6 fiscl. Good game :)",5
The story is great love the game,5
Yowai mo,1
Why does my device won't show grass and number damage in my game?? I wanted to showcase my characters but i can't see their damage?,1
Very good game,5
It's a really nice game I'm addicted to it now,5
i like the game but the data pack is too big that i cant enjoy it and it made my phone over heat and theres no option for here on mobile,1
It's beautiful game :),5
buff dehya you racist pigs,1
"не смотря на объем, графика, персонажи и т.д. не лагает. всем советую",5
I can't update,1
"Plays like zelda breath of the wild,good game.",5
"Great that they can release new characters that are so bad it seems like they did it on purpose... fix Dehya, please. Played since beta and have whaled the whole time, but with her release and horrible state, it makes me fear how this game will move forward.",1
Amazing game I enjoyed it!,5
I've played since launch on mobile and PC 2 1/2 years) The games fun with good team building and min/maxing mechanics and good storytelling. But then they ruined the only character I wanted from all of 3.0. since Dehya's unplayable I'm deleting the app on everything. Farewell Travelers,1
1000000000000000000000000/10,5
Love the game give us more 5 Star Characters Please,4
Buff dehya or still 1 star review,1
Buff or rework dehya please :(,5
Just a money grab. It was fun until the one character I was excited for was released and is very very bad. Now people are complaining and the company behind genshin is deleting people's opinions. I can't stand behind a company that treats its player base like this.,1
Tbh this is addicting game but there are a lot of to improve. Will give this time a 3 stars.,3
Why error I can't play it my internet is fast tho,5
"Characters with great appearances and story and a fun exploration and combat system. But it's gacha system relies too much on FOMO that it's just not a healthy game to play. Dehya, the newest character release, in her current state barely functions as a character and performs poorly and is frustrating to use. Yet she is being sold on the limited banner before later being added to standard. She may be useful in the future but you cannot guarantee her if you don't get her now. Same for her weapon.",1
"Really love the graphics, my sister is playing since 2 years",5
"Je ne peux plus jouer au jeux parce qu'il prend trop de place... Sinon les graphiques et le design des personnages sont magnifiques, le gameplay me plaît et il y a toujours quelque chose à faire sur le jeux. Mais svp... Quasiment 30Gb... Je fais comment ?",4
Pleast buff dehya,5
"I love many aspects of this game, however the recent update has been a bit of a mess. Between a mediocre main quest, some underwhelming events and a disastrous new character release I am worried about the game's future. The recent release of Dehya has been met by universal outrage at her complete lack of usability in the game. As she is amazing in every other regard, her gameplay is concerning not just because of how anticipated she was, but because this could easily happen to future characters.",2
Plssssssssssssssssss can you plsss remove lumine in my account plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss I do hate and am sick of my hated character,1
It’s really hard to be excited about anything in this game because of what the developers did to Dehya. It's hard to trust anything this company puts out. Buff Dehya and stop making mid/garbage colored characters.,1
Donatna zalupa,1
Nice 👍🙂,5
بازی خیلی خوب و با کیفیت بالا و انیمه ای هم هست ولی یک ستاره کم دادم چون باید31گیگ بدی تا بالا بی اید,4
👍🏻,5
"Its a really good game, to be honest i dont mind the rewards. We should just continue enjoying the game until the twins finally reunite. I get that there are not much rewards and primogems but this is about exploring mostly, not summoning. (Disclaimer: im not trying to defend anyone)",5
It's a really cool multiplayer game! I really love it!! I can't stop playing!!,5
Nicely done,5
Fix Dehya. She was a hyped up character for so many people and you release her with a less than subpar kit and broken burst (Not even being able to jump while in it without it ending?!) Is absolutely ridiculous.,1
This game is so much fun better than toward of fantacy,5
Kajajaja,5
Dehya's design is just insulting 5 all the people who spend hours and thousands of dollars playing this game. We expect you to not make terrible characters on purpose just to make losing 50/50 as painful as possible.,1
I'm never really gonna give this game five stars it gets a little glitchy from time to time which is kinda annoying ill admit especially the further I get into the story the games not really great with most phones and if I play it to long my phone starts to over heat. Also there's a bit of a problem with timed challenges cause on phones there's always a good few seconds till monsters and such spawn in and it's not untill you fail a challenge by those few seconds that it gets really annoying,3
His game is so fun I love it it's like this game is like cool it's not bad at all I did is downloading now it's going to play this game with my friends named aphmau,5
"good game , nice graphics , best characters ,free primo's to draw .. great story quest 👍👍👍 keep it up ,",5
Good,5
Justice for Dehya,1
"Please upgrade dehya's kit, Hoyoverse !!! She doesn't deserve to be treated like this bad.",1
You guys ruin dehya,1
This game is the best game I ever seen,5
"I understand some games require further download once installed, but 26 GB is outrageous. Seriously, 26 GB!!!! That's the most of any game BY FAR. *UPDATE* C'mon, are you kidding me?! So many players are complaining about the file size and your response to that is to release an update requiring another 1.5 GB?? This is ridiculous. I love this game so much but I only have so much monthly data and space on my phone, I don't know how much more space and data I can waste on this.",1
Awesome,5
"Game was really fun in the beginning, now it's honestly just a hassle.. it's EXTREMELY hard to just get 160 primogems without spending money and that's still just one spin.. you get 5-10 primos for most difficult tasks and missions.",2
this game is relly good to play,5
"Very good,just a bit lagging and some bad graphics. but still. a good adventuring game. Even my old account gone,i think that its because the developers do the best at the game and almost forgot about it.but ok,nothing really critical in this game. (notes) also,its lagging because i use the graphic higher.",5
#FIXDEHYA Im not change the rating until you fix dehya,1
"racist, first candace and now dehya what's the problem with tanned chars mihoyo?",1
"i play on a low end device, and whenever i use hutao's burst or yelan's skill the enemy health bar suddenly disappears. i need to restart my game to fix it back. i hope that this will be fixed since this is just a minor issue, i moreover love the game despite not seeing the health bar of enemies.",5
pauwi nyo na siya pls,1
"Этой компании плевать на ваши время и деньги. Им не интересно делать качественные игры. Их стратегия - сделать приятное первое впечатление, чтобы игрок не обратил внимание на то, в какой обрезанный кусок недоигры он на самом деле играет. Чем дольше вы поддерживаете геншин, тем сильнее будет разочарование которое вас рано или поздно достигнет. У разработчиков нет мастер-плана, это видно на примерах отвратительных боёвки, лора и истории. Я искренне сожалею о том, что играл в это больше двух лет.",1
"The best one I have played so far . Love the graphics , nature , all the landscapes and the sumeru region is beautiful for its its nature as I am a nature loving explorer . Love this game",5
I would love to rate it 5 star if only you can add audio chat in the game. It is hard to play co op if you need to message your teamate everytime you need to go somewhere,4
"Hey hoyoverse, stop being so intentionally racist and fix dehya's kit.",1
I want my money back. Trash dehya,1
It's op,5
Would be 5 stars but when I got a new phone and I lost all progress content I had gathered.,2
make kaveh 5 star,1
"No just no, save yourself before it's to late.",1
"this game is one of my favorites for its unique and well written characters, the immaculate story and lore, the amazing music and beautiful scenery. however, this game has some key issues that NEED to be addressed if it's going to keep going on. 1. resin/artifact system is awful 2. poor communication between devs and players (the surveys don't do much from my observations) and 3. the characters keep getting worse from what I've seen and the gacha system is questionable at best",3
Best game i have ever played.graphics are very good and the game is highly optimised for smooth gameplay.storylines and cut scenes are very good .loved it❤️,5
Is better the game,5
Please add skip dialogue.,3
It is a very good game... Can say one of the best games I have played in the open world genre . Graphics are awesome! I am very much satisfied 😌 with the game .,5
What happened to dehya,1
"Damn, why u gotta do dehya that dirty, she needs a buff, her burst is buggy",1
Sí ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ ㅤㅤㅤㅤ,5
"I got dehya, how come she's weak even qiqi can do higher dmg than her, hyv you're doing dehya dirty. Her design is pretty cool tho but the dmg grrr just can't get over it I should've save my primo for shenhe😭 even shenhe, a support character can do higher dmg than dehya I hope you fix her soon pls notice this review 😭",1
2 stars because you finally gave us a decent claymore,2
"Buff Dehya, but overall getting to the recent patches, there's nothing at the end of this game but grind that's boring and leads to no end game. It's an unfinished horse drawing that's not getting any better.",1
Please genshin i wanted to update it but there's a problem not letting me doawload it :(,5
Fun,5
"It's been 2 years since the game released, and yet you would release a 5* character (Dehya) that is worse than Qiqi (original worst 5*).",1
DILUCCCCC SMASH 1000/10,5
Idk what's with other people complaining too much and I believe that the resin cap is to prevent you for getting addicted. And...the music is top tier for me,5
"The game is fun and beautiful. The only problem is that it's a gacha game. With that you have to either grind or pay to get the newest character or your favorite characters. As a F2P player, it is really hard to grind for primogems and once you get enough gems, you might not even get the character you want. It takes a long time to grind primogems and to me honestly it's not worth it. I keep playing the game now and then but I don't really have motivation to grind because of how repetitive it is.",4
"Absolutely disgusting 3.5 patch with what Hoyoverse has done to Dehya! Couldn't be bothered to fix her kit during beta (what is the point of the testers then?!). Reveals Candace in her gameplay video but not place Candace as one of the 4 star characters in her and Cyno's banner?! (""Let's slap in Bennet, that will fix everything""). Monstadt Windblume event with no Monstadt 5 star character rerun banner? (""Let's give Ayaka a skin and rerun banner cause she is the lovechild of Genshin"") #FixDehya",1
"The game is great, no doubt about it. But there are few things that make this game not perfect. The enemies are all the same and there are a few of them. I understand that the elements are the important thing but could be more kind of enemies. The combat turn too repetitive after playing 20 or 30 hours. And the second thing, the story is kinda boring. But this is not important in this type of game gacha. Even though that the game is gacha, i love it.",4
"BUFF DEHYA, JUST CUS SHE'S A STANDARD 5 STAR DOESN'T MEAN SHE SHOULD BE THE WORST CHARACTER. SHE'S LITERALLY A 5 STAR, SHE SHOULD BE AT LEAST BETTER THAN 4 STARS LIKE XIANGLING OR YANFEI LIKE😤",1
IMA JUST RATE FIVE,5
Wow good job for butchering dehya!,1
This is the best game i ever play. Hopefully on high end android mobile devices and pc will get 120fps.,5
:)) đợi 3 phần thưởng kia về mình tăng thêm sao Edit: tăng sao để fix thằng trẻ trâu 2 năm trước đã đánh giá game 2 sao Nhưng mình h ko còn chơi nữa...,5
Buff Dehya or you lose more players,1
"I love Genshin so much. I will play this game until the main character will find its twin ♥️ Edit: Mar 2, 2023 thoughts: It's been a year playing Genshin Impact and I still love it the first time I fall inluv to this game. My mains are Ningguang and Ayaka 🖤 I'm one happy traveller at Genshin Impact! :)",5
Seruuuu,5
Good game,5
"Love the game, the lore and the characters. I only have a few free space now I'm risking it all for genshin 😭",4
"Disappointed. I love the game for the most part but having my favorite character to be added as a 5 star and get the result of one of the worst characters in the game. To say the least, is very very disappointing and definitely liked some motivation to play.",1
meh it's alright,3
No pvp,1
It takes forever to load,4
Buff dehya,1
"La volvieron a cagar con el nuevo personaje Dehya, de verdad es tan mala que no sirve ni para support y para colmo el problema con su ulti es lo que termino matando al personaje, enserio parece que se esforzaron en hacerla mala y yo ya no puedo hacer nada, ya tiré mis deseos teniendo la esperanza de que sea buena.",1
Never played it and never will if you play this you'll became obesed,1
my storage is full 😭😭,4
fix dehya,1
BUFF DEHYA,1
The best game ever. You really get pretty addicted. And the story of game is very impressive. Love it.,5
For the love of god please buff dehya,1
I have so much fun of adventure to all around the world,5
Its a good gamee!!,5
Ok,3
The storage data keeps on increasing with each update ???? Its already 23 GB .... How much is gonna go up to ...,2
Best game ever existed,5
fix dehya,1
Why is the attack button not working,2
I love it so much I play it with my friends too please make more things so we all can enjoy the game thanks ☺️,5
"idk what just happened but after 3.5 after my genshin keep crashing down on my PC. I uninstall and reinstall the game but it won't work, I still have lots of space too:D",2
Good game. Similar to BOTW. Doesn't shove paid content in your face like other free to play games,5
"The game is fun, the open world is great, but it has a lot of problems: resin takes a long time to regenerate, farming artifacts is a joke, complete lack of endgame and Mihoyo is so greedy that they dont even gave something on the first anniversary of the game. So sad.",3
The best game I've ever played,5
Love This Game So Much,5
fix dehya🙇‍♀️,1
Best game ever,5
Dehya is the most disappointing character to date. She needs a huge bump in damage. Her normal attacks are low AND miss and why advertise her being good at reactions if she's not. Now her skilled had 1 - 1.5 sec proc rate vs 2.5 then yes she would be amazing. Redmane's Blood should boost her damage in some way if not all. Her burst 4 secs with an 18 secs cool down AND cancels when you jump. What if you get frozen? JUST MAKE HER WORK WITH XNGIU/ YELAN/ BEIDOU/ ETC. SHE HAS 0 SYNERGY AND SUPPORT,1
Very emersive! Lovely comfort game too.,5
It 👍,5
I really like this game it's one of go to games to play when am bored,5
"Um problema que tava rolando comigo foi corrigido e isso me fez voltar a jogar, porém o jogo têm alguns outros problemas, como a mal otimização do jogo.",4
I love it but it's files are too big,5
"The game is amazing and cross-play with PC is fantastic. The biggest complaint is that the mobile game doesn't work with controllers, despite the PC version supporting them and the game even seeming like it would with the ability to choose the control method, but with no options to choose from apart from touch.",3
Is there any problem with this game or it is my phone? Dont know how to open it but it was log in now,2
"I would honestly rate this an Infitite star. This game is so marvelous and the visuals and characters are so beautiful and amazing. There is only 1 minor issue I have, the fact that it's pretty much impossible to get characters from quests anymore. I've been trying to get Jean forever. But it's no big deal to me tho. LOVE THIS GAME❤️❤️❤️",5
It requires 21GB of storage to download all assets,1
Good: Art is cute. Exploration can be pretty fun at first. There is a lot of content. Bad: No endgame content. Storyline is boring - doesn't feel like they put in effort. Too many wall of texts expecting players to read through an essay instead of SHOWING it. Idk why but for some reason most of the dark skinned characters are lackluster but almost all the Chinese characters are quite powerful. I get that it's a Chinese game but it irks me. Also it costs a LOT of money to get good characters.,2
"Disappointed with Dehya's kit - underpowered multipliers, clunky to use, and lackluster damage. Needs a complete redo to even be usable.",1
This is one of the best game when I am in a bad mood I hope on it is so fun and there is so much to do.,5
This game is amazing but it takes up a lot of storage. But it's worth it ( in my opinion),4
"The company does not care about players and their prizes are very bad, and the game has become boring only to add characters and there is nothing new",2
How is dehya so bad,1
"The balancing as of recent hasn't been great. I understand there are business decisions and it's just another product trying to make as much as it could before it inevitably dies down. That being said, requiring the players to spend more $ for a game that's already one of the most profitable and popular game kinda feels like a kick in the nuts. Faruzan being unusable before C6 and Dehya being hardly usable at C2? What is the beta even for if they're not planning on taking the feedback from it?",2
Giving one star review because dehya is bad af. Why so racist towards tan character? Fix her.,1
"I use tablet & mobile. Wish I could use a controller instead of touchscreen. Game is complex & immersive, fun to play.",4
"takes all of storage, fun game but lots of incels play it and I can not be associated with it. But it's fun.",4
BUFF DEHYA!,1
Woww I love this game! The characters and the regions are so beautiful! And the character designnnnnn! For that I'm giving 5 stars! This game is the best!,5
Worlds best game FIVE STAR,5
Dehya makes the game an actual challenge to play,2
Amazing I'm in love with this game 😍,5
This game is absolute garbage,1
"I can't believe I'm actually giving this low of a rating for such a great game, but I have become so disappointed with Dehya's kit that I just had to write this. Mihoyo, I really love your game, but advertising a character as ""valiant and powerful"" and saying she does immense pyro damage is really embellishing things to the limit. I would want to spend more on this game, but I can't if pulling for some of my favorite characters grants me a unit that is worse than the ones I own...",1
"This is probably one of the best games i have played, this game may be hard but games that are hard are more fun and enjoyable since you could do a lot of things if its hard, Its hard to get artifacts since you need a higher level but farming is probably the most enjoyable thing you could do in the game.",5
Best game fr,5
"I absolutely love this game but on my birthday was the update, and I couldn't get my gift 😢 I was really looking forward to it but It didn't happen",3
"I really like this game, I just wish the developers valued equality instead of discriminating, I mean how long has it been since Lumine was used for in game tips? Or version update picture? For such a fun game I just wish it respected equality.",2
"Genshin is a great game, interesting story, huge open world, nice combat system, and unique characters. I have been playing over a year now. There are quite a few things wrong with genshin but for me I really missed how paimons voice used to sound like, way back at the start of the game. please have her voice back to the way it was!",4
Nice,5
"I love this game the graphics are nice the characters are nice I love the voice acting it matched all the characters and love the story lines and the characters backstories. There is one bad thing I have to say about the game, it's lack in diversity there are very few dark skinned characters in the game, and when we do get a dark skinned character or tan character they're not even that tanned and look a lot darker because half of the characters in the game are super pale.",4
It a great game,5
No controller support in 2023. Why did you even make this game?,1
Fix dehya.,1
Pleaaaaaaaase nerf deyha . I beg you,1
good open world ever,5
"I absolutely adore this game. Some people think the game is racist, but honestly it's just the lack of diversity. That doesn't always directly mean racism. I love the game, and it's really fun and interesting, but honestly it's one of those games where you just have to try to see if you like it. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, oh well.",4
"Great game, but can you add sand physics to mobile?",5
Why is Dehya so bad? How did this pass QC? How will you apologize to the art and sound team for making such a great design and sound effects just to make her so terrible? There can be an argument made for Kuki syndrome but is the FOMO farming more profitable than just farming the simps? I just don't understand.,1
Turunin size lah yang ngotak dikit lah kami kaum hp kentang sangat tidak menerima ini,1
BEST GAME EVER!!,5
Amazing I also love gambling so much 😍,5
Amazing game I wish that had another version like an anime version,5
I love this game :D,5
They released a character that is significantly worse than pretty much all other characters and refuse to make any balance changes. It is a good game but I could never recommend playing a game with devs that are this incompetent.,1
Graphics are amazing but sometimes my game glitches,5
good game but can be better,5
"It would not let me go in and play the game,and it made me have to delete most of my apps.and i never played",1
"Really good game, great graphics, Great character design, good story. But the game does get REALLY repetitive after playing for a while. Even though I've loved the game for awhile , I've just decided to quit since It got way to repetitive for me, do recommend it though.",3
eh it's mid the game is fine theirs A LOT of gambling always up for that but the one thing for me that was difficult was that the story just doesn't click with me personally that's about all its a fine game but not my cup of tea,4
This is a nice game.its so great form me.,5
Ayaka makes the game a 5/5 🙏,5
This is so great I wonder if it will be on Nintendo,5
pretty cool but ive never been read a story in a game,5
"This may be controversial but I suggest the game to have less events, I feel overwhelmed with many things to do in game plus I have school so my schedule is extremely occupied (as an honor student). Please consider that people have things to do in real life too, if this continues there will be less people playing the game due to burnout. And I'm one. I love the game though so there's no way I'll delete it unless I have no storage left.",4
I hate this game. It is too free with what ppl can say. I got harassed and hurt so many times.,1
بازی واقعا با کیفیتیه,5
this game made me suffer and now i have a gambling addiction pls dont download this game,1
"lovely game, but wayyyyy too much storage and not enough resin!",2
Ty for the refund! This is an amazing game,4
That one's for making Dehya trash.,1
Bad bad garbage,1
Good,5
Buff deyha,1
"Absolutely LOVE Genshin Impact! I've been here from the very beginning and it's been so fun to watch this game improve and get even better. I love the story, the characters, the world, the mechanics (except a bit for the eternal artifact grind), all of it! Genshin is also even better than most games of this type whereas the sexualization of its characters leans more towards being equal between males and females. The gacha pity is better than most games, too. 11/10 See you out there, Travellers!",5
