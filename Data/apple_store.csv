"Summing this entire review up in one statement, this is, hands down, one of the most polished and near-perfected rpg games available and the evidential effort instilled in the unique features and personalities of every last character, environment and sound effect reflect Genshin‚Äôs beauty very profoundly. There are hundreds of positive factors this game wraps around, but the primary reason why this review isn‚Äôt completely five stars is because after about 3 weeks of in-depth play, you start to realize exactly where  certain mobs spawn, just how many of that ONE type of the same exact weapon you earn through the wishes you obtain every single day of gameplay. That being said, Genshin loses its ‚Äúunwrapped-gift‚Äù charm (intentional metaphor) and eventually becomes somewhat of a chore once you realize spawns, camps, and challenges never change in location and aren‚Äôt really surprises once you find them (unwrap their features) once. You find chests in the exact same spot and everything as well, not to mention, obtaining the same exact weapons through wishes every time kills the thrill of spending tokens or whatever the money system is called (I don‚Äôt remember) each time and looking forward to something new. Six weeks of gameplay and the lack of random events added to repetition completely killed my interest. Beautiful game, well developed, but way too predictable.",4
"I remember starting Genshin with a wondrous. Everything was so new and exiting. I started in April. I still remember freezing in dragonspine or worried about if I had enough eggs to keep going during my battle. The journeys and quests were endless. This was until AR 47 or somewhere around there. All the quests were completed and most regions (Only two around) were all completed. At this point, the Inazuman word had spread, and people were talking about saving for kazuha, or Ayaka. Once Kazuha came out, is when I stopped being a bit bored again. I had managed to pull him as my first 5* too and was pretty excited, which got me back in. Before all I was doing we‚Äôre commissions and then either farm artifacts or farm ley lines. Now I was on a bit more. Inazuma was just about to be out, so I used my fragile resin to farm a bit more. And finally, the arrival of inazuma. It kept me up. I was back to that curious me. Then as time slowly passed, it went away again. Now the most saving me from boredom are the events. This game is dear to me. But it takes so long for a new ‚ÄúBest new quest!‚Äù To come out. I remember the golden apple archipelago. That was one of the best quests I was able to be apart of. But once it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone. This game is awsome fun and great. Enjoy it while it lasts. Because at some point you will be stuck in this endless cycle of commissions+farming every single day. Repetitive, and gets tiring. But I still love you.",5
"Okay I love Genshin impact honestly I have an addiction to it l have played it everyday since I have gotten it. It‚Äôs a great game and it‚Äôs really fun I would like to say I play on mobile which it works fine but it takes up a good bit of storage it is worth it because it doesn‚Äôt really take up that much room I think people really over exaggerate how much it really takes up. Coming from me that‚Äôs a lot because I‚Äôm a person who will most likely always have their storage completely full, and I had no problem downloading this game.  I would also like to say this game is insanely like the graphics are incredible I can‚Äôt even imagine how long it must have taken to make this game then test it out it is literally amazing I love it! I also would like to say GENSHIN IS NOT A RIPOFF OF BREATH OF THE WILD 
And I‚Äôm not saying that Zelda isn‚Äôt a good game I love breath of the wild but they are two completely different games bro they are just both excellent exploring games, but there are several different between them the whole plot is completely different and in Zelda you can only play as link but in genshin there are several different characters. In my opinion the only major similarity is that there both exploring games. It must have taken the creator of Genshin Impact a very very long time to make and test this game and to call it a ripoff of another game even though it‚Äôs literally not is really rude because they worked hard to make this game.",5
"I‚Äôm going to start by saying that I love this game. It has kept me out of boredom in the pandemic quite a lot. However, there are some major problems with it, so I have two messages, one for players and one for the developers: Developers: Though game has diverse settings and cultures, the actual skin color and representation of the poc characters is sadly lacking. There are more people with tan color skin than I would have thought according to the reviews I‚Äôve seen before going to Sumeru, but the hair, clothing, and darkness of the skin just doesn‚Äôt represent what those people would look like in real life. PLEASE CHANGE THIS Make more realistic poc. Trust me, this will make more people play! People are quitting because of the lack of diversity, and it would be in your best interest to fit their needs. And of course it;s the right thing to do. Players: I understand many of you are upset because of the lack of diversity in this game. And I fully agree that needs to game. But if that‚Äôs the only reason you don‚Äôt want to play, I encourage you to give it a chance. It might not be the best game ever, but the amount of effort and detail that goes into making something like this shouldn‚Äôt be under appreciated. If anything, just look at the graphics. Just so you know, you definitely don‚Äôt have pay for anything. I haven‚Äôt and I‚Äôve still gotten pretty far in the game. Thanks for reading, M ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"The title of this review says it all. Let me start from the day I installed Genshin impact. It took me a long time to create an account, because it kept saying that ‚Äúthe password wasn‚Äôt secure‚Äù. However, after I got through that part, the exciting stuff began. The storyline was so exciting, and the characters were great. Yes, the gacha is annoying, (you have to grind 90 rolls to get a five star) but it‚Äôs still good. A little bit into the game I realized the game kept crashing (if you play on pc or maybe PS4 then you‚Äôll probably have this problem less often, but I‚Äôm playing on mobile)it‚Äôs very annoying when it crashes of course, but I deal with it. Another thing about this game is that some challenges/quests are kinda hard (ex., you keep getting frozen when trying to defeat enemies), but I just search up guides to figure it out. Also, I heard the spiral abyss is really hard. Plus, to do good damage you need good artifacts, and those artifacts don‚Äôt always have good substats. This game is still in progress, so the entire storyline isn‚Äôt out yet. The details in this game are stunning, for example you can see the characters breath in cold areas, and the npc‚Äôs react when you bump into/ use attacks near them. the characters all have cool idle animations, plus the voice actors are great. The events in Genshin are also extremely fun, too and so far all the updates have been great. Again, the title says it all.",5
"In my many years of trying to find games to play on the phone and ACTUALLY being satisfied and having something to play till 3 am. Genshin Impact has shown me that I waited long enough, the game asked me to write a review but I just couldn‚Äôt stop playing at the time. I have a few suggestions but the game doesn‚Äôt need major changes the updates are spontaneous but that is to come of a new game so it‚Äôs not a complaint, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that you can like and that has beautiful graphics along with fighting mechanics then this is your game. With the dungeons and monsters and many different places to visit it‚Äôs even fun just running around looking at the world, although one suggestion I have is that instead of just food to heal your party members why not add craftable health potions and such so my character doesn‚Äôt feel sick when eating so much üòÇ. The purity and smooth play of the game is phenomenal though, I‚Äôve already suggested it to a dozen people and I think this game has greater potential, on the other hand I was opening this was a open world multiplayer aswell, but the story says otherwise. If you need to relax and relieve stress this is the game, but if you want to play with friends and find people to meet you better have them added or you‚Äôll be alone like I am! All in all having a better friends system would be awesome but the game itself is phenomenal! Paimon is so Kawaii!!!!!",5
"I‚Äôve been burnt out from multiple games but for genshin, it just never seemed to go away. I remember starting this game last year and I was addicted to say the least. I had gone through a phase and during my worst times, this was my only source of comfort. I love this game for that as it saved me from everything that was going on at the time. I used to never think I would get tired of genshin but I did. I don‚Äôt know if I can force myself to play anymore as its tiring to even open it. But the memories I‚Äôve made and shared with my friends, they were priceless and I don‚Äôt want to but sometimes it‚Äôs good to change. Im putting this off as of right now. Its been weeks since I opened this game but everytime I do, its as if something comes over me. I just lay there and admire what I had spent over almost 2 years grinding and caring for. I smile everytime I look over my builds, characters, weapons. I have spent quite a lot on this game but I don‚Äôt regret it. I would never regret anything I have spent on this game. It saved me I suppose you could say. But being burnt out is ok. I hope that one day, I‚Äôll get that same energy I used to have to be able to play it every second of the day. Its fine if I dont either, the memories I made and friends I created will forever stay in my heart. (now that im rereading this it sounds really cringy but anywho its a good game so download it!)",5
"This game is pretty incredible when you first start playing. There‚Äôs plenty of content, characters, and so on. However, when you start playing more you‚Äôll slowly realize that there‚Äôs less content for higher AR players. And that‚Äôs the problem. Less content means it‚Äôs harder to grind for primogems, not to mention the rewards are so little which makes it even more difficult. To make it worse primogems are WAY too overpriced. You cant even get to pity for $100. I feel as if mihoyo doesn‚Äôt care about our concerns and only wants our money. New banners are coming out, and there‚Äôs not really any way for you to grind for wishes. After you reach 100% world exploration and get to a high AR there‚Äôs almost nothing to look forward to in the game except for daily‚Äôs, domains, and new events. There‚Äôs a problem with the resin too. There should at least be a way for you to get more resin once you reach a certain AR. Other than that, you just do your daily‚Äôs and log off. And another thing, the wish system is also overpriced. Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense for it to be 100 primogems for one wish at least? Considering how hard it is to get primos. If you cant do that, then at least make it a little more easier to get farm primogems in the game. For example, let us earn primogems in domains, like the Abyss. It doesn‚Äôt have to be much, just something. You really can‚Äôt expect much from this game after a while, and it eventually becomes boring.",3
"this game is the best game I‚Äôve ever downloaded! it‚Äôs a great open word game, the plot is amazing and all the characters very well designed and have great backgrounds. i love all the fun things you can experience in this game like domains, bosses, and the wishing system (getting characters). and the system of daily commissions, and you‚Äôre reputation in different places to get wind gliders is super fun! also there‚Äôs gods that rule over the seven nations of Teyvet, and all the gods will eventually become playable characters, like Venti (anemo archon), Zhongli (geo archon), and Baal that will be coming soon (electro archon). also every nation has something special like Mondstat is the city of freedom, Liyue is the city of contracts, and Inazuma is the city of eternity and etc. some things are a little too complicated for me, for example building characters with artifacts, also artifacts help a lot with getting though with enemy‚Äôs faster (better dmg, def, hp.), but I just try my best. something I don‚Äôt understand is and I don‚Äôt like is that you can‚Äôt craft and unlock teleport waypoints and talk to people while in co-op mode. and I also love the new map, but I‚Äôm not so good at puzzles lol. also visions and all the elements, pyro, hydro, anemo, electro, dendro, cryo, geo. something I wanted added to the game is being able to pet animals, although it seems kinda silly I still think it‚Äôs cute. pls download this game its the best, enjoyy! ü§ç",5
"I‚Äôm one of those people who Judges a game by its video/screenshots/price/platform rather than description so at first, I personally thought it was some copy or ripoff of another game that costs 60$ more that will be left unnamed, but it‚Äôs much different. There are some things I would love changes too like, you don‚Äôt start with so much stuff, you can have two to three characters out as an a.i. that you can switch to when you need them for a puzzle or you want to get them out of a predicament instead of having one out at a time and hear characters that may not be there, with that edition you could have a healer and strategize rather than switching to what you need when you need it out of nowhere. Another thing is that the gameplay and story through me off from how original and fun it was for a game I was initially going to play as a time waster. I would quiet enjoy to have more skins for your characters and voiced dialogue/more story into the main character instead of a random flying thing that always seems starved. I love the mystery so if you are into that sort of thing I think that you would like it although even with fast travel, travel is quiet annoying and unfortunately, I have no ideas for that

TL/DR: You should play because of story and animations if not because it‚Äôs free

PS: I played this on PS4 though I tried it on iPhone, and I didn‚Äôt like the controls",5
"Overall the game is great, but there are some major problems. While some QoL changes have been made since I last considered reviewing the game there is some new insight now that I‚Äôve spent a small amount of money on the game. Mostly, my biggest complaint is with the weapon banner wish. Even though they added a guarantee system, it‚Äôs still incredibly hard for smaller spenders to get the weapons they want. I won twice and got both of the ones I wanted but that‚Äôs incredibly rare and most people don‚Äôt have that sort of luck. I know they don‚Äôt take feedback very often, especially in such an oversaturated category, but I wish the Fate Points would carry over to the banners. It is still reasonably hard to get the correct weapon, but right now, I feel very discouraged from spending my money on the banner because if I don‚Äôt spend enough then all of it will go to waste.

I also have some concerns for how this game will conclude. I don‚Äôt think the system of adding so many new characters every single update is very sustainable. In HI3 each of them has different battlesuits but the characters are technically the same people, so the story is somewhat more streamlined. I also think a condensed resin/resin refresh rate/resin cap increase is overdue since Sumeru will probably come with many more weekly bosses.",5
"This game is insane. I‚Äôve played now for a total of 42 days, according to HoyoLab. Easily hundreds of hours. I play every day for hours. This is the only game I'm currently investing time in. And let me say it is WORTH your time. A HUGE open world not pay to win and complete flexibility with how you play. I have invested around $20 total over the course of my time and it was for 1 character, Xiao. I didn't get him, however i did end up getting him with a free wish i received, go figure. But this is not like a normal GATCHA game. You get so many characters with the chance at more and more completely for free. You never have to spend money. There is no pay wall and the story lines are fantastic. I literally cant type out enough praise for this game. Its the best game i have played hands down in a very very long time. 
It does need some more end-game or late-game content, especially because at AR37 the story just stops. 
DEVS: This game is a huge accomplishment and you should all be proud. Its extremely ambitious, especially if you are planning on including zones that represent every element, however, keep with it. You guys can have THE best game of all time if you listen to your fan base and keep this momentum up! The lantern rite event was absolutely incredible! 
P.S. try and keep the tower defense mini game in! Its so much fun just to pass time! And it gives us a reason to keep playing after we finish our daily grind!",5
"I‚Äôve only been playing for about 7 months now. I‚Äôm AR 50, a mobile player and a light spender. There are some really great things and some not so great things I‚Äôve noticed about Genshin Impact. 
Great things: I love the graphics and the effort and thought put into all the character‚Äôs designs and backstories. All the areas and quests are flawless and beautifully made. The storyline makes sense and is really fun to play out. 
Not so great things: I don‚Äôt like that in the entire game, there are only two characters who are maybe even a bit tan, and they‚Äôre only four-stars! There is no Black representation whatsoever. Same with non-binary and transgender characters. There isn‚Äôt a gender-neutral traveler option; you‚Äôre just either Aether or Lumine. The wishing system is also a bit sucky. Free to play players have a horrible time saving primo gems. You almost HAVE to spend money to get any good characters. Even if you do spend money and get lots of primo gems, you‚Äôre still not guaranteed the character you want. This game also takes up a LOT of storage, especially on mobile. PC edition is much better than mobile. The graphics are better, it glitches less, on and on and on. Hoyoverse also does nothing to recognize player‚Äôs concerns and takes advantage of the fact that you practically have to spend money to succeed in this game. 
This is not a bad game, it just has some issues that need to be addressed.",4
When I first started I had no idea how to play it would be nice if before you played there where instructions but idk if there where I didn‚Äôt actually read or remember so if there word my bad!!! But I had no idea how to play so I didn‚Äôt like it at first. Eventually I figured it out and went to the statue of the seven the first one they tell us to go too I thought it was pretty interesting since then. After wards I went to mondstant (idk how to spell it sorry) and that‚Äôs my favorite part bc I thought I would be alone in the game and that I would have to make camp fires and that but At the end there was a town where u can buy stuff and relax ‚Ä¶ etc witch is great!!! Therefore came the missions and at first I did all of them and defeat every enemy I saw but when I continued playing I started to avoid the fights because I just wanted to get to the target like if it was a walk in the part but the coding in genshin made it very hard meaning that it was nearly imposible to not be attacked by enemy‚Äôs but even so I did avoid the enemy‚Äôs . But I came to realize if I fight more enemy‚Äôs I get leveled up! So that‚Äôs great I avoid but also fight sometimes. Right now currently having a hard time with the mountains it‚Äôs pretty hard to stay warm and idk how to pass the mission it‚Äôs called ‚Äúlost in the snow‚Äù. - but overall I loved the game it makes me feel all sorts of emotions!!!!,5
"Overall, Genshin Impact was a pretty cool game at the beginning. Including the immaculate amount of high quality graphics and the absolutely adorable designs, such as Paimon. Although, after at least 30 minutes, I believe, of downloading the full version, following Amber and completing quests, all the way to discovering the temple and fighting the monsters, I had uncovered a level where you had to fly to reach the other side. You were stuck on a huge cliff, on one side, a huge gap in the middle, and the other side. The instructions that Amber had given me were to fly across the gap to get to the other side. After all, I had just discovered the game ability to fly a while ago. Thinking this was easy, I concentratedly pressed the button and attempted to fly across the gorge, only to be sent down into the ""abyss"" and be revived. Just then I had discovered that your characters could die, unfortunately. I repeatedly tried over and over to fly across the gorge without the game automatically making my character sink in a sort of slow matter, enough time to make me fail to reach the other side. My lives were decreasing and soon enough, the only character left I could use was Amber. Eventually I just gave up. Developer, do you think you could possibly consider this problem that I, a mobile player, have been having? I cannot play Genshin Impact until the ""glitch"" has been fixed, since my lives are decreasing every try. Sincerely, -An Upset Player.",3
"As a heavy genshin daily player, I‚Äôd like to say that this is the most fun game I had in quite some time. The character designs are great, the voice lines are great, and the graphics are truest stunning (playing on a pc/ iPhone 13 pro). However, this game does come with several flaws. First of all, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room. Please improve your resin system. With more content than ever, we players need more resin than ever. Please increase resin tick/gain speed to 5 min per, and increase resin cap to 200. This would help a lot. Furthermore, the content in this game is kinda drying out. I‚Äôve done all the quests there are and it gets boring after some time. The only thing left to do is to farm for talent up materials or artifacts, which relies on RESIN. Additionally, you should improve your daily commission system, an improvement towards the expedition system where it's auto or a resend button would be nice. I'd also like to suggest having an expedition where you could get primogemms,, but have a chance of failing to get them. Please also buff certain characters such as yoimiya, Kokomi, these 5* are overshadowed by other characters. Bennet should be nerfed, as he single handedly can care an entire abyss team. Make his healing stop at 60% and reduce his attack buff. Also buff qiqi and keqing. Your character balance is needed more than ever",5
"Before this game my life was a barren wasteland of‚Ä¶ well crap.. it was crap most definitely crap. Then one evening while talking to a friend on discord they happen to be streaming it, I was like ‚Äúheyyy whatcha playin‚Äô there??‚Äù Thus Genshin Impact was downloaded onto my phone. Now.. at first I was like, ‚Äúthis game is kinda hard‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs kinda strange‚Äù, but.. as time progressed I got more and more interested in the stories, quests, themes etc. Then a couple months into playing Eula happened, I was awestruck, I was mesmerized, I was completely hypnotized by that blue hair and oh so thique thighs she has. But what captured my attention more than her character design, was her impeccable swordsmanship. The way she swings her claymore with such grace and beauty just.. *Mwuah* magnifique! Now lemme tell ya I dumped a little over $300 on her. I ended up pulling Diluc before her sadly losing my 50/50 but it was all worth it once I got her in my party. I will add as a final touch to this review, that Genshin Impact has saved me from lots of depression, this game makes me feel good, takes my mind out of the dark and brings me such joy I cannot describe it through words alone. For that I thank you Mihoyo, you‚Äôve helped me, and you‚Äôve helped thousands of other chronically depressed teens who are probably failing school as well just like me. Thank you so much. *wipes a tear away*",5
"I have played this game since its release, and so far, I still think it‚Äôs a good game. I really love the beautiful graphics and characters! The storyline and the voice acting is great, too. I also enjoy doing the events! I love the Co-op feature; it‚Äôs more fun to play with other players. As an F2P, I can assure you that with enough patience and grinding, you will do fine. It‚Äôs a self-paced game, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about trying to catch up with other players. Alright, now that I have said the pros, here are the cons of this game: the gacha rates, how little primogems we earn, and the grinding. It‚Äôs hard to get a five-star character. I get that, but after maybe like 4-5 x10 pulls and only getting duplicate characters & weapons? It‚Äôs hard to earn primogems to begin with, and the gacha rates does not make too happy about it. Like I said, it is also hard to earn primogems since you earn little by little each day. I‚Äôm not complaining too much about the grinding, but I will just tell you that it gets harder and harder as you level your characters up. In doing so, you must have a lot of patience and time. All-in-all, this game is pretty good despite some flaws here and there. I understand that the developer needs to make money, hence the pretty low gacha rates. However, I think this game is worth playing if you overlook the low gacha rates lol.",5
"So at first I was going to play this on PC, yet my computer is pretty slow and this game doesn‚Äôt work very well on it, so I usually play in my phone. So far I‚Äôm at Adventure Rank 27, and I‚Äôve had almost no problems with the game. The storyline is great and there‚Äôs almost always something to do whether it‚Äôs the main story, side quests, daily commissions, or just exploring. The one thing that‚Äôs bad about this, as I‚Äôve seen mentioned a lot before, is the resin system. The resin is the main part of the game that helps you level faster, but it regenerates at 1 per 8 minutes with a limit of 120. This can lead to a boring hour of just wandering and waiting for the resin to regenerate. Now onto the effect it has on my device. I‚Äôve seen others say that it heats up your device pretty quickly, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs only a tiny bit faster at heating your device up as other games are. Now the devise I use is an IPhone SE that I got in October 2020, so it‚Äôs fairly new and had lots of storage when I decided to download. I‚Äôm glad I had lots of storage available because this game takes up around 4GB and more of storage on your device. The 4GB was expected thought because of the amazing game graphics and quality of gameplay, which at first glance does not look like it could fit on a mobile device. I‚Äôll continue to play the game and I can‚Äôt wait for new updates and more stories!",5
"I never usually play these kinds of games. Lately even, I‚Äôve been playing things like Escape from Tarkov and have been fiddling around in Conan Exiles. But this game is insane. Maybe I‚Äôm crazy, but at first I thought it would be one of those overcrowded mmo‚Äôs with a poorly written story but I have been and stayed intrigued in even side quests! The music is beautiful, the way it was written so well for all the different places and events, I love the effort they put into it. Graphics are pretty good, they‚Äôre not intended to be top of the line realistic or anything so for the type of game it is, the graphics are quite beautiful. This is a game where you‚Äôre not required to pay to play (of course, it makes things easier), despite it being free. You can actually earn currency and things such as primogems just from quests and exploring, and leveling up becomes really difficult after a while but it‚Äôs obviously still possible. The game is all around easy to grasp and the characters are each unique and well made. I‚Äôve been glued to this game for the past few weeks and that‚Äôs saying something for myself. I usually like a game for a couple days and throw it away. But this, I haven‚Äôt played a game this much since Divinity II and Ark. I really love everything that has been put into this game and can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes.",5
First of all let me say I was pleasantly suprised at what this game could offer!! There is so much stuff to do and it never runs out! Now let me say I NEVER write reviews but this game blew my mind. The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because of the lack of changing clothes option you would think with all these options and customizational paths you would be able to at least change your clothes or your hair it would be so cool if you could change clothes or even your hair!! Like you could cut it or make it longer or different hairstyles things like that of course you would have to pay for the clothes and getting your hair done. I don‚Äôt think you should be able to change your hair color though since you are looking for someone that looks like you so being a whole different color of hair wouldn‚Äôt really match the description. So yeah you don‚Äôt have to come to the hair thing super quickly just start off with a clothing store in Mondstadt and I notice they mention they know you are not from around there when they see or mention your clothes so make different clothing in different stores but accustomed to the city. But start off small and just continue updating the game I think it would add a whole other aspect to the game making it even more fun than it already is! I know it would for me!! Other than that the game is fantastic!,4
"This game is incredible! Endgame can be quite slow but as of recently, they‚Äôve been leaving us with amazing places to explore that are so beautiful and fun! The challenge of some stuff has been making it a lot more interesting. If you are into lore, this story has a nice plot to it as well and I definitely think it‚Äôs worth mentioning. Besides that, you can play without spending any money. This has its ups and downs, mostly downs to some so I think I should mention about it. I definitely have had a better experience with this than others so I‚Äôd like to warn and recommend some things if you plan to play f2p. As a f2p(free to play) this game can become a double edged sword when you are working with the gacha system. I cannot stress how many times people will expect the gacha system to work in their favor and then quite the game because it didn‚Äôt work their way..! If you have to Rely on Luck to get the character you want, don‚Äôt expect to get them! Xd You shouldn't rely on luck, I‚Äôve seen it through my brothers, it does not end up well half the time. Also, plan ahead! There will be times in the game play when you will be guaranteed the next character you want! So plan it out well and save your primogems (the Gacha currency for wishing)for that certain character.",5
"This is a wonderful RPG with like-able characters who have great abilities. I stopped playing this game because it was too expensive! I pulled 2 5-star weapons other than the one I wanted. I was guaranteed to get Baal's weapon the next time I pulled a 5-star weapon, but at what cost? I spent so much money to pull for a weapon that I never got. The only 5-star character I enjoyed is Eula. But it took weeks or maybe months to get decent artifacts. Even if you don't spend money I think you will be disappointed because the rewards aren't worth the amount of time it takes to earn them. I think that it should a little easier to pull 5 stars and decent artifacts. I also think the daily commission rewards should slightly increase with a players Adventure Rank. I don't think getting rewards should be easy but I shouldn't feel like I am playing the lottery either. 

I think there should be reruns for popular characters like Venti, Xiao, and Hu-Tao. A separate banner that changes periodically for past banners would be great. There are so many players who are saving primogems for characters in previous banners. It's disappointing when you play a character's story quest, get to use the characters on trial and then thats it. 

The world itself is amazing and I love the stories as well. I am still a big fan of Venti and other characters. I may play the again later in the future.",4
"-Opinions out of the way I love the game, I believe it to be a very good Free to Play game. Especially as a Free to Play mobile game, *cough* PC is better. Anyways I can see why it‚Äôs off putting for some, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a breath of the wild clone‚Äù, ‚Äúthe gacha rates are terrible‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs over hype‚Äù, and e.t.c. 
-Honestly if you seen Free to Play games out there they are always ‚Äúcopies‚Äù or just plain ripoff of other games. For instance, PUBG and Fornite, Overwatch and Paladins, and many more. People tend to side with games that they played first and hate the others. An I do see that many of the stuff from Breath of the Wild is being copied in this game. 
-Ok for those who complain about the gacha rates, you obviously haven‚Äôt played any gacha games or maybe you just have bad luck. Also it‚Äôs a Free to Play game made in Asia, what do you expect. If you can‚Äôt be a whale, flop! 
-Can‚Äôt really say much on the overhype thing, I too get that feeling with other games sometimes. All I can really say is to play it and find out, like just play ‚ÄúFree to Play‚Äù for like a good amount of time to see if you like it and if not then that‚Äôs ok. 
-In the end, in all I think that Genshin Impact is hopefully putting a higher standard on game quality for other mobile game and gacha games. Just trying to say that I‚Äôm Addicted to this game, if you got far to reading this then pats on you. üëç",5
"This game is great overall but I think it needs a bit of customization like a character creator where you can make your own character when you go into it you need to pay 2 primo gems to make your own character and it will also ask if you want your own animations and moves witch cost 10 primo gems you can choose yes or no when you get into the character creator it will ask if you want a male, female or a small female after selecting it will ask your characters name when after you Type it in it will show step one the eyes you will be able to customize the eyelashes eye color and eye shape and eye size after that step 2 is mouth you will be able to choose from cat mouth normal mouth and squiggly mouth and lipstick step 3 is hair you will be able to choose bangs side bangs back hair and ponytails and colors step4 will be what type of character you want a cat like diona a elf or a human step5 will be to choose your skin color step6 will be for the ones who payed the primo gems for custom animations and moves if your on a pc you can upload your own animations and moves after all of that you will chose your weapon, hat, glasses, hoodie, top, skirt, socks and dress if you want you can change your character for free later on that‚Äôs all I got to say as I said overall the game is good but it needs customization thanks if you put this in the game.",4
"So first problem is getting the materials, you can either buy them ONCE at souvenir shops only once, there‚Äôs never going to restock, which is a stupid idea if you‚Äôre gonna put them there. You can‚Äôt choose what day to get those materials you need, you have to wait every other day for them. Upgrading characters and weapons is already hard as it is, like getting something from a boss and it taking it forever to get the boss gone. Getting materials is so hard I can‚Äôt even level up without having the mobs being a higher lvl than me. Second, it‚Äôs so hard to do a story and world quest because all the jobs to get rid of the mobs are hard because they‚Äôre a higher lvl, like I can‚Äôt even finish one story quest or even archon quest without having to quit them because they‚Äôre just that hard, and it takes the fun out of it. I may sound like I‚Äôm complaining but even my friends agree, and it just brings our mood down. I do enjoy the stories but get upset because I have to quit them just because I‚Äôm not able to remove a mob. I still enjoy each day and still have fun on it because of small little jobs to do, but even they are sometimes hard. I still do enjoy I like the character designs, and the elements and can‚Äôt wait till more new things, more characters, more places. But those are the main problems for me.",4
"Yeah so please ignore the fact that this is SUPER short. I wrote a whole essay then my computer had the AUDACITY to glitch out and hit the cancel button.
So I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since around may of 2021. And since I started playing I‚Äôve loved it.  The reason I felt pushed to write this is because recently changed servers and started from the beginning. I had forgotten how no matter what kind of games you like Genshin will always have something for you to do. There are so many quests and things to grind. And if you don‚Äôt like grinding there‚Äôs stuff for you too. There‚Äôs so much diversity in gameplay, so many characters, and so many different places to explore. I have at least two friends who only play to take pictures of the sunsets in game for desktop backgrounds (it hysterical to watch and listen to them talk about ‚Äúfinding the perfect angle‚Äù or ‚Äúexactly which side the sun should be on‚Äù). Plus I myself have become a completely different person because of Genshin. Seeing all of these characters being themselves, and not caring about the public eye, fictional or not, made me feel more confident in myself. 
Anyway I would like to thank mihoyo for making this amazing game. And if you are contemplating downloading Genshin, don‚Äôt hesitate, I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôre gonna love it. üíó",5
"Believe the online hype‚ÄîGenshin Impact is a gem in every area you can think of, and it‚Äôs singlehandedly raised my expectations for games to the sky. I actually can‚Äôt praise this game enough. The graphics and art are the best I‚Äôve seen‚Äîbeing open world makes it even better‚Äîand the entire aesthetic down to the settings screen is super clean and pleasing to look at. Soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous as well! The characters are all so lovable (!!!) with beautiful designs. The actual gameplay is made unique and interesting by the option to have 4 party members you can switch between and an elemental reaction system (it doesn‚Äôt get boring). And aside from all that, what really surprised me was how invested I became in the story of the world. Everything is designed to add to the incredible worldbuilding, and it just creates an incredibly immersive experience. The only downsides I can think of are that it gets grind-y in late game and eats up a lot of your time (that‚Äôs an element in any RPG and to be expected) and that it takes up a huge chunk of space on your phone. Be careful about starting if you‚Äôre really busy, because the world totally sucked me in, especially since new content and events are constantly being released. :‚Äô)) All in all, please give this game a shot‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in it for everyone!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for 3 months now, and I‚Äôm AR 46, so I‚Äôd consider myself well versed with it. It has beautiful regions to explore and interesting characters to play with! I easily spend hours on it daily, and with Inazuma coming out in a few weeks, I‚Äôm very excited to keep playing! HOWEVER, this game is quite difficult to play as a mobile player. The controls themselves are not hard to maneuver, as I‚Äôm quite used to touch screen controls. The problem with this game is that it crashes very frequently. Though I have noticed the patterns on the times that it crashes, it is very bothersome and annoying as it disrupts my playing and adds up extra time on the loading screen. I still have about 10 extra GB of storage, my WiFi works perfectly fine, and my graphics settings have been set to the lowest, but every time i try to co-op domains, the game kicks me out. It‚Äôs frustrating and kind of embarrassing when you return to their world. This may be because of my own device and not the game, however crashing seems to be a frequent problem. Despite these technical issues however, I do recommend playing this game and giving it a shot! It is without a doubt one of the best ever created with so much detail and effort to make such a lively world! Thank you, Mihoyo :))",5
"I‚Äôm not the type to write a review but there are so many wonderful things about this game that I‚Äôm DYING to say. First of all the art is gorgeous and clean, not just the map but the characters too. Secondly is the music. The music was performed by an entire orchestra which really helps set the mood. In a way they‚Äôre soundtrack almost rivals some of Nintendo‚Äôs tracks. 
No matter how beautiful the art and soundtrack it needs to have good plot and gameplay to succeed. And I can say that this game does have that. The mechanics aren‚Äôt too difficult even on mobile which says a lot. Even though mobile commonly has problems like mistapping and sometimes an annoying movement system they haven‚Äôt shown up enough to damper my opinion of it. The characters are all different with unique skills and abilities which is exciting and fun. The plot is immersive and interesting. Also the grinding system of loot and resin gives the player a reason to come back. 
There are a couple problems of course such as low drop rates for artifacts and characters but that‚Äôs how gatcha games are. Also since it‚Äôs open world it takes up a LOT of space and memory. Not for older phone users thats for sure. Overall I guess one complaint is that Paimon, the sidekick, can sound kinda annoying but I switched to Japanese VA and I think that helps a lot. 
Overall 10/10 great work Mihoyo",5
"They desperately need to change the resin system.  Up to about AR 45 it might not seem like a big deal but when you get to end game content it is really frustrating to have to wait over 20hrs for about 10-20min worth of game play which is often disappointing due to the RNG system. The RNG system wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if a very large amount of resin was available or a massive cut to the cost of basically everything that costs resin. I just want to play the game and have fun rolling the RNG system for artifacts but I can‚Äôt do that cause of the resin now that I‚Äôm AR 50. If they don‚Äôt fix this soon, this incredible game is going to fizzle out. Very limited game play mixed with low rewards in the end game will be this games demise.

To Mihoyo who will probably never see this. This is bad business on your end. If someone can‚Äôt truly farm for an artifact or character/weapon experience, than why would they spend their money on a new character once they are AR 50 or higher? The process of acquiring the gear for a new character and leveling them and their gear up becomes a gigantic chore that takes away from the ability to increase any current character‚Äôs strength.
eg: I didn‚Äôt bother rolling much for Eula and multiple other‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have the resources to level them up without holding back on the character‚Äôs I need to be stronger for spiral abyss.",4
"The game starts out pretty fun, there was lots to do and I was wishing all the time because of how easy it was to get primos. But I‚Äôm AR 55 now, and I‚Äôve stopped playing for a while because the game has gotten more boring, and it‚Äôs so hard to get primo gems other than events and some of the story or world quests. I‚Äôve been keeping up with the new updates and saw that Sumeru was gonna come out. I‚Äôm Arab, and I was excited to see that it was based off of the Middle East / South Asia. But I was so disappointed to see you guys doing the same thing Aladdin did, mix up Middle Eastern and South Asian culture, there was barely any good culture representation  of South Asian / Middle Eastern. Also the biggest thing, why are all the characters pale? The Middle East is diverse and not all people from there are tan some are paler or on the darker side of the spectrum, but there was only ONE character that was only a bit tan. And none of the characters had traditional clothes, or curly hair, and there was no Arabic / Hindi dub. I also didn‚Äôt see much rep for South Asia either. And being completely honest, coming from an Arab I expected much better. I don‚Äôt Know if this is racism, or just Hoyoverse didn‚Äôt do the proper research but either way I think this should be fixed.",5
"As the title says, Genshin is a pretty unpolished game in some areas. The lack of rewards during the anniversary, the resin system, the artifice to system (which was almost seemingly implemented into the game to work against the players progress) are all evidence of a game leading to failure. Quite frankly, this game would have been dead months ago if resin wasn‚Äôt a way for mihoyo to time gate some of the game‚Äôs LITTLE content. You might be wondering how I can say that the resin is a bad system while also acknowledging that it‚Äôs what keeps the players playing, but my point is that players feel like they‚Äôre missing out opportunities to get artifacts and whatnot and that they feel that they‚Äôre actively killing their account by NOT draining their resin, so they feel forced to play to prevent that. One of the main reasons this game is still going actually is because there‚Äôs no competition for the game to compete with. Honkai? Not open world. Blue protocol? Doesn‚Äôt exist yet. Tower of fantasy? Not out yet. ZZZ? Not out yet, and even if it was it‚Äôs also CREATED AND OWNED by Hoyoverse (Honkai too.) They‚Äôre literally competing with themselves. As soon as an anime rpg open world game comes out which is very well done and isn‚Äôt plagued by the same problems Genshin is, then the game will really be hit hard player wise. It‚Äôs player return count is already dwindling every time a new update comes out. This isn‚Äôt even half of my issues with this game.",3
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game! I love the scenery and the character designs are so pretty! The combat is fun, and characters each have something unique and charming. Before downloading however, you should know that this game takes up A LOT OF SPACE. Many people are complaining about the download time and file size. Especially when downloading later along the road, the updates will pile up greatly. Make sure you have a device with lots of space for future updates. Secondly, many of you may have read about the game‚Äôs gacha system. You make ‚Äòwishes‚Äô to get new weapons and characters. When writing this review, I saw people rating this game 1 star because they spent money on the game but didn‚Äôt get the character they wanted, calling the game a scam, etc.  However, this is not true. The game is enjoyable without making any payments. I am completely f2p, and I have gotten most of the characters I wish for. I have lost 50/50 twice to Qiqi and Keqing, but I‚Äôm glad I did, because they are wonderful additions to my team. This game isn‚Äôt made for people to dump their money on getting characters. You‚Äôre supposed to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the game and story. Hopefully you don‚Äôt get swayed by bad reviews, and hopefully you enjoy Genshin Impact (:",5
"Hi! I just would like to say that this game is the most fun I‚Äôve ever had! It is engaging, enthralling, and very nice. I like the American AND the Japanese dub. Some of the VA‚Äôs you‚Äôve hired are relaxing to listen to. Especially Zhongli‚Äôs voice. But, speaking of Zhongli, I have no way to wish for the characters that I would like!! I say this because acquiring  primogems, while easy enough, just isn‚Äôt enough. I usually save up..but there‚Äôs no telling what the next character(or weapon) will be up for the wishing. When I do wish for them, I don‚Äôt get them, and only get the essence of a character or some weapons that aren‚Äôt‚Ä¶prime. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the anticipation of the wish is AMAZING and I love receiving these gifts, but as someone who has tried like, 9 times to get 5 star characters, I‚Äôve only gotten new characters 4 out of 10 times, and only one five start character. It‚Äôs just simply to hard to get  characters and nice weapons is all I‚Äôm saying. Other than that, its an amazing game, with beautiful scenery, lovely, silky voices, and an exciting and gripping plot line. But, we cant forget about the fight mechanics, and the EPIC BOSS BATTLES!  I love this game! And the characters! I am grateful for whatever comes my way. I just wish getting characters and the weapons you want were easier! Thats all from me! Bye bye!",5
"I‚Äôve never enjoyed games where you do quests and have a major storyline, but this game is SO GOOD. The stories are amazing, as are the characters, and all of it meshes together to make it an awesome game. The animation is top-notch. I was always so amazed at how they add even the smallest details, like how when you go up stairs the characters slow down. The elements the characters have adds a whole level to the game, but they didn‚Äôt copy it the way others have. Each character has a unique part of that element when they use it. The world is such an amazing place, and as you travel along, you feel like you‚Äôre actually discovering a new world. The pulling characters system is such a great idea, and while I get very frustrated if I can‚Äôt get the character I want, it‚Äôs really exciting to get it when I do. The multiplayer system is such a great option as well, and it lets you help other players or get help from people. The game being FREE is just another aspect that gets it so much support from me. While you can buy items in the shop, there‚Äôs absolutely no reason you need to buy things in the game other than to get them easier.
All in all, just play it. A lot of different people enjoy this game, and if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably considering downloading the game, so please do.",5
"I started playing this game because my wife enjoys it and wanted me to help her with some of the tougher bosses haha. Suffice to say, we‚Äôre both practically addicted at this point üòÖ this game provides hours and hours of fun, and updates regularly with new content, so theres always a reason to keep playing. I can see why people end up spending an awful lot on the gatcha mechanic, but i‚Äôve been managing just fine earning my primogems by grinding. While there is the option to spend money, this is by NO means a ‚Äòpay to win‚Äô kind of game; regardless of how many cool characters you collect, if you want to complete the story, beat tough bosses, and upgrade your fav characters and weapons, you have to actually invest your time and get good. which i appreciate! I‚Äôve been having a blast with it, and the fandom for this game (on twitter, tiktok, and tumblr especially) is very funny as well haha. if you liked breath of the wild at all, you‚Äôd probably enjoy this as well and pick it up very easily. I can see why some may think its a rip off, as a lot of the in game mechanics are VERY similar, but i will say this game has an entirely unique story, and a ton of things that make it a Very distinct game from BOTW. I would say its a game that would greatly appeal to anyone who enjoyed BOTW though, so check it out!",5
"This game is really attractive to me, especially the plot. As a plot party, whether it is the shaping of the characters in this game, the direction of the plot, the layout of the environment or the big world view, it is almost perfect for me, and the sense of substitution is also good.  Very strong, it makes me feel as if I have really entered this world, and experienced adventures with so many partners with different personalities but full of strengths and positive energy. I really hope that this game will continue to win more awards, but it is also sincere  I hope that the final ending and plot of this game can make people get what they want, and don‚Äôt create too much sadness. Maybe I invested too much, but when I think that maybe any one or even more partners who have experienced so much with me in the end will do it for ""I  My heart aches when I sacrifice my wish and protect this world.

"Genshin impact is a great game. very fun to play, engaging story, and aside from being a BoW clone it has an element of uniqueness to it. Over all a great game, but just not quite there on mobile. Has a lot of lag, but on top of that doesn‚Äôt provide the must haves for mobile gaming. The game doesn‚Äôt provide an option to rearrange ur hub layout, which is super surprising Bc this is a simple service that is provided by almost all newer mobile games. The game isn‚Äôt claw sensitive, for example if ur using an archer and you do an aimed shot, the game doesn‚Äôt allow u to hold the shoot bottom with one finger and aim with another which is really annoying. It‚Äôs not always a problem but it definitely get in the way. The game also isn‚Äôt compatible with a controller which is also surprising. It‚Äôs seems like the games has an obsolete approach to mobile gaming which is weird Bc the game legit just came out. Aside from the hiccups it‚Äôs a great game, just a way better game on every other platform. Take for example Fortnite mobile, epic was able to take the experience players had on pc and console and give it to mobile players. To the point where some mobile players were able to out preform some console players. That‚Äôs was amazing on epics part. Genshin hasn‚Äôt be able to make the game comfortable to mobile players and that why I‚Äôm giving it a 3. If this was a review on p4 I‚Äôd give it a 5. Devs not to make the game a better experience on mobile",3
"I never write reviews but this game deserves 5 stars and it especially does now that spoiled brats are rating the game 1 star just because a free game didn‚Äôt give them a tesla for anniversary. I also never spend money on games but this was the first game that made me want to spend money because it is that good and I feel like the company deserved it. You can enjoy this game entirely for free though and still get lots of cool 5 star characters and weapons. You will get tons of primogems (currency used to get the rarest weapons and characters) just by doing quests, achievements, and having fun playing the game. Gacha system aside, Genshin has stunning graphics and an even better soundtrack. They consistently release a new major update to the game every 40 days so you will never be bored. I‚Äôm still in awe that this masterpiece which is now my favorite game was free right from the beginning. Anyone complaining about anniversary rewards should remember how generous Mihoyo is already‚Ä¶ Seriously it‚Äôs a multi-platform game with free major updates every 40 days and they still give tons of primogems to us. People who compare Mihoyo to EA obviously haven‚Äôt played EA games. If they were like EA, Genshin would cost $60 and every update would be DLC instead of free AND we‚Äôd have to buy Genshin 22 for $60 the next yearüíÄ",5
"Good game but I wish Hoyoverse would add something like a market you could go to to get character ascending materials from different regions a player hasn‚Äôt reached yet. I have both Yoimiya and Sayu and I can‚Äôt level up Yoimiya past level 40 and Sayu past level 20 because I haven‚Äôt reached Inazuma yet. I think a lot of players would appreciate this if Hoyoverse added it into the game. Also if u could make the gacha system better that would be amazing. I‚Äôm adventure rank 43 and only have three five stars(besides the traveler and Aloy) and only one of them is a limited time banner. Then with Aloy it would be cool if Hoyoverse could add a exclusive area for her, since she‚Äôs kind of just there and not important to the story at all. And since Hoyoverse added Fischl to Honkai Impact maybe they could add a Honkai Impact character to Genshin. A idea I have is for a new element and weapon. If Hoyoverse was going to add new elements and weapons in. A new element could be Corruption (a element exclusive to dps characters) and a new weapon could be a Scythe because those two seem to fit well together. The corruption region could be based off of South Korea with a cyberpunky style. The last thing is that I wish you could buy stuff and customize Paimon, like how you can get new skins and gliders for characters. Also my phone is dying AND plz add more Adventure Ranks :)",4
"Genshin has been one of the best games ive played and will be for a while the fan base yeah can get a little wild at times and yeah i disagree with somethings but over all one of the best times ive had  mostly all the people ive played with were kind and the characters were great the story was amazing and i felt at ease and happy the whole way through i was an F2P and ive made it all the way to AR 56 and almost cleared spiral abyss with 35 stars the whole game was fun and i enjoyed every second

but all good things must come to an end with genshin taking up to all my storage i cant keep playing and once inazuma came it was over but the day before the update i did my last wish and tripled crowned my childe on his b-day :D but now since i dont have a pc or anything else to play genshin on i guess its over the road has ended and my time is over i would have loved to play the new update i was even saving for yoimiya but i guess its time to leave ill still stay in the fandom but never be able to play :( good bye genshin ive had my fun but goodbye i wish everyone who reads my story luck to get whatever 5* you want now or in the future goodbye take your time on everything no rush all journeys must come to an end but the memories we made along the way will stay with us till the end.. o7",5
"Hello, so um I started playing this game for a week and a half and it‚Äôs very impressive to be honest. I love everything about it although there‚Äôs not much I can say because this game is already amazing as EVER, the animations of the characters are hella awesome but problem is when it gets to the animation part it lags and slows down the animation and the voices are still going on- and when I log in and start playing for like 5 to 10 Minutes it just restarts and I‚Äôm back in my background of my device I have this problem ever since I started Genshin Impact. I‚Äôve played Honkai Impact as well but no problems with it. At the same time I‚Äôm also thinking if it‚Äôs just that something may be wrong with my device... I put it to 5 stars cause I love this game already even though it lags and crashes down for some reason I KNOW that you guys are improving everything about this game and that‚Äôs cool it‚Äôs just a bit frustrating because I kept going back and fourth log in and then out, I hope you guys can fix this problem sooner or later?.. but I‚Äôll still keep playing Genshin Impact because I have already sell my soul to it lol ( I‚Äôm not good with feedbacks but hope this explains enough of my problem, I‚Äôm sure other people are having the same experience as me as well!.. ) and so thank you for reading this.",5
"I absolutely love this game and have spent more than I would like to admit on it. It‚Äôs one of my all time favorite games. That being said this anniversary they showed up that they do not not care about their fans with the rewards they gave. Worse yet is their silence and deleting of comments they don‚Äôt like so I guess I‚Äôll give a bad review even though I love their product. in addition  they have released a character who clearly needed more time in the oven and looks like they don‚Äôt play their own game when designing. They have changed the skill descriptions after players summoned a character to fit their narrative on why it doesn‚Äôt work with certain things. In the year I have been playing endgame has been non existent and most of what you do is chores to get your meager amount of currency to get stuff and get better and better artifacts that there is nothing requiring you to be so well built . I highly recommend this game if you want a good casual phone game that can be played on other devices. That being said know this company doesn‚Äôt respect you are your time with them. They will always give you the bare minimum resource wise. I did not want to make a bad review but at this point they are not listening to their fans and actively silencing people.

Edit : they ended up giving some extra rewards so I‚Äôll give them back a couple stars",3
"This game is really addicting, and really fun to play! The graphics are absolutely wonderful, and the character‚Äôs outfits and personalities are really great too! The amount of effort put into this game is astonishing, and in my opinion the game itself has no problem to it, except for the fact that it does take up a lot of storage, but that isn‚Äôt something that could be helped, and in my opinion it was worth it. I really love how the game is actually playable even if we don‚Äôt pay money, since in some games, we might have to pay money to unlock some things, but we don't necessarily need money in this game to get a lot of characters, since the game already gave many ways to earn primo gems! I was also looking over the 1 star ratings, and I thought that they were all ridiculous, with most of them just asking for a certain character. I do think that it would be great if MiHoyo can make some clarifications if there is a ‚Äúcanon‚Äù MC, since there has been a few people who think that Aether is the canon MC, while others believe that there is no canon MC. It would be great if we can actually get a response from the developers about this situation instead of people continuously debating on the canon MC. Anyway, thank you for you time reading this review, have a wonderful day/night!",5
"Pros: The game is beautiful with amazing graphics, exploration, music and unique characters. The storyline is interesting and (mostly) well-written, and higher-rarity characters are not 100% required to finish everything in the game. It has simple mechanics and interface, meaning that even if you don‚Äôt normally play video games, you can still pick up on what to do pretty quickly. There is plenty of content for you to do when you *first* start. Will keep you entertained for hours, days, weeks, months, maybe years.

 Cons: you get burnt out a while after finishing the storyline and some farming for your characters. Artifact system has WAY too much RNG which is one of if not the system that burns players out most. Events are limited and once they go away, the important lore (and rewards) go away as well. Endgame is basically nonexistent. Little to no interaction with playerbase; company is very greedy. Extremely expensive (although that‚Äôs not a surprise). Characters are region locked, making Inazuman (and potentially others) characters inaccessible to new players who might have obtained them. Diversity is lacking and one character (Dori) is *possibly* orientalist.

 Overall, very beautiful and entertaining game. However, there are quite a few things that could improve it to make it even better.",4
"I was on the fense about getting this game for a while until finally I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly impressed to find out that not only were their advertisements true to the actual game (as most others simply lie), but the gameplay itself feels fully fledged. This is the sort of game you‚Äôd expect from a console, and I gotta say it‚Äôs nice to see the effort that went into this. The combat style is engaging and fun. I also love that while it sticks to the familiar mobile trend of having in-app purchases, the game itself was free and my experience has thus far not been dampened despite the fact that I have not spend a single penny on it. It has given me little need to do so, and that‚Äôs awesome. I must also note that I am playing this on a more powerful phone as I understand that others have complained about lag, and I don‚Äôt blame them, this game file is HUGE, but is you are fortunate enough to experience a lag-free gameplay, (if not something close to it) then it really is beautiful. As mentioned before, the advertisements you see about this game are true. I loved hearing the side stories of the characters, as well as their own tutorials on how to use them. Very well done. I hope they stay true to this for the times ahead.

Also, Paimon is adorable and NOT food!üòú (To each their ownüòâ)",5
"This game plays like a Breath of the Wild clone with completely optional gatcha elements. The fact that you can have a party of four, with each member having unique elemental skills and weapons specialties for whatever puzzles and enemies come your way. Plus the story of finding your lost twin and learning about the seven Archons is really engaging. And while the game‚Äôs PS4 counterpart lacks cross-save compatibility, it might prove useful to content creators who wish to do a Let‚Äôs Play of Genshin Impact.

That said, I gave this game four stars. The reason for this isn‚Äôt because of some minor glitches that allow items to just float in midair (like what happened to me lol), but because of overheating issues on my IPhone SE Second Generation and the amount of battery life it siphons compared to some of my other apps. For mobile users such as myself, this game could definitely use a Battery Saver feature in the options menu. Could help with the battery issues, especially since once it overheats to a certain extent, the phone can lose charge... while it‚Äôs charging.

Thank you for your time reading this, looking forward to more story content, and while I wouldn‚Äôt use the possible controller compatibility feature, I‚Äôm sure others would look forward to that. I hope you take this constructive criticism and implement it into future updates",4
"I know that title sounds very questionable, but this game is amazing. Firstly, it‚Äôs free to play which is really shocking because the graphics, character designs, and overall how nicely the game runs is excellent quality. For BotW I had to pay $60 and didn‚Äôt even play for more than 2 hours, but Genshin Impact is completely free! Paying for primogems is completely optional and doesn‚Äôt effect gameplay at all. Second, the storyline is very intriguing. Some may argue that once you get to high Adventure Ranks and wait for the story to be updated it can be boring, I disagree. There are plenty of commissions and quests to keep you entertained. Plus, there are domains, bosses, spiral abyss, and events! Another thing is the characters. Each character is unique, has a fantastic design, and interesting gameplay. Seeing a character in a quest has me saving primogems for their banner every time! Speaking of design, Teyvat is such a large and beautiful world. Sometimes I just walk around and take it the sights. The songs, the view, it can be an action packed liar or a tranquil mountain. In conclusion, Genshin Impact is definitely worth the download and it‚Äôs completely free, in fact it‚Äôs probably one of the best games out there and my personal favorite. Download Genshin Impact, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.",5
"When I first saw the game, I thought I‚Äôd be able to customize my character in similar ways to other games I‚Äôd played (changing physical appearance, ability, etc.); yet as I played the game, I found myself still enjoying it despite not having this ability. The story, animation style, battle tactics, monsters, and characters are all lovable and delightful! It feels like being in a movie or playing one of my Xbox games. Really well done to the creators. So far, my favorite character is Lisa for both her charm and powerful lighting strikes during combat. Keep up the great work! I would like to suggest the ability to possibly change clothing on characters as well so that it feels more personalized if that‚Äôs alright. One downside I will note is having to walk everywhere and how gliding takes up physical energy. I can understand swimming and such, but gliding? Yeah right. Anyway, walking around to different locations without having something shoot at or lunge at you is a bit much. Overall, I still enjoy it despite the walking aspects. Perhaps you guys could create different elemental mounts? Like not your traditional horses and stuff. I‚Äôm talking about like birds, lions, or unique creatures like that. Again, I‚Äôm no game designer and I figure they don‚Äôt want to hear my peas and cues, but just food for thought. Still love the game and the graphics. Well done!",4
"Dear developers, I‚Äôd like to start by thanking you for such an amazing game. I‚Äôve learnt a lot of things in the game, the culture, traditions and style of each regions which represent specific locations in the world, my english dictionary has grown quite a lot, as well as Japanese. I‚Äôve learnt a lot about other peoples‚Äô troubles and how everyone solves their problems so I can use the knowledge in real life. The game also makes my day, it brings joy to me everytime I start my computes or phone and I see the Genshin icon. So again, thank you for the delightful experience.üíû

On the other hand tho, as you‚Äôve already seen from the other reviews and considering your 4.4 star rating (which will likely change depending on your next anniversary rewards), you most definitely have to bump up the amount of rewards we receive, especially Primogems. Its extremely hard to defeat some bosses to gain certain materials for some people, and by giving us more Primogems, we‚Äôll be able to receive more characters and beat enemies and monsters rather more easily, which is also good for you because people might stress about it, get angry and leave a bad review, and even quit. 

Thank you for reading, please take the last recommendation into consideration, thank you.üíû",5
"Amazing game! Started playing just a few weeks ago and it is very addicting! I am almost overwhelmed with the amount of content and things for me to do! The art and graphics are absolutely breathtaking and the combat and gameplay are for the most part exciting and fun. Sure, the gacha drop-rates are not the best, but there are certain guarantees so it‚Äôs still very possible to get good drops with enough time and work. Recently, people have been bombarding the game with poor reviews due to the 1st Anniversary events that are going on right now; the rewards they are offering are apparently not living up to fans‚Äô high expectations. They are offering 10 free wishes as log-in rewards as well as a festival event where you can track down chests and defeat monsters in order to obtain a good number of primogems and items. In addition, they recently sent the first of four thank you messages to all players that came with a sizable 400 primogems and a new glider skin. Still, many fans are not happy with their rewards and have resorted to writing bad reviews of the game, which is just immature and wrong. I personally stand by miHoYo‚Äôs rewards‚Äîit‚Äôs their game and they are free to do what they want with it‚Ä¶we should be grateful to have gotten the rewards we did!",5
I don‚Äôt know why people are eating this game 1 star‚Ä¶it‚Äôs honestly an amazing role playing game- the graphics are to die for. The animation is clean. The details to character design and animation are so eye catching! The stories are creative and unique and every character has their own amazing story quest! All though everything needs it fixes I have 1 or 2- first in the beginning I had a hard time figuring out what artifacts and what weapons I should give my characters because I didn‚Äôt understand what ‚ÄúDmg‚Äù ‚Äúcrit‚Äù and any of that stuff meant- so maybe a quick option in the corner to tell you how they work would be awsome! And if there already is one maybe make it more obvious! I‚Äôve been playing the game for a year and I‚Äôm still stumped on this part of the game! Second‚Ä¶I feel really disappointed when I spend all my time farming primos for a character and don‚Äôt get the 5 star I want- I feel that there is no fix to this but I‚Äôm really really really hoping for venti this banner and I‚Äôm not aloud to spend money on games‚Ä¶so maybe more re-runs? Or make 50/50‚Äôs more easy to obtain a character because for people who can‚Äôt spend money in the game it‚Äôs really hard to get 5 stars and make a good team! So that‚Äôs my only request!,5
"This is one of the best games I have ever played, mobile or otherwise. The game is beautiful, the music is spectacular, the acting is decent, the game has interesting systems and mechanics, has interesting and highly customizable equipment/stats and has a great curve for learning to build and balance a party. The exploration is amazing and rewards you for paying attention to your surroundings. Sometimes the tangible rewards are lacking in uniqueness, but the feeling of solving the puzzle or finding a random boss fight is great. I hope for true boss encounters in the future and larger dungeons, but this is a game I will be coming back to for years.
The whole story can be beaten with free characters and items, and a decent amount of premium currency is given for playing the game to allow you to acquire a few more characters. If you want to get into the optional content most is possible for free, but paying allows you to have more fun and a more tailored party with better synergy. Seeing my first 5-star character‚Äôs ultimate ability for the first time was amazing. It felt like I was setting the whole battlefield on fire. That said, it is a long and involved game and can feel somewhat daunting. It is mostly single player and I really wish multiplayer was in a better place, because my friends really just wanted co-op.",5
"People are calling this game ‚Äúanime Legend of Zelda,‚Äù which is pretty much true. It is so fantastic and honestly I‚Äôm so in love with it. The storyline, combat, graphics, everything is great! The fact that you can switch characters to fight certain elements is something that I really like, especially with the really amazing voice acting that comes with it. I haven‚Äôt been this invested in a game in a while and I‚Äôm ready to play it through and through. I haven‚Äôt found any glitches yet so far so that‚Äôs Great!
     One thing I will say, though, is that I really am excited for this to come out on Xbox and the Nintendo Switch. I kind of hope it could come out on Mac but Mac has been kind of complicated recently and various games have been becoming incompatible with it due to new updates. I also would love it if mounts were a thing. Even if horses can‚Äôt be programmed into the game, at least a hoverboard or something that goes equally as fast as the running speed. This game, I understand, just got released so there‚Äôs still obviously more things to do, so I can‚Äôt wait to see what more there is to come! I love everything about this game, I forgot to say how glorious the music is, too, and I‚Äôm just honestly amazed. Anyways, weeb/geek rant over. I‚Äôm just too happy with this game.",5
"The game starts pretty easy but gets incredibly harder as it updates, i started without knowing anything about it and didn‚Äôt know how to make characters stronger besides leveling them up and leveling the weapons up. I would‚Äôve liked a warning about how annoying it is to make characters stronger but it was my fault for not doing research. For an anime game that profits off of visuals when it comes to scenery and characters the scenery is done really well but the characters lack a bit of diversity and seem to follow only 5 different formats wich is small girl, medium girl, medium guy, tall girl, tall guy. And although I love it I wish it was at least even. It seem a lot of people are mad because of how non diverse it is when it comes to poc. I think they should remember that this is just a game. And although it‚Äôs based on real places it doesn‚Äôt owe anything to anyone. It‚Äôs supposed to be a different world so obviously it‚Äôs mechanics are different. We will probably get more poc but i think people are taking things too serious for a game. And if they just carelessly make poc it would make even more people mad. You guys should remember it is a game that‚Äôs meant to be fun and getting all serious about representation might make the represent us bad instead of doing it carefully",5
"The game itself is absolutely amazing. Good combat and what not, but the business practices are outright horrendous. It‚Äôs not bad because it‚Äôs a Gacha game, that in it of itself is loot box territory but it‚Äôs the fact that the company outright refuses to listen to community feedback. They make it almost impossible to truly have the most fun without spending money. Not only that but, rewards for very big events are laughably inconsiderate. Take the anniversary situation for example, you can only get anything truly worthwhile if you‚Äôre an artist or content creator, well newsflash not everyone is. And even then your chances of actually getting anything are still statistically almost 0%. I don‚Äôt understand what their aversion to giving the community literally anything is. They have never really given the community as a whole anything that great. It even lures you into thinking you‚Äôll get something cool in your birthday only to find that when that day comes you get a cake that really doesn‚Äôt actually do anything. Like I get it you have to make money so you can‚Äôt constantly give away free stuff, but every once in a while wouldn‚Äôt hurt you‚Äôve made billions already. I have had this game since it launched and never have I seen them do anything really all that good for the community, in respect to events or anything, in fact most events are also community run, they don‚Äôt actually do anything!!! It is extremely frustrating!",2
"I love everything from, the story, the enemies, the music, and the abilities. It‚Äôs all amazing. I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for a while now and have been amazed at the story and how the characters look. The scenery is also beautiful. There is so much content for new players and vets. This game has kept me entertained during the boring days and always connects me with kind people. I finally am going to get Kazuha after a long year and am so happy. The pity system is fair and there are many opportunities to get primos. The game is so well made with its giant world to explore and amazing character designs. The abilities are very versatile and would fit anyone wants. I overall recommend this game to anyone interested. I doubt you would regret it! 
-I notice that many new players go for characters that are said to be super strong but you should go for a character that you find fun and enjoy playing. Getting a meta character is good for damage but can get boring if it isn‚Äôt your play style. Go for whatever character you want but always do the trials first to see if you really want them. -One think I would like Hoyoverse to add is a artifact load out that can save what artifacts you use for a character and can easily be equipped.",5
"This game is great. The story, the visuals, the characters, the voice acting everything having to do with the actual gameplay is amazing and I love it so much. But‚Ä¶ there is a huge flaw that come with this game and that is that it takes up a massive amount of space on what ever device you are playing on especially for Mobil players. I actually can‚Äôt fathom how people are able to consistently play this game on mobil without having to delete every other app on their phone or other Mobil device. The game itself as listed in the description only takes up like 3.7 GB of storage but once downloaded you need another probably‚Ä¶.. 10 - 15 GB for the documents and data and even if you have that much space with every game update (that comes every 1-2 months) you need to download more data consisting of like another 3 GB each update. (All of this info pertains to Mobil but my friend downloaded it on PS4 and it was 90GB of data). Another thing is that if you don‚Äôt update the game you can‚Äôt play at all, it locks you out until you have enough room to update because most of the updates are story based and keep you moving on in the game. I really wish it it wasn‚Äôt such a huge game, I mean I understand why, but I actually can‚Äôt play because there just isn‚Äôt enough room on my iPad to keep updating even with almost EVERY SINGLE APP deleted.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing since the start of 2022, I absolutely love the characters her, the world of teyvat and the lore in this game but sometimes it really bothered me how they weren‚Äôt even trying to make a dark skin toned character for the released region of Sumeru. Sumeru is basked on Middle eastern, Soutth Asian and Northern African cultures. Though they ‚Äútried‚Äù to make some dark skin tones such as Kaeya, Xinyan, Cyno, Candace, etc. but I never feel like they are actually dark skin, I have a friend who‚Äôs skin is similar to that but was usually White other than getting herself tanned slightly. I come from an SE Asian and the inaccuracy in the skin tones are really not it for me. The game itself gets very boring as time to time. All I do now is do my daily commissions and log off. But I rarely do that now since I‚Äôve lost interest. There‚Äôs no point in playing unless you have characters that does 10x the damages. Whenever I was gonna work on my account, I was usually not on the day to farm for the talents, etc. The domains thing with the day limit really annoys me, but maybe it‚Äôs just me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love the game but I don‚Äôt usually plays it anymore due to the lack of excitement, I love the characters and the lore like I have said. It‚Äôs pretty exciting to play when you are an early player so I do recommend you playing! 3/5 stars for me due to the racism and the lack of excitement.",3
"I'm starting this off saying 4 stars because although i play on pc and never have storage issues, i do know when i use my phone it lags so hard my phone literally glitches. Other than that it's insanely good. Mihoyo/Hoyoverse had done so much with the storyline and the cutscenes and graphics are absolutely insane. The storyline gets me everytime. It's immersive. I go into every patch update thinking, ""ah okay i'll play for an hour or two just to get the new island unlocked"". Suddenly it's 5am.! There is just so so so much to do it's amazing. I've been playing since patch 1.5 (AR57), as of writing this we're in patch 2.5 and this game has grown so much. I don't think newer players will ever get bored. 8/10 in my book. Well you might ask, ""why not a 10/10.?"" well for one the storage issue but also the lack of primogem sources. I pay into this game a lot so i personally don't care but for f2p and low spenders it makes it incredibly hard to get good units, including 5 stars and sig weapons. Other than that I love this game. I've been playing for almost a year and i do not regret it. If you're looking for a fun, immersive, game that will lock you in, PLAY GENSHIN IMPACT. and if you EVER struggle.. well that's what co-op and endgame players like me are there for. Step into the vast world of Teyvat and have some fun.!",4
"This is by far the best game I have on my device. And I play it all the time! The creators certainly were not lazy when it comes to building the world and the characters, and making them believable. One of my favorite things about this game is just how much stuff you have to do! Unlike other games where you only have one main quest to do this one gives you several! So if you don‚Äôt have a Hugh enough level or adventure rank to do a certain quest there are several different things you can do, to pass the time. Also all of the characters, feel believable, and none of the plot feels forced. Also some of the food seems like it would be so delicious that I want to try it in real life! Also all the different monsters, mini bosses, and bosses are so creative that it actually feels like something that would be real in a different world. Also I really like how the game doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell you everything so you have to figure out some stuff. Honestly I tried to think of anything bad about this game but I couldn‚Äôt find anything that wasn‚Äôt extremely minor. In conclusion I swear this game is the new ‚ÄúLegend Of Zelda‚Äù of our time and will be just as famous! And would recommend getting this if you like fantasy story games!",5
"To be completely honest, I absolutely love this game in so many different ways! I feel like Genshin Impact has such an amazing story line and plot that fits along with every aspect. I love the top-notch graphics and scenery which creates such beautiful visuals that really brings the entire game to a thriving life‚Äî Not only does the outstanding graphics impress me, but the background sound effects and voice lines are also extremely beautiful! The characters are also highly detailed with different features that distinguishes them each, I even adore that each character has their own story and background to which shaped them to who they are present. Totally recommend this game if you want to play an RPG game with engaging fighting scenes and stunning scenery. Not only just the sceneries I suggest, but also the story lines and the lore all behind it, almost every quest and plot connects to the unraveling mysteries that lie within Teyvat! That is what really makes Genshin Impact such an engaging game that keeps you occupied in your journey through a vast‚Äî and stunning world that will take you everywhere.

Barely any mistakes or imperfections I see within the game. If you seem interested, please give it a shot and experience the artistic and magnificent world of Teyvat!",5
"I am redoing my review because it‚Äôs been months since I started, a recommendation in itself. The graphics are stunning, the fighting is lots of fun, but progress is slow. It takes time to grow and level. The world rank which increases as you progress is a great idea as it keeps it the fights challenging. The teapot house is incredible. I wish you could fit a little more in it but it‚Äôs really fun to experiment with and so nice to have parts of the game that can provide a little break from combat.. It‚Äôs also really nice to have parts of it that are useful like crafting and forging. I hope you will keep adding to the utility of it.I think it would be neat if you had some training features. Overall I probably wouldn‚Äôt change much about the game except I would make the drops a bit richer and I would improve the teapot editor. It can be very frustrating especially when you are dealing with floating elements. Also a lock feature would be helpful. I haven‚Äôt done much in the way of events yet, but hoping to do more. Btw, the loads allowed aren‚Äôt nearly enough in many cases in your realm. On autumnhold peak, you have multiple sections. I get one laid out and I can‚Äôt use the others. Things like fences should take up less.",5
"Absolutely beautiful! The scenery of the open world is breathtaking. When accompanied with brilliantly written soundtracks, the scenery is basically given life! Majestic mountains and waterfalls, lively villages are all results of careful pairing between the soundtracks and design. Even if you aren‚Äôt too keen on fighting enemies, just running along in the open world and exploring is a pleasure. The exploration portion of the game is well thought out too. There are many puzzles to solves, getting surprised with the weird locations at which they place treasure chests, and world quests with great backstories. The backstories are also well written, many providing players with reasons to look back and experience it again. I really have to give the designers of the characters a hands down, the designs are top notch. The voice actors are chosen well and the background of the characters really breathes life into them. There are many reasons to love (or hate in some cases üòÇ) each character. The fighting mechanisms should be relatively easy for players to get used to. I enjoyed fighting certain enemies and how certain characters really enhance or diversify my play style, although some enemies are downright scary or annoying (I‚Äôm looking at you dendro slime!). Overall, the game is truly fascinating and should be given a try!",5
"I really love this game but sometimes I kinda feel a little bad about some people complaining about the drop rates. I agree that this game is an amazing game for a free one. Which I think would probably make it one of the best mobile games. Although this is kinda of a complaint, this doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt like the game. You should keep in mind that a lot of games have flaws and I know people are always trying to fix them. Since there will be a lot more regions and places to explore, you would probably need better characters and equipment right? Since the game will get a whole lot harder in the future (and have a ton of more content), I feel like increasing drop rates or adding things for f2p people who don‚Äôt want to put money in the game. I‚Äôve been playing since the release and even though I don‚Äôt always play, I‚Äôve only gotten a 5 star character and sword. And I have only spent my primo gems on summoning which I think is saying something. I do know that 5 star characters and weapons aren‚Äôt always the best but usually, they have good base stats and abilities. I do like using 4 star characters though. Although, keep in mind that this issue will probably be resolved in the future because there will probably be more chances to get better characters and weapons and 4 stars aren‚Äôt all that bad anyways.",4
"Hello I‚Äôm gonna start this off by saying this game is great, I absolutely love the graphics and the work you put into all the characters, bosses, etc. But there is a few problems I do have with the game, past AR 45 (leveling system that they use for the game) has not much content other then waiting for new characters and quests to come out, mostly while we wait all we really have is collecting all the oculi (used for leveling up statues of the seven) and chests which really isn‚Äôt that fun to do. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong this is a great game and the graphics are amazing and all around is a pretty good game yet the game lacks content after you reach AR 45 and above once you add more regions though then the game will be more fun and interactive out of the 356 days I‚Äôve had this game I truly enjoyed every minute of it. Overall great game, few flaws, also if your expecting me to bash them over the anniversary rewards that‚Äôs no way to get what you want and if I‚Äôm gonna be honest getting a free 5 star (typically the best characters) takes the joy of getting it away if you already know your gonna get it. Have a wonderful day developers and anyone who‚Äôs reading this and continue making this game a wonderful experience thank you!",5
"First of all, I just want to say that this game is a true work of art! The characters have great diverse personalities, the graphics are absolutely stunning, the story line and all the other leveling and adventures and or quests are all genius. miHoYo should be very proud of the work they did on this game, because it‚Äôs amazing. However, there are two things that I don‚Äôt like. First, the download. It takes A WHILE. If u are reading these, and are thinking ‚Äúmy games taking a while....‚Äù it‚Äôs not just you. The game is SO content packed that  it takes so long to download. Then, there‚Äôs the in game download. This may occur only in certain devices, but the second download takes a while too. IMPORTANT- if the second download keeps stopping and throwing you out, it may give you a notice that you do not have enough device storage space. That happened to me when i tried getting this on my chrome book. The final thing that bugs me a bit is the difficulty of certain things. Like, it‚Äôs SOOOOO hard to get a five star. And some quests are a bit more challenging and annoying then others.. so watch out. 

Anyways, even with the negativities, this addictive game is worth every minute! Again, AMAZING game! Absolute genius! Ty for reading! Have fun!",5
"Tl:dr Beautiful game but sucky leveling system and impossible special items.

So I downloaded this game because I‚Äôd heard and seen so many good things about it. The graphics, open world and storyline are absolutely stunning. But the storyline came at a huge time expense. Complete the first chapter by level 3? Can‚Äôt proceed in the story till level 5. Finished chapter 2 by level 8? Sorry can‚Äôt continue till level 11. And believe me when I say the leveling system is slower than cold molasses. It took me literally 3 weeks of clearing daily quests and side quests before I could finish chapter 2. And another 4 weeks before I could finish chapter 3. Then there‚Äôs the issue of the character and weapon enhancing system. After a certain point weapons and characters need special items in order to continue advancing in power. Well let me tell you after searching and unlocking the current entire map (at the time anyway) and trading with people and crafting and going to the in game shops that exchanged special items for the items you needed I could not get my characters/weapons to progress any further to the point where I kept dying every 2 seconds. If you‚Äôre willing to put these things aside for the story and graphics then be my guest. But most people don‚Äôt have the patience to sit there and grind out something and get nowhere. That‚Äôs why I gave this a 3 star.",3
"I honestly love this game and the characters design and gameplay is amazing! But I honestly have a few problems, the first problem is that, getting 5 star characters seems a little bit too hard! It‚Äôs difficult to get 90 pity in 1 banner and to just loose my 50/50 to another 5 star, it hurts and I‚Äôm pretty sure other people who really want their dream character can relate. The second problem is the character designs, in my opinion I think we need more plus-sized and darker skin tone characters and sometimes I feel like the designs are stereotypical! Im really tired of mihoyo just having one different design and then they change it for something that they‚Äôre not and I‚Äôve heard a lot of people saying ganyus og design was plus-size and you changed it. Third problem is sometimes when your adventure rank is higher the quests get WAYYY harder then they need to! Kinda the dragonspine quest and a lot of inazuma quests and boss fights. My last problem is storage, for mobile players Genshin can take up more than 13 GB, which is a lot and I‚Äôm pretty sure Genshin is killing a lot of mobile players storage, including me. But other than that, I love this game and I cant stop playing! I hope you realize the problems soon mihoyo.",5
"Hi! You may know me as K o k I c h i or LunaMoon and yes I do play genshin all my pics are from my gameplay but let‚Äôs get onto the best things about the game, THE GRAPHICS KILL ME WITH BEAUTY ITS WAYYY BETTER THAN POK√âMON UNITE GRAPHICS
2. I love the characters and the land of teyvat every detail is the best! From the detail to the anything in teyvat and the detail on the characters detail it just- wow I never saw anything like this before! 3. Oh my lord did someone send me to heaven? Cause OH MY GOD I CAN PULL (I have a pulling addiction-) and pulling for the characters I love and being haunted by tighnari on my main account just I‚Äôm so happy! 4. THE CHAT EMOJIS- NAHH- I NEED THEM FOR OTHER GAMES I NEED ALL THE PACKS IMA FLEX THEM IN MY USERNAMES JUST THERE SO CUTE my favorites have to be the heizou kazuha (leaf kazoo) and xiao 5. Ok- i know these are complements yes but I really want to send pictures in chat like- I got funny tartaglia zhongli and lumine photos and I want to annoy the heck outa my friends with them and let them why i nearly have sanity but- I never had my own electronic sooo I don‚Äôt have a number and if I don‚Äôt- can‚Äôt send them it.. so it would be very great to have pictures allowed in chat!  Now I don‚Äôt have anything else to say but I will get more to say someday bye! And hope you have a amazing day! Sorry this is very long",5
"This game is a whole wonderland of amazing and gorgeous. The graphics are exquisite and the fact that such perfect quality graphics can run at such a high frame rate on a phone is just incredible. Truly some of the most difficult feats a game can manage, yet this one does. On the PC, the experience is even better. The soundtrack, the individuality between the characters (birthdays, names, voices, stories, etc.), the multitude of different weapons, all with different animations with different characters; it's all just so wonderful. Unfortunately, while this game is definitely a 5 star rating, in my opinion, it could use some work. Keybinds, while they're all customizable, fail to recognize mouse buttons as keys, and therefore render my mouse buttons pointless. I'd like to use those buttons, y'know. Also, I think the game could do well with more outfit choices. Currently, only Barbara and Jean have different purchasable outfits (to my knowledge), and as someone who looks forward to character customization almost as much as the whole game, I'd like a larger selection. Those are just my opinions, though! Still a beautiful game. Growing up on World of Warcraft, this game reminds me a lot of it, and that makes me like this game even more.",5
"I've searched the app store for months for an open-world game with good graphics, good characters, and fun battle mechanics, and this game comes along out of nowhere and immediately checks all of those boxes! This game is gorgeous, there's so much to do, and I ended up falling in love with each and every unique character. I have to admit, though, the chance to unlock a 5-star character is a little too low for my taste, but what makes up for it is the fact that you can play through the game without paying a cent for new characters and still have a wonderful, fun-filled experience. I also wanna note that this is a very large game that needs a lot of space and battery to run at its full potential. But I think that a few gigabytes of space is definitely worth it for this amazing title. Even if there's no enemies to defeat, I still find myself immersed, just exploring and taking in the beautiful scenery. There's even extra lore in the form of books to collect and read! The amount of content given to you at the start is incredible, especially for a free-to-play game, and new stories and characters are added regularly! In times like these, this is the perfect game to unwind with, and I can't wait to see what's in store for this game in the future!",5
I know this game is fairly new so I hope they fix this soon. This game is an amazingly fun open world experience and at the beginning and there is so much to do. But when you get to a certain point you sort of run out of things to do and you find yourself in a tedious repetition of just doing your daily commissions etc. at the ar 40 and up stage. It gets too easy in open world to the point where you are two shotting the bosses. The game encourages you to get stronger when there is no point to get stronger because you can already beat the games content. Another thing is the gap between f2p and p2w. Neither are better or worse but there is a substantial difference between the two. It costs about $300! To get 1 5 star! That‚Äôs outrageous and totally not worth it. We do need whales in the community to support the company but it‚Äôs like $20 for like 7 summons. Thankfully the game has added a lot of new content in the newest patch and those that will follow so there will be content. The biggest problem is the power creeps. Every new character is substantially stronger than the other so we are basically just wasting our money because the next character will be so much better than the last. Overall this game is very enjoyable but I want mihoyo to address these problems,4
"Ok I LOVE this game. The story is super immersive and really cool, not to mention that the gameplay its self is really enjoyable! But, it takes up sooooo much space. My device has 32 GB of storage and over half of it is dedicated to this game. I can‚Äôt update it anymore because of the sheer magnitude of every new update. And this problem is probably the only one you‚Äôll see causing significant issues if you play mobile, like me. The game runs fine, in fact, amazing for a game being played on mobile. But Unless you have loads of space, I suggest you play it on PC or console. Other then the fact I can no longer play the game unless i upgrade my storage, I 100% recommend it. Though, take my warning and don‚Äôt end up in my situation. I‚Äôve played the game on all platforms, and while mobile works best for me, PC is good to, if you know the controls. Playing it on consoles also works, and that‚Äôd be my second method to play. And once you make an account with Mihoyo you don‚Äôt have to worry about making more, since one account works for all platforms. So that‚Äôs super convenient. All in all this is more of a warning/suggestion to those who want to get this game on mobile. It works great, but make sure you have the space.",5
"I first downloaded this game bc my friends were really into it. When I first figured it out the game I thought it was hopeless. I felt that I would never get my dream characters bc it was to hard. But then I found out the best ways to get primos, and the concept of not wishing every single time I get 160 primos. Then I started finding what characters I liked and I was gonna pull for. And ofc it‚Äôs a beautiful game and then graphics are amazing. Even playing on my phone they are still amazing. Not just the characters, the quests and exploration are also super fun. I‚Äôve only been playing the game for 3 months so I‚Äôm still kinda early on. The one thing about this game that could be a problem is the amount of storage it takes up. I can‚Äôt even download it on my iPad bc it takes up 20+ gigabytes. But if u have a device where you have enough to download it, it‚Äôs totally worth it. And if u don‚Äôt like it u can just delete it and u have all ur storage back. I would also like to add that it at least for me is way less addictive then other popular video games. Now it is still addictive. But I find that I don‚Äôt feel I have to play for hours everyday. To conclude this review, I love this game a would definitely recommend it!!",5
"My game was hacked about a year ago and I was desperate in getting it back, I checked the forums and many others had the same issue, I was crushed. It seemed like there was no way of me getting my game back at all. The mistake was that I had not linked my game ID to any email‚Ä¶ so I had no way of getting it back from the hacker. HOWEVER, I got in contact with the devs by email and explained my serious situation. I proved to them who I was and that my game was with a character named ‚Äúthis‚Äù and my game ID was ‚Äúthat‚Äù, I even sent them screenshots that I had taken that had my game ID in the bottom corner! Within a few days time, I was able to get back in AND link an email! I got my game back and I am so grateful! That was in late 2021. The devs are AMAZING!
Gameplay-wise, I am IN LOVE with the characters and the story! This is by far the best game I have ever played! And I am a serious gamer, have been for years! My one wish is that I could enjoy the game on my Switch, but the mobile version is amazing, too! If you are wondering if you should get this game, STOP WONDERING and just download it! You will not regret it! And be sure to free up your schedule, you‚Äôll be obsessed with this game in no time at all! ‚ú®",5
"I think the game is super fun and in the past few weeks I‚Äôve already gotten to ar 31! I love the characters and story lines, the only complaints I have are about the gacha and the mobile app. The gacha system isn‚Äôt too bad compared to other but it definitely isn‚Äôt the best. To get a 5 star character you want is extremely hard if you don‚Äôt have luck. Having to spend money for more primo gems to get something good is inevitable. Every 90 wishes guarantees you a 5 star but that‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre wishing on the same banner. And that 5 star isn‚Äôt guaranteed to be a character. The free characters you get while playing the game are descent, but the characters obtained from wishes are definitely more desirable. The mobile app is great except occasionally it glitched and kicks me out of the game. The loading screen had been working fine until recently, whenever I try to play I have to wait on the white loading screen for about 2 minutes before actually being able to play. Which isn‚Äôt bad but it definitely isn‚Äôt practical. The other thing is when one of the story lines includes ‚Äúanimations scenes‚Äù or some bigger scenes it always glitches on my iPad. Which is such a bummer because I would love to see the beautiful scenes ü•∫. My I pad is fairly new being a gen 7 so I guess there are some glitches to be expected since it‚Äôs mobile and not a pc. But overall I love this game to death and the cute characters that come along :))",1
"I have enjoyed majority of my time playing this game, it checks all the boxes of: Puzzles, Adventure, Collecting, Dungeon Delving, Secrets, Lore, Beautiful Scenery and Characters and Art. Should you play this game? YES, it‚Äôs free‚Ä¶Unless you have a gambling problem. We all should know by now how addicting ‚ÄúGacha Games‚Äù are, you see a character/weapon you want and you try and try again rolling for them but can‚Äôt seem to get them and finally you just decide hey maybe a few more rolls will get me them if I buy more premium currency‚Ä¶and just like that you fall into a trap. But besides that, it‚Äôs like Mihoyo (game dev) keeps making the wrong decisions. Between anniversary rewards fiasco, the current fiasco (KFC glider event, just look it up) and having great in game events that are TEMPORARY even though having them permanent would have gotten them praise from the community. Then also not fixing bugged characters/content that the community has stated OVER AND OVER for them. It‚Äôs just a mess beyond other things I won‚Äôt mention‚Ä¶I‚Äôve lost faith in spending money in game.
Besides all this crap, if you can stay free 2 play, and get past the slow beginning of story and leveling adventure rank, this game is phenomenal‚Ä¶and I am sure you will love it.
P.S. do not look on social media for Genshin, there are extremely toxic people.",3
"Genshin impact is a very fun game to play at your leisure. It has everything one could ask from a game; great looking characters, exploration, monster farming, and etc.. but genshin impact struggles the most with it‚Äôs endgame content. It has already been a year and spiral abyss is the only true endgame content in the game. The game is updated every 6 weeks and there is events so it‚Äôs not totally dry. Big but though, what is the point of farming and grinding when we have nothing to test our artifacts/abilities? People will start being able to easily full star spiral abyss and then that‚Äôs basically it for endgame content. There is no reason to farm or progress any further optimizing builds and everything. The only thing that keeps this game alive is it‚Äôs consistent updates and events. If this game wasn‚Äôt updated as frequently as it is then it would‚Äôve been dead after a few months. Overall it‚Äôs a fun experience until you reach endgame and can easily clear spiral abyss. After that you will be consistently doing daily commissions and using all of your resin day by day which gets boring real fast. The events sometimes are fun but they are really hit or miss. I recommend this game to those who want to casually explore the story and contents of this beautiful game, not recommended for those looking for an endgame hard difficulty content.",3
"Let‚Äôs get this out of the way: Genshin Impact is a beautifully crafted game with obvious love and passion behind it. The stories of the characters are compelling, the soundtrack is phenomal and ethereal, and the combat is satisying and challenging at the same time. I have played this game since launch and followed its progress since beta. I will not deny that this game is great. HOWEVER. I cannot help but worry about the direction this game is going. There seems to be more interest in putting more banners out and releasing more new characters and weapons than developing the amazing the story that got experienced gacha players like me amazed in the first place. This current event, the Lantern Rite, was so hyped up and I was finally ready for more interaction with the characters and the scenery of Liyue. Instead, we got missions with NPCs and barely any interaction with the characters of Liyue. Mihoyo, this game and the combat is fun, however if there is no more content for people to enjoy then eventually they‚Äôll leave. We need replayable enjoyable content that isn‚Äôt spiral abyss, is FTP friendly, and engages the already existing characters. I really want to see this game succeed more and push the boundaries of gacha, but it will not happen if there is hardly any focus on story and character development in a game which thrived on that at launch.",4
"Hello, I‚Äôm here to deduce your questions about Genshin Impact storage! First, I recommend playing this game on a computer if possible, but if you find this circumstance that you only have a mobile device or are only willing to download on mobile, this is for you. To get straight to the point, I am both a mobile and PC player, but Genshin Impact for ME on mobile takes up 25GB and another 10GB for data that goes into ‚Äúsystem data/other.‚Äù Every update I must have atleast 5-7 GB of free storage. But for this game, If it says you don‚Äôt have enough storage for Regular Genshin which is about 2 GB, I would say have atleast 20GB. You can judge from there about how much space you need. Genshin is sometimes glitchy and it takes 20GB+ but sometimes takes 2GB. Although please don‚Äôt take any of this to be official. Circumstances may vary against others but from what I‚Äôve heard, others also have Genshin eating up their storage just like me. (And FYI, If you also find you‚Äôre battery to be going down to fast when playing genshin, set your graphics to 60 if you‚Äôre highest is 120, and 30 if you‚Äôre highest is 60 FPS, FPS takes battery life the faster the higher.) I hope this helped.",5
"A huge open world with a truly massive amount to find, deceptively-simple-yet-engrossing mechanics and gameplay, unexpectedly-high production values, beautiful graphics; the list of reasons to like this game goes on and on. Even the gacha system manages to avoid being obtrusive or even annoying, providing the player with enough in-game currency to routinely make use of gacha draws without requiring any financial investment, and unlike most gacha games the characters and items acquired through the storyline and side-quests are enough on their own not just to enjoy the game, but to thrive; the one thing that I have not seen the game provide automatically that can be considered necessary (a heavy-weapons user to break up rocks and mining deposits) can be swiftly acquired early and for free from a special, beginners-only gacha draw. Genshin Impact isn‚Äôt just good for a free-to-play game, or good for a gacha game, or good for a phone game (though it is all of these things); Genshin Impact is good by any standard.  My only regret is that I couldn‚Äôt find a way to link my account on the PS4 to the one my phone uses (the two versions of which are almost indistinguishable; no cut-rate port from more powerful machines here!).",5
"I love genshin, at this time I‚Äôve only played for a couple days but I‚Äôm alr hooked, my one Hangup was that it was so hard to get registered. Also I wish that hoyoverse would tell you when u download the app that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to access the full version with the storage you had. Thankfully now I have the app on another device that has lots of storage, the graphics are freaking amazing and even though I‚Äôm a little confused I have tutorials and my friends (who also play genshin) to ask for help. The characters and storyline is amazing, and I hope this review gets more people to play this. Because really, you dont need to be an anime nerd to absolutely love this game. One of the best (is not THE best game) I have ever played, (and I‚Äôve only played for a couple days!) the amount of detail in this game is amazing (just wanna reiterate) it‚Äôs got raw materials scattered around the environment, they even added animals, like crab and fish and other creatures that are probably made up. The music and soundtrack in this game also makes it feel like a real world! I love the camera feature too, it lets you really capture to essence of this beautiful scenery into your camera roll. -Toast_Demon",5
"To everyone who rated Genshin 1 star yesterday, I hope you know that changed literally nothing. The game does not premote pedos. Venti, for example, takes on the form of a human that is NOT a minor. The same is for ganyu and xiao. Neither of their human forms are minors. Of course, there are charecters like klee and diona, but they have nothing offensive other then their skin color. This brings me to an issue. During the recent Sumeru event, we got charecters that should have been darker-skinned. However, we got charecters like Kusanali that were whiter that chalk. Pleas make charecters have darker skin. But, its an amazing game.  To everyone saying that there is not enough content, this game was not designed for you. It was designed for people to get online to do their commissions or a bit of the archon quest during a quick break for maybe 5-10 minutes. Also, you have to take into account all of the work they usually do. This game has INSANE graphics and has mouthwatering food, a wide spread of personality through charecters, and a huge map plus a customizable teapot to build in. Plus, genshin is now giving us long awaited charecters and a entire anime. Although some things are wrong, this game is altogether an amazing platform.",5
"So, to start off, Like many other people, you should prioritize players‚Äô opinions instead of doing stuff nobody asked for. For example, many people are complaining about the resin system, though this is not much of a problem for me, it is for people with a high Adventure Rank. The banner system and story is nice and organised, but you should make it easier to get 5 stars, or atleast make a banner that in which you can only get characters, Also, The game is great but honestly, get your priorities straight, or else you might lose your mobile community. For example, most people are not gonna have enough storage space to be able to update the game once you finally finish the game. It says that the game itself is 4gb but in reality, it download over 14gb of data. You might say thats normal, You might be right, but thats an absurd amount of expectancy of determination from mobile players, people who bought 1tb of storage space on an iPhone are very lucky, but im not one of those people, also, it says that your game only supports iPhone 8 and beyond, but im on an iPhone 6s from 2015, and the game works just fine. 

Side note: i used to play on ps4, but not now.",5
"Honestly this is one of my favorite games. However I feel like there are just a couple of things that would make the overall gameplay experience a little bit better and truly get that last star for me. First day I feel like the every day bosses are too expensive to farm when compared to the need to farm other resources like talent books artifacts and weekly bosses. 
In my opinion what should be done here would be to negate the cost of every day bosses so that they‚Äôre easier to form and don‚Äôt require resin. The other thing I feel is it the wish system is also too expensive for F2P players. Most gotcha games that I‚Äôve played are not  as expensive and I find that this fact really discourages me from wishing unless I really have to. Also the whole 50-50 system and the potential to lose to another unwanted 5 star again turns me off form wishing it‚Äôs always nerve-racking to wish for thise special characters. 
I think two things here would be beneficial one if you wish and get a five star your first five star should be a character on the banner I also think that wishing costs should be cut down to 75 primo gems rather than the normal 150 I think this would promote more wishing and more opportunities to get a character",4
"I love Genshin Impact, their graphics, their gameplay, open world exploration, all of it. But every good thing has a bad side. Although Genshin has beautiful graphics, open world, etc like I said before, the file size is huge for some people. Especially mobile players such as myself. This problem isn‚Äôt only on mobile either, both mobile and pc players suffer this large file issue. And I do understand that you have to expect a large file size with this kind of open world and everything, but it makes a lot of people unable to even play the game due to its size. I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for a while so when I say I understand, trust I do. This issue has been a long while one as the files get bigger and bigger. Sooner or later if the file size isn‚Äôt reduced or somewhat compressed, a lot of Genshins mobile or pc players with low space won‚Äôt be able to keep up anymore. I myself can‚Äôt even play on certain devices due to the amount of space it takes up. I know they‚Äôve addressed this before, but especially with the Sumeru and the Sumeru Desert, the file needs to be compressed. Please address this issue as it‚Äôs causing many players issues and not being able to play. I do praise Genshin for its quality and it‚Äôs pull to keep players in, but if this is not addressed, their players will drop!",3
"The game generally will be fun for new players. Since they would have a lot of content to go through, however, as soon as you reach the end game, there is nothing to do‚Ä¶ from the company POV ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want to create stress on players‚Äù and they did that by making the game generally easy then  without adding new challenging content beside the abyss.
It seems they are targeting casual players, and that wasn‚Äôt always their vision on the game since during the first year, the game had much more fighting events, they created complicated damaging system, it‚Äôs hard to build a character, and it has a complicated RNG system for the artifacts. All that would not attract casual players. But since then they changed the game vision probably it‚Äôs a business decision ‚Äúto make more money‚Äù by  raising the middle finger for the old players who really believed on the game since it‚Äôs first days. 
In my case, I played the game two years now and It takes forever to build your characters with god tier artifact, and it takes too much money to get a signature weapon and consolations.. but after you spending all this money, time and effort. Their is no challenging content all of what i spent was pointless. 
And yeah their is a cap on the Rank last AR is 60. The stupidest idea ever‚Ä¶",4
"I really do wish I could rate this higher. First off, though, is I‚Äôll list the things I found very good. The graphics are great during game play and the storyline is interesting.

Now, sadly, the things I find lacking. I play on a first generation iPad Pro updated to iPadIS 15.0, so I would think the animated opening and cutscenes would play well. They don‚Äôt. The are s]choppy and staticky and I only get about a quarter of the animation and barely half of the dialogue and music. Second, the game controls are abysmal. Much of the time when I think I‚Äôm moving towards a navigation point, I‚Äôm moving away from it. And I don‚Äôt mean having to follow paths to get there. I mean I aim my pointer towards the waypoint, start moving and I get further away instead of closer. I have similar issues with combat, especially the magic as I‚Äôll tap the button while facing my enemies and the spell shoots off to the side. Trying to use inventory is equally laborious and nonsensical. After barely two days of trying to play and getting hopelessly lost beside a cliff face, I uninstalled the game. Which brings up one last gripe. I downloaded the app, which then needed to download a 163 megabyte patch, then an 8.6 gigabyte chunk of game data before I could even attempt to play. If other people like the game, I‚Äôm glad for them. While I like most JRPG-style games, this one, sadly, is not for me.",2
"The title says it all folks‚Äî but seriously‚Äî I was really hesitant to play when I first found out about it because it was SO popular that I was worried I wasn‚Äôt gonna like it and I‚Äôd feel bad. I finally downloaded it a two months ago as a surprise for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and I am AMAZED. Now before we get any further I have to mention that I do hyperfixate on things and that may cause me to sway in favor of the game as it is my current one. However! The game has far surpassed my expectations and is the first game I‚Äôve ever been able to play for hours on end daily without feeling burnt out and bored. The story-based fantasy concept and characters really make this game special. (I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have favorite characters) The voice acting is top notch, featuring familiar actors that make it just that much more incredible to me. The art style is fantastic and the game mechanics are so well done. Honestly‚Äî I‚Äôve gotta say‚Äî it‚Äôs my favorite game. I‚Äôve gotten so attached to the lore and the characters that it‚Äôd be very hard for me to put the game down until I‚Äôve had my fill for the day. (Plus the Hu Tao rerun has me so excited!!!) Thank you Mihoyo for making such an awesome game!!",5
"This game is great at the start since there is a ton of content to go through and fun characters to unlock/play with. However, once you start getting to late game, there is just not enough content to keep you entertained. The game becomes too easy and the only repeatable content is the spiral abyss which many players have maxed out completely. Genshin Impact simply turns into a grind. On top of this, the developers of the game do not really show any care for the players. They do not listen to them as many make great suggestions for improvement from small quality of life changes to modes that could entertain the players over a longer period of time. In addition, their lack of care has become incredibly apparent due to how they‚Äôve treated their anniversary. Genshin Impact has been game of the year, yet they don‚Äôt reward their dedicated player base appropriately (with rewards that fall significantly short of any other Gacha game). In response to this, the players have become highly disappointed/enraged and are making this very clear. However, Mihoyo has chosen to ignore everything. They remove all comments on any website mentioning the incident and have not even given any acknowledgement to the players or their feelings. This leads me to believe that there is simply no future for this game, which is quite disappointing given how well polished it is.",2
I think people forget this is a free game. There isn‚Äôt always going to be new stuff constantly. It‚Äôs the player‚Äôs fault for speed running the game. It‚Äôs continuously being updated and it has a massive road map. Complaining about finishing it all isn‚Äôt going to do anything for you. Mihoyo isn‚Äôt going to suddenly add new stuff just because you‚Äôve done everything. I agree there should be permanent mini games and such but it‚Äôs a free game you‚Äôre not going to get some amazing perfect no lag game that‚Äôs this big for free. The exploration is amazing and sometimes i just go through and walk around for fun. You don‚Äôt need to spend money to play but that is the point of the game. All gacha games are meant to be spent on. Yes there are f2p options but if it has gacha there‚Äôs an incredibly high chance that you aren‚Äôt going to get free rewards and free characters. They don‚Äôt want to give free things because that‚Äôs the point of the game. You‚Äôre supposed to save and make smart choices on who you want to roll for unless you do spend lots of money. This game is amazing and it get way too much criticism because of how greedy people are. They aren‚Äôt going to cradle you and give you prizes just for playing their game.,5
"This is by far the greatest mobile game out there, and at first I thought it was another anime game, but upon further inspection and some gameplay I‚Äôm now addicted to it, and it‚Äôs a pretty good game to be addicted to, from the high quality art and views to the rich backgrounds that make a character who they are is just mind-blowing, because the media had never seen anything like this. While playing the game though, I realized some things. If you‚Äôve played legend of Zelda breath of the wild, you‚Äôll understand, but if not, just follow along. I feel this game gives a very clear legend of Zelda breath of the wild vibe to it, because they are alike in ways like a survival game and that you loot and scavenge for materials and you can face monsters around the map, and that you can CLIMB(something you don‚Äôt see in an everyday game) swim and lots of other ways to get around the island. It‚Äôs also similar in the fact that you can glide, although it is taken a lot more seriously. Now, don‚Äôt get the wrong message, legend of Zelda breath of the wild will be a part of my childhood, so the fact that it gives me that vibe makes it so much more better. I hope that mihoyo will make lots of more games like this in the future and I wait for what‚Äôs in store!",5
"Start of the game is unique, good lore and story at the beginning getting the point of the bat easy to understand and fun to learn. It progress once you move into liyue and inazuma. Tutorial is simple and easy to understand. Each character have backstories that you can choose and voice lines you can play. Large RPG game even though it‚Äôs not finished, amazing graphics and quests. The higher AR (Adventure rank)you are the more you get and learn, fun to play with others and fun to explore around, now that I‚Äôve listed most of the good things I‚Äôve experienced here‚Äôs some of the cons, it‚Äôs extremely time consuming, the rewards are somewhat unfair in some of the events and levels. It‚Äôs extremely Pay to win too (Whaling) there‚Äôs characters that you have a chance on getting during things called Banners. There‚Äôs easy pity and hard pity, the way you can get wishes is with primogems, to acquire these you need to either explore, to missions/quest or buy them. For most people you need over 50 wishes to even have a chance for a 5 star character, 1600 primogems for 10 wishes, 160 for 1 wish. Whalers usually spend large amounts of money to get these characters to get the advantage rather normally getting them, showing them on social media to some that haven‚Äôt even been able to get them, or some that even lost the 50/50.",3
"I have been playing this beautiful open world game on my mobile phone for a while now. I love games where I can explore and this is perfect for that! I don‚Äôt have any lag issues (as long as my phone battery isn‚Äôt dying). I have heard people complain about the gachapon system, but I‚Äôve only put in a small amount of money and I‚Äôm happy with what I‚Äôve got back, you get free characters that are fun to play (my Lisa is level 70 and she‚Äôs one of my favorites), and they give out prims so that you can still use gachapon without using real money. My biggest complaint is the resource intensity, you have a team of 4 characters, you can only get their level-up-resources on certain days, and you can only dungeon run so many times a day (due to resin).  If your whole team needs the same day, it can be really difficult. And if you‚Äôre say level 50, and you get a new character, you have to get all those resources and enough in-game-currency to level up that new character before you can play it, cause if they get attacked by a level 55 monster (which is perfect for your over all level), and they‚Äôre only like level 5, they‚Äôre going to die. So I find the restrictions on resources annoying. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great game!",5
"I‚Äôve played a lot of games, and often get bored easily. but mihoyo has done it again. Honkai is a great game, but it can‚Äôt compare the the open world, free playing style of genshin. i play mobile and console and both are fantastic and besides a few harmless( and hilarious) glitches the game and its graphics are incredible. i‚Äôve been playing for about three months plus now, and i‚Äôve logged in every spare moment. I love finding the Geoculus/Anemoculus and i often find myself exploring rather than doing quests! The story itself is no slouch. I adore the way each character fits into the story somehow and manages to add to the plot of the main story. Plus the excitement of new characters/reruns every two weeks keeps you hooked! Leveling is hard when you‚Äôre a new player, but once you get to level 18-20 and you‚Äôre familiar with mechanics and artifacts‚Äîyou can‚Äôt help but fly through the levels. Besides the fear of being too under leveled in your own world, the f2p (free to play) choice and co op are so enticing that a friend of mine convinced our whole friend group to join! if you‚Äôre even considering downloading this game, you should try it out asap. you won‚Äôt regret it! (unless you fall into the hands of the gacha system;;; i‚Äôm no longer f2püò™)",5
"I‚Äôve played for about 2 hours now and I‚Äôm ready to write a review. I‚Äôve played many open world games in the past, and many have had their ups and downs. Then Genshin Impact came. Patiently day after day I would wait eagerly for the game to launch after seeing it appear on the App Store. While the download did take a little while in the beginning, the wait was more than worth it. The game is just absolutely beautiful, from the environment to the designs of the characters them selves. The game brings you in to another world full of color and adventure. The music is soothing to the ears as I walk the lands of Teyvat moving from quest to quest or finding a monster to beat. The game is smooth when it comes to combat controls and the layout of everything in general is very appealing, not like other games full to the brim with buttons and menus. This game reminds me of The Legend Of Zelda : Breath Of The Wild. (For those who have played it would see what I mean haha). The only con I can see with this game is that my phone overheats a bit. Overall I can‚Äôt wait to see what you guys have in store for us players. If you‚Äôre still reading this quit right now and get this game. You will not be disappointed. This will be quite the adventure to behold.",5
"Has anyone ever considered that the creators can‚Äôt be everywhere at once? 
I mean, seriously? Y‚Äôall are getting out of hand with these negative reviews and comments, but have you ever considered the mere sliver of a thought that they can only provide so much for us? Has anyone thought about the fact that some aspects of this game operates on luck and patience?
Has anyone else realized that they get so much at the exact same time that they can only focus on one thing at a time? They can‚Äôt be here, there and everywhere at the same second. That‚Äôs not how this works. We‚Äôd be lucky to get an aquatinted fate and 100 primos, and you guys think you deserve more just because you‚Äôve been here since the first beta‚Ä¶
I was in awe when I pulled my first 5 star, and pure luck alone got another five star off a different banner that I didn‚Äôt know I had pity for. My point is, this game revolves around patience and luck and work, not greed and gamble and anger. 
Truthfully, do it like I did. Spend a week off the game and take a deep breath if you feel entitled to more than what they‚Äôre giving, because they can only do so much, million dollar brand or not. You guys need to chill out and get over it.",5
"Iv been playing Genshin Impact since it‚Äôs first ever update. It has been a game iv enjoyed and have had fun with for a long time. I‚Äôve put money into It multiple times and have dedicated hours to playing it. One of the things that has kept me playing is the characters and beautiful world. 
However, the game has its mechanic flaws and already had a lack of representation for both skin tones and body types. But with the upcoming nation it has already made it clear that they will not be providing the same level of research, care, and representation that is present in the previous regions. The lack of representation is extremely clear now. Many many fans of the game hoped that the release of Sumeru would provide us accurate portrayals and skin tones associated with the swana region it‚Äôs based on. Instead we have been shown a jumbled mess of countries thrown together. Mondstat is based on Germany, Liyue is based on China, and Inazuma is based on Japan, why couldn‚Äôt they have picked a specific country and accurate representation for Sumeru as well? All the npcs we have seen so far in the game and through teasers are all white with no hint to any characters having a variety of skin tones. This has upset me and many fans of the game. Frustrating enough that I will no longer be spending money on this game and am considering not playing at all unless changes are made. This game is hurting many people.",1
"its a fantastic game and probably the best mobile game out there. The character design is amazing and the gameplay is fantastic. The only issue I have is that whenever I try to change my party setup it crashes EVERY TIME. This is the main reason I dont do domains as often. I wish we had a feature where we could quickly change our party without having to open the whole menu. update: with the new inazuma update, i cant even open my part without it crashing anymore... im stuck with two electro characters to fight baal with and i cant change them. please make it easier to change our party so mobile players dont crash. make the animation less complex or something. anything. Adding to this: Mihoyo is a company that dies not care for their fans. Though it is a mobile gaming company, they have made no progress towards making it easier to play on mobile. Playstation players also get no progress towards the things they have asked for. Mihoyo also seems to have forgotten their own anniversary of one year for this game. All we get is 10 wishes. thats it. With the major growth of this games fanbase, and the amount of money they make from the character banners, they have PLENTY of reason to give us better rewards.",4
"I started playing not too long ago because my siblings play a lot and introduced it to me! I‚Äôm so glad they did! The graphics is unbelievable and they update so much so you won‚Äôt always get bored a lot! Some people say it crashes ur phone or it‚Äôs too glitchy! Well..I‚Äôm on phone and it doesn‚Äôt crash for me maybe try updating or play on a newer device! The characters are so cute and the quests are so challenging but that‚Äôs what makes it fun! You can have a collection in the game or even level up your characters. It does take lots of battery but that‚Äôs a small problem. Also, it takes long to download because it‚Äôs a open world game which is so cool! My favorite character right now is Diona!! So cute!! You can also play with your friends or help each other out! What‚Äôs even better is that now you have a daily reward!! I also saw some comments on like why or how to get swords or characters, well by doing quests or commissions! You can buy wishes in the shop or get them as a reward!! By wishing you can get cool stuff and by telling if something is good they rate it off by stars. Like some of the characters are 5 stars for example. (But they are really hard to get) I hope this review was helpful! Stay safe!",5
"This game is not just a fight n' grind simulator, no, it is a very special game to me because ilit has everything i need. this is an ongoing/indevelopment game that gets better and better by almost every day. It has new and exciting events almost every week and most importantly: this game can be played without paying even a single dollar. yes this game is for free and the thing that got me all over this masterpiece is that this game has very caring developers who do all they can to make u feel comfortable by playing their creation. their live is not only shown by updating the game and giving us events. they express their grattitude and thanksgivin to their fans and adventurers openly by making videos events and etc.
to be honest i wasn't going to write anyhing about this game, i was just going to play like i always do but the thing that changed my mind was a simple letter from the developers thanking their players just because. YES they gave us rewards just for playong this game and this is why i love it. not because of the rewards, but because of the people who show their grattitude to us and i wanna do something to pay them back. hope tou will like this game too. Love you Genshin and Love you Mihoyo <3.",5
"Even tho I just started a few months ago I worked hard to level up to play with my friends and that was challenging obviously and then when I was playing with other people I wanted to change my character and there were four other people and I couldn‚Äôt see my character on the side where it‚Äôs supposed to be and I was kinda annoyed 
My second thing is about the wishes i know a lot of ppl write about this but I feel like it gets harder the higher adventure rank you have and I get pretty annoyed by this because I have multiple weapons I don‚Äôt need and I save up for weeks and get weapons and I feel really angry by this so if possible there should be a way for it not to be different for each adventure rank 
My third thing to say is that I don‚Äôt know why but i feel pimon (sorry idk how to spell it) should be obtainable because she seems like the type of character who would be useful in dogens (helpüò≠) and seems like the water type character or maybe there would be other characters like her because it doesn‚Äôt make that much sense to me why she‚Äôs there she doesn‚Äôt really help that much that‚Äôs just what I think tho
That‚Äôs all I wanted to say ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤",4
"Great game, fun to play but ever since the 2.0 upgrade my game has 999 ping almost 24/7 and I have perfect WiFi connection. Y‚Äôall need to figure out how to fix the server lags because I also have a bunch of friends who are always complaining about their game lagging for no reason. Also when I have 999 ping on time trials and challenges it‚Äôs very annoying and angering when I can‚Äôt do any damage or anything yet the time trial still continues and I almost always fail them because of the lag. Also, y‚Äôall need to add more content more frequently. It gets annoying and boring when I finish quests and all I can do for the next month or so is just farm‚Ä¶again very very annoying. Last issue I wanna rant about‚Ä¶is obtaining new characters and weapons, it‚Äôs kind of unfair how you guys barely give away primo gems anymore like you do when a new player joins. It‚Äôs very hard and time consuming trying to get enough primo gems for certain characters and then not even getting anything good from the wishes. I just feel like y‚Äôall need to raise the rates of characters and better weapons so it‚Äôs easier for F2P players to enjoy the game more. Besides those few issues this game is great and I love playing it but the lag makes it no fun and the constant and long farming while waiting for new content is really annoying and makes me not want to play this game anymore.",2
"I preordered this game and forgot about it until it popped up after being released. I tried it out, having played many games on my phone before and didn‚Äôt expect much. I was quickly blown away by the visuals. I got into the story, which I don‚Äôt usually, and have found many ways to play the game if one objective becomes tiring.
However, there are 2 main things that I think should be kept in mind when determining if this game is right for you. The first is that this is a full fledged console game that is also on mobile. Therefor, the file size is going to be quite large. I think like, 8gbs for me currently? It being a full game on mobile also means that the controls can be difficult. I‚Äôm fine with them now, but it took a while. 
Second, keep in mind that mihoyo would like money for this game. It‚Äôs f2p, but that does come with the drawbacks of less and lower quality characters and equipment. But I play the game the explore, follow quest lines, and kind of just chill. If you‚Äôre expecting something special/new every time you play, you‚Äôll have to spend money. 
For a free game with a million things to do/ focus on/ explore, I‚Äôve had a ton of fun and been overwhelmingly impressed.

"Hi, I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since launch and I am AR58. Though there are good things about the game, the bad outweighs the good for me at this point and I am no longer enthusiastic about continuing to play. First and most important are the character designs for both the NPCs and playable characters in this new region, Sumeru. HoYoVerse is trying to expand to a global audience, yet they are still placating prejudiced and colorist views. As a result, both the Sumeru NPCs and playable characters are pale and stereotyped caricatures of people from South Asia and the Middle East. It is not respectful or thoughtful representation at all and it is deeply disappointing to see. Even if you don‚Äôt take diversity into account, many of the new character‚Äôs designs are still lazy, amateurish, and unremarkable. Besides that, the lack of endgame content for veteran players is abysmal. Outside of the new quests and exploration, there is very little and what‚Äôs there is repetitive. New players will have to slog through months of quest backlog to catch up and actually be able to level their characters, with no dialogue or cutscene skip. HoYoVerse is sending a clear message that they don‚Äôt care about global player retention or new players. They just want money from the ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù a small group of players who casually drop thousands of dollars on the game. It‚Äôs heartbreaking seeing this game take a downward turn because they just refuse to listen.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin impact for almost 2 years now. The beginning was really fun! Although completely my fault, I got so addicted to the game, I wouldn‚Äôt put it down. Within 2 weeks of playing I hit AR 30. I regret that very much. If your a new player, or just a random person looking to play this wonder of a game, take it slow, this game has content you wanna take your time on. There‚Äôs 4 regions unlocked currently with 3 more regions coming out. Take your time in this game! The pros however, amazing graphics, beautiful character designs, and REALLY GOOD open world. This was my first time playing a mobile open world game. I‚Äôve experienced games like Zelda and Pok√©mon before, but I was so surprised how well the graphics were ON my phone and iPad. From starting the game till now, honestly just walking around Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, and Sumeru is all the entertainment I need. Acting like an NPC is really fun believe it or not HAHAH. Lore wise, I enjoy most of the archon and story quest lore. However the world quests, there are some you should definitely read through, but the rest are infuriatingly long. Characters are super enjoyable, specifically the pyro and cryo characters. Overall great game!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since early 2021, and I gotta say it‚Äôs been a nice experience! If you get over ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù your characters feeling like a chore you work hard to get a character, then you gotta get a weapon, and good artifacts and level all those things then level talents and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot. And when you start to get more and more characters it becomes incredibly tedious. And the resin cap makes it impossible to get everything you need as soon as possible and that‚Äôs a bit frustrating. And then there‚Äôs the absolute lack in representation for the wide range of skin colors. I feel like at the start, when I started playing this wasn‚Äôt much of an issue. But with it being a year now and still barely any new skin tones besides snow, peach, and slight tan it‚Äôs getting annoying. I get there‚Äôs a standard in Eastern Asia surrounding skin color but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair because they have characters from different cultures then fail to represent them properly? With almost all the new semuru characters being incredibly pale despite the fact they are inspired by places like Egypt, India, Southern Africa. It‚Äôs disgusting how they make them all barely even tan and it needs to be fixed immediately. If they decide to take inspiration from these cultures for their characters, then the least they could do was give them an accurate skin color. 

Until then one star.",1
"So, new player here. I‚Äôve seen this with many other reviews in many other games, where the inexperienced players misunderstand something and they criticize the game for something that shouldn‚Äôt be criticized. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sorry if there‚Äôs any problems in this review. Anyway, I want to talk about the problems first. In the cutscenes, like the starting intro (where you explain your story to Emergency Food, aka Paimon) it was lagging like crazy. Literally every three seconds the screen would freeze, or the animation would sort-of glitch. The same thing happened when Emergency Food and I read the gliding manual that Amber gave us. I‚Äôm annoyed by this because it‚Äôs hard for me to clearly understand what exactly is going on! The audio keeps running during the freeze and then after it doesn‚Äôt match. The other thing is very small- the graphics are kinda girly... A pet peeve, if you will. I know this is your style and everything, so you shouldn‚Äôt change it. But just a little thought. Other than that, the game is great. Weapons look awesome, characters are amazing, the storyline is awesome. Progression at first is fast, and slows down after, which is a good feature to hook players at first but not make it too easy. I like this game!",5
"I love this game. However, I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed (but not surprised) with the new leaks. Much of the player-base was hoping for hoyoverse to finally give more representation to darker skin tones with sumeru, given that the region is based on the middle east, south asia, and north africa. However with all of the characters from that region that have been shown so far by hoyoverse themselves or have been shown by leakers, they are mostly extremely pale and a lot of their outfits have been said to be culturally inaccurate or offensive (ex: dori, who is a stereotype). It‚Äôs a shame that the company wishes to use these cultures but not actually put any care into respecting them and representing them like they did with inazuma and liyue. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating, especially since hoyoverse usually does not listen to their fanbase regarding improvements that could be made to the game. It‚Äôs absurd that out of the *huge* cast of characters, only two could be considered to have darker skin (and those two characters are constantly whitewashed in official art). Even then, we have not seen any characters with skin tones that are darker than those two characters. Most of the cast is extremely pale, and it‚Äôs not that there can‚Äôt be pale characters, but it‚Äôs that there is VERY little representation for darker skin tones. I hope that there will be changes, but if not I‚Äôm hesitant to continue spending any money on this game.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since January - initially drawn in by the gorgeous anime graphics, character design, and story. However, in recent months, my interest has greatly plummeted. The poor mobile optimization i could look past, as gameplay wasn‚Äôt too impacted beyond needing to re-boot after it‚Äôd crashed a few times a session. But, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where the game is unplayable - literally. This is a brand new iPad, and I can‚Äôt last 30 seconds in co-op without the game crashing. I haven‚Äôt even gotten into how stingy this whole game is. Going into domains is a massive gamble and even when you get the pieces you want (which is also absurdly pitted against you, by the way) there‚Äôs still a chance they‚Äôll roll into junk you can‚Äôt use. It used to be so exciting to do tasks and quests and receive primogems to wish, but nowadays the rewards are so minuscule (barely 1/4 what a wish costs, or less!) that it‚Äôs not even worth wasting my time on. And the anniversary rewards? This has got to be some kind of prank, right? MHY spends millions upon millions of dollars on *twitter stickers* but oohhh noooo they can‚Äôt give us more than one ten pull on an anniversary because they‚Äôll go broke :,( sniff sniff. I‚Äôm so sick of being so, so deeply disappointed over and over and over again. Be better, MHY. I‚Äôd say take a page out of DevSisters‚Äô book.",2
"there are just so many problems now that even rating this game with one star is too much. not only is there no communication from the game‚Äôs company themselves, but there is also a HUGE lack of representation within their playable characters and nps. they are building each new region to be based on these very cultural areas and refuse to even do the bare minimum of giving proper skin tones. 

more specifically with their upcoming region, sumeru. with the recent livestream showing off their architecture for sumeru, that is based off south asia and north africa, there are NO dark-skinned nps OR characters to be coming out from leaks , which proves that the game‚Äôs company do not care about them offending and disrespecting the real life people from the places they are basing their games‚Äô regions off of. the characters that we are aware of from leaks are seen to be EXTREMELY orientalist & islamphobic and goes to show that the company has no remorse for those they are profiting off of.

i‚Äôve been an active player for over a year, have given this game my own money , and for this misrepresentation to come out of this with no regards or apology or change from the company, it tells us as players that the company does not care about our concerns and judgements. it is very disappointing, but i will no longer be publicly or financially supporting this game until there are changes made and i hope others do the same",1
"So. The only problem I have with this game is the overwhelming lag that this game brings to the phone. If you guys could really fix this, I‚Äôd be very happy, cause I was Interested to see all of the amazing animations that you guys could bring to such a magnificent game as this one. Plus, it should be brought to my attention that you should get the material for wishes easier. I have been trying my hardest, but I always seem to get nothing, although I just do quests and stuff that don‚Äôt have them. (I understand that this is a very early version of the game, and your improving it.) Also, VERY. good job on the character models for this game. Honestly, this is the first ever good RPG game, making the fact that all the others were not very good, since it limits you to a lobby, not experiencing the world, and just fighting. I would also like to add, something That would improve this game a lot is if you guys had different Customizations. Like Clothes, Wing Gliders (there are 3 available so, I guess I have a wrong point there) And much more! It would seem to me so fun if there was a whole variety to this game. Also, Amazing game on the characters. I really like all of them, and I favor this game a lot. As being one of your big fans, please take these ideas into suggestion and improve the game early on! I would love to see this game being one of the most played games in the world ! ! I hope the best of luck to you guys!",1
"Y‚Äôall this game is breathtaking and so incredible. I cannot express how much I love it. I‚Äôve been playing since December of 2020 but I finally decided to write a review. The graphics are so beautiful. Like Breath of the Wild level. This game is not just a mobile game. The gameplay is so good and fun and the story is very interesting. It‚Äôs an open world exploration game so there‚Äôs lots of stuff to do. 
HOWEVER: just a quick heads up, this game comes with lots of updates as it‚Äôs an ongoing game that‚Äôs adding onto its story and game as we go. This means that it will take a good chunk of memory and that the whole map, story, and cast of characters isn‚Äôt released yet. 
Yes, there is a gacha system where you wish for more characters, but it‚Äôs not unfair to free to play players. I‚Äôm free to play and I‚Äôve gotten good characters (and even a five star one!) so you don‚Äôt need money to enjoy it. 
I love this game so, so much and it‚Äôs worth every minute of your time. I still have a hard time believing it‚Äôs free too. Not one of those ‚Äúfree to start‚Äù games where you eventually need to spend real money; this game can be played without spending a single penny the entire time.",5
"i didnt get this game originally because i heard it was pay to win which by the way is NOT true. this game is absolutely gorgeous and amazing, it combines good storytelling with adventuring and even cooking (which has very quickly become my favorite part). the game is also absolutely gorgeous on its own and the community is very kind as well! about the pay to win claims, it isnt pay to win. yes there are things you can buy with real money but its nothing you cant earn in game with just a little patience. the events are amazing and they dont hesitate to shower you in rewards for the things youve accomplished, whether it be a simple event like just giving a guy some stuff every day for rewards or an entire event including brand new lore and characters (even some map expansion as well!) they are both so entertaining and engaging. i have severe adhd so despite open world games being my favorite, they can bore me due to not having anything in them but despite this huge map it isnt always bare. there's enemies, loot, random quests, ingredients, etc. and it does wonders for my adhd. im struggling to get everything written down but...

tl;dr highly recommended, the best open world game ive ever played (also not pay to win!)",5
"I‚Äôve always put off this game and joined the Genshin-hate hivemind for YEARS, simply because it‚Äôs an anime game and the abhorrent fan base. I decided to give it an actual go and now I‚Äôm completely addicted. There‚Äôs so much to explore and the world is huge. The characters are fun and unique. Music is gorgeous and SFX are great. I‚Äôm regretting the years of irrational hatred for this game, I wish I played it sooner. I blame social media and compiling a trashy community together with a great game. I just want to play more of this. Disregard the abominable community and hate altogether. 

 I‚Äôm also surprised how humorous and safe for kids this game is as well. You could definitely play with your kids here without obnoxious fan service. Before, I assumed it had it because of the sheer amount of disgusting borderline pedophilic fan art there is. But no, the fan base does not match the game. This game is awesome. Just give it a shot.

To clarify, I mainly play on PC since there‚Äôs much more detail, graphic fidelity, better controls, etc. (Also the package is 50gb rather than 12). I highly recommend you first try Genshin on a good PC. 4K res as well, this game looks glorious even with it‚Äôs simply cel-shading.",5
"I love genshin impact so much, and the characters are amazing. However, it is not free to play. Getting primo gems is way too hard, and the amount of pity you have to work up to is insane. Even with 100 dollars, it only gets you 50 wishes. Wishes are also too expensive, 160 primos for one. Mihoyo is very stingy with the amount of primo gems in events and commissions. It‚Äôs very hard to play once you get to a higher ar. I have explored most places, and I cannot get more primo gems unless I spend money. I‚Äôve been saving for about a month and I came up with one ten pull. The amount of money needed to get five stars is insane. If you lose the 50/50 with the money you spent, you have to spend over 100 dollars to get the character you want. They should get rid of the 50/50. It just makes you mad when you lose the 50/50, and spending money twice to get the character is maddening. Another thing is that you have to buy the battle pass if you want the bottom rewards. It is very unfair, it should be unlocked. This is not a friendly game for players who can‚Äôt spend money on it. I have spent at least 800 dollars on it and have gotten some characters, but it is not worth the money. The pity scale is too high and so is the price of wishes. This is a good game, but not for you if you can‚Äôt spend money.",2
"This is the best game I have ever played. There is always something to do and countless possibilities ranging from ascending and upgrading characters to fight, to exploring the wonderful and seemingly infinite world of Teyvat. Using different elements you can fight and create teams, fighting bosses and smaller enemies as well as playing with others in co op. You unlock teleport waypoints and Statues of the Seven to move more easily across the map and just adventure through the beautiful and ethereal scenes and animation of this stunning world. The quests that you can do are also amazing, following one archon quest that follows the story of the traveler (you) and involved the intricate stories of each person there, and of the tales and creation of the 7 archons in Teyvat. The thought and creation put into each character and their voice lines and story is truly amazing, and each part of that adds to the interactiveness and the beauty of the game. While wandering through purple covered mountaintops, windy cliffs, rocky caverns with glowing tapestries across the walls, or an amazing sunset at the roof of a building, you always will find that the beauty of the game is what makes it so special and amazing.",5
"This game was proven to be the next game to reach #1 upon successful concepts in character design and uses along with regions to explore and mysteries to solve in stories. Not to mentioned weapons characters have to use and enemies & bosses to defeat. What ended up being half is often times the loading screen gets stuck after all the protocols as to downloading updated file, verification within the file and the save file being loaded and ready to go are dealt with and ready to begin play that the loading screen would reach halfway thru the earth symbol and stays there for eons to come. I did the best on my end to make sure game runs smoothly thru tablet restart, network reset and app restart, which all of them perform smoothly at the time. I would pray the game would no longer be required to go to the loading screen with the elements logo that would impose a favor of being stuck on the half earth logo again. Otherwise, game is successful in all other aspects, which certainly win me over to playing this game. By removing an requirement as that or perhaps another means of loading screen where it is different from the original, I would then be able to give praise to a game like this and be able to play once more.",3
"The only thing I have with this game is that I wish that you could change the apprentice of the first character. Like changing the eye colour, the cloths, the hair, and the skin colour. But for the other people you should be able to only change the cloths. Also I wish that you could make more wishes, to get more people and more things. Lastly I wish that there were more weathers like rain, thunder, snow, hail, and maybe storms where u have to take cover and it will destroy things. Also I think there should be an easier way to change the characters in the group like a simple button maybe I‚Äôm just blind but I don‚Äôt think it is there. Also when you play on an iPad it keeps glitching out and I have to start a lot of things over. I‚Äôm in the middle of a legal and then all of the sudden it glitches out and I have to start that little bit over. I don‚Äôt know if it is the game, or my divice, but it needs to be fixed. Also I wish that you could trade characters, protigim, wishes and more with your friends. 
Thank you for reading and I hope you make these changes!!üòé

P.S. if u want to make another character u should do some sort of mermaid and when they go into the water they change and when they get out they go legs",4
"There are a lot of problems with this game but the unfairness in and out-game that goes towards F2P and Mobile players is insane. First off we have the insane amount of space this game takes up. For it to be in the 2.1 era it takes up too much space. Another thing is how money grabbing this game is. This game is based off luck, sure but not everyone is lucky, especially me. If the gacha system works as it says to work, a player shouldn't have to reach full pity to get a single 5* character. I am also F2P so i have to miss atleast 2 banners to get a 5* that isn't even guaranteed. The new weapon system isn't even circling around F2P either, only for people who bring you money. With the events which only give you 430 primos each event, a player doesn't even get a 10 pull unless they spend zero primos for a MONTH straight. A little bit over an entire banner. Also, why does this game break so often? Every polearm in the game can get stuck on something small like a boulder in the open world. This game has so many issues but is only biased to fix the ones that affect people who pay. Weapon banner system, the ENTIRE resin system, like?? Fix your game dude like not everyone can or will spend their entire life savings on a game that barely cares about its players.",3
"As it says, yes, this game deserves 4 stars at best. Number one, the music is absolutely delightful and I genuinely appreciate how much effort was put into the music and game. Number two, the main storyline is decently good? The characters have wonderful appearances too. There‚Äôs only one problem, and everyone knows what that is, Mihoyo is not grateful enough for their fans. You‚Äôve had dedicated players for a year and made thousands of dollars‚Ä¶ and then we get‚Ä¶ pretty bad rewards that anyone could‚Äôve easily paid for. I feel like as an f2p player these rewards were meant for f2p people, there is no way people spend hundreds of dollars on this game and get 10 wishes and a couple Mora, we don‚Äôt need mora Mihoyo, I have literally 1 million mora all I want is primogems. Let‚Äôs also talk about the fact that Mihoyo gives us better rewards when they fix bugs than the anniversary rewards altogether. Primogems are SO hard to get as an f2p player and some of the things we do for just a couple of primogems is insane, especially when we get achievements and mainly only FIVE primogems for them, FIVE. Trust the community knows you guys wouldn‚Äôt lose a penny for raising the primogems we get for anything and everything.",4
"When I saw other people playing the game and say how cool everything was, how the graphics are amazing, the story is engaging, when I got the game I was excited. But when I actually opened it the screen was black. So I thought that this is just the opening screen but when I started to play, everything around me was black and I can only see a certain section of where I was. It made me really uncomfortable and I felt pain that I couldn‚Äôt play the game. I had really high hopes to be able to play it but I couldn‚Äôt. So since I wanted to play it I continued to but when I got to the part where I got sucked up in the tornado and had to fight the dragon, that‚Äôs where I gave up because my whole screen was just black and I couldn‚Äôt do anything. So when I went to the app on the App Store I saw that you would have to have the iPhone 8 or up, I got kinda mad because not everyone is able to get the newest phone. Some people don‚Äôt have that kind of money (like me). So the MAIN BIGGEST thing you can do is to let the game be playable on all mobile devices so that way everyone can be happy and play. I know this game is new and all and you guys have a lot of reviews but I think this is a main one to do or at least think about. Hope you guys see this review and react to this. üòä

Also your other game (HonkaiImpact) is REALLY good so I thought this game was gonna be good.",2
I find myself playing losing track of the time the story line keeps you wanted to play more pros they do not have a pay to win aspect you can get everything free been playing two days and I already got a 5* so don‚Äôt let the reviews say other wise yeah normally the drop rates are low but they have events that boost up to 50-75% so save and use during those like I did and the 4* characters are still just as good u want to have a variety of different squads as you progress another pro which seems to be underrated is the voice to chat with npcs I think many will agree sometimes u just wanna skip through and sometimes u don‚Äôt feel like reading not to mention you feel more immersed into the game hearving different voices as you progress with different characters the only con I really think is the no mount system while it‚Äôs still beta hope it comes in future but they‚Äôre are ways around this some characters increase your stamina for entire party so u can run longer and climb higher so they doing everything right I‚Äôm a firm believer in making a game good enough free some players choose to purchase to support versus having to purchase just to progress so this game get a a+++,5
"First of all, I‚Äôm saying the creators of this game if you don‚Äôt want to consider this then it‚Äôs OK but I‚Äôm just saying I would love it if you did first of all, I would love it if you made an abyss sibling banner second of all, I would love it if you could make an abyss sibling story quests I know why it would be hard because you can just make the same animation from traveler Lumine into abyss Lumine same with aether since they have different powers) but I would love it if you can consider it also, I would like it if you made more child boys and more children in general. They‚Äôre really cute and one more thing. I would love it if you made the traveler have more weapons like if they could switch with a statue of the seven like elements you could‚Äôve just done this up with one different element, and I would be happy.(disclaimer) if the creators of this game don‚Äôt want to consider it then that‚Äôs completely OK I‚Äôm just saying this is what I personally would like to add to the game and if they don‚Äôt wanna do it then that‚Äôs completely OK and I was still love the game just the way it is! (Thank you if you made it this far reading) üòÅ",5
"honestly, i love honkai and genshin so much. hoyoverse has given me a long term source of entertainment, and each game gives a different vibe and suits a different demographic. though genshin is a gacha, the game give you enough currency where (if you grind hard and long enough), you can get through all of the content and pick up enough limited 5 stars to do so. with that being said, there‚Äôs definitely a lot that needs improvement, such as endgame content apart from abyss and a reworked resin system. it‚Äôs so hard to improve character artifacts due to the rates, and to distribute your resin throughout all the bosses and materials on top of that is a nightmare. i also believe there should be some other way for endgame players to earn primos, as right now im in a spot where there‚Äôs no more to explore and im clearing abyss every rotation. however, seeing hoyoverses improvement with honkai, I have high hopes they will slowly make changes to benefit their players. with that being said, im in love with the coziness (at least for now TT) of the storyline and gameplay, and the landscape and designs itself are stunning. great game to pick up with summer coming up!",5
"I can say for a fact that Genshin Impact got me through quarantine. A nice, time-consuming game filled with beautiful scenery and interesting lore. The idea of the game is quite unique. If you're looking for a game to spend years on, without ever stopping, then this game is for you. Some major issues with the game is the pity system. It's not always convenient, especially when you get Qiqi on, say, Ayaka's banner. But, hey, it's a gacha game; what can you expect? I will say that this game is worth spending your money on. Though it's free to play, the quality of it is far from cheap. The music is simply amazing, and the graphics and designs are phenomenal. Hoyoverse is also not stingy with giving you rewards such as primogems and the like. Hoyo is generous with that kind of stuff, and you can expect to get thousands of primogems as a beginner from world exploration to solving puzzles and completing quests. This game will definitely be worth your time if you're looking for a good RPG game to spend your time on. Of course, if you're not looking for a time-consuming game, Genshin might not be for you. But once you join, you can really never quit, in my opinion.",5
"I started playing this game so I could join in on something my teenage daughter loves and invited me to play with her. I enjoy the game enough that I‚Äôve managed to almost catch up to her even though she had a major head start üòÖ. I love the characters, the core mechanics, and the variety in the world. I have come close to quitting a few times when the archon quest would have a challenge l couldn‚Äôt overcome and I‚Äôd get stuck for months. The anti-Raiden Shogun training being a prime example. There was no possible way to move forward in the story without completing the training, which for some reason I simply could not do for months on end. If there were alternate tactics to complete the challenge, it would have been so much better. If it weren‚Äôt for my daughter, I would have given up. 

The puzzles also bother me because there is often no way to discern the logic of the puzzle. Some of the puzzles have enough context that I can actually figure them out, and it‚Äôs very satisfying. But more often than not, I end up having to find a video tutorial that walks me through the very random answer.",5
"The feeling of opening this game for the first time and experiencing everything is not something I‚Äôve ever been able to recreate with anything else; it‚Äôs truly a one-of-a-kind experience. And, over the 6 months (ish) of playing this game daily and progressing through the story, I‚Äôve found myself wowed again and again. Seeing Liyue Harbor for the first time, going to Inazuma with Beidou and Kazuha and experiencing everything there, seeing Sangonomiya Shrine for the first time‚Ä¶ this game truly is gorgeous. The soundtrack is amazing, the characters are all very fun to play as, the story line (even with its holes and not so great moments) is better than most main-stream media I‚Äôve consumed, and the events are incredibly fun. Overall, this game has been a net positive for me (though perhaps not for my grades, lolololol). All of that being said, however, the Gacha element does hinder this game; you can complete the game without ever wishing, sure, but that does hinder your ability to complete certain aspects of the game. Also, the lack of endgame makes progressing somewhat unenjoyable, with most in-game content being delegated to limited time events.",5
"Ignore any other negative review. Yes the game takes a lot of storage, for a mobile game Genshin Impact has a HUGE amount of detail, the map is huge, and it‚Äôs overall worth it all. The story is VERY enticing. Yes, it IS a gacha game, but that doesn‚Äôt kill the fun. Yes you might miss out on a character you wanted but that‚Äôs okay. Even now as an adventure rank 57 player I still use characters that have since way fallen out of meta. It‚Äôs about strategizing, and if you can‚Äôt put just a little bit of effort into learning mechanics and team building you might be disappointed at your damage. But learning how to boost team damage and completing quests is fun. Not going to lie, the game IS a grind, but even that‚Äôs all part of genshin altogether. It might pain you at times but if you wanna deal big damage then that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll have to suffer (unless you have extreme luck lol). 

Tldr: even free to play players can enjoy the game and do well, i was free to play til Adventure rank 50 and enjoyed my time as one, im just a very low spender now and it doesn‚Äôt really change much, the game is fun regardless. Give it a shot, go in and have fun thats all. Everything Genshin has to offer is worth it.",5
"Genshin is an amazing game that I‚Äôve loved since I picked it up. The graphics are really good, even if you‚Äôre on mobile (I‚Äôm using an old iPad), the characters are likeable, and the gameplay is fun and engaging. I do have a few problems with it though. After you finish the main archon quests, the only quests left to do are world and story quests, which get tedious and boring after a while. Except for events, there‚Äôs hardly anything to do other than farm domains, and you can‚Äôt even do that after a while because of the resin limit, which, by the way, is a mechanic I really like. Using resin to limit how much farming is allowed to be done really helps players from milking everything out of the game early on. Another thing: free to play players have a hard time getting good five star characters. I found that I rarely got what I wanted when I tried to be free to play. I could hardly get to high enough pity as a f2p, and when I did I still had to gamble losing my 50/50. Even with all those things, it‚Äôs still a great game that I recommend to anyone who is willing to put time and effort in. That said, it‚Äôs fairly addicting, so make sure to manage your time right!",4
"Genshin Impact is a beautiful game made by incredibly talented artists, but your enjoyment quickly dries up when you realize how little the people in charge care about player satisfaction. I'm an AR55 player who's been playing on and off since launch, and there have been very few quality of life updates. Some character abilities work very inconsistently (ex: Xinyan's tier 3 shield and Sara's teleport both don't work as intended, both have been issues since the characters were released and have yet to be acknowledged), but only bugs that are useful or entertaining for the player get fixed (ex: Kokomi's walking on water infinitely, a fun bug that makes exploring more fun and which MiHoYo has announced plans to fix immediately, when other characters like the ones I just mentioned have literally broken abilities and MiHoYo doesn't care).

There's very little transparency with MiHoYo. They tell players basically nothing and do everything they can to sweep player complaints under the rug.

Especially with the recent decisions made by MiHoYo to be stingy with anniversary rewards, especially the meager community event rewards that are locked behind RNG and nowhere near proportional to the work many content creators put in, I can't in good faith recommend this game to anyone. Don't give this greedy company your time and energy, and most importantly do NOT give them your money.",1
"Really have been enjoying my time with this game the world is absolutely stunning, the dialogue I find to be quite humorous and the gameplay is overall really fun. I especially love the way the elements will interact with each other adding another layer of thought behind party builds. However this game is very very very very greedy surprisingly for a mostly single player rpg with very limited co-op. The rates for the gacha are actually absurd the rate for a 5* character/weapon is a measly 0.6% which would be acceptable if you didn‚Äôt have to get a character 7 times to actually fully unlock their constellations(abilities,talents, passives etc.) as well as the 0.6% being split between characters and weapons so realistically there‚Äôs a 0.3% chance of pulling a 5* character and 0.3% for a 5* weapon; so unless you have 10‚Äôs of thousands of dollars to spend on the game to actually get the characters you want your best bet is to be f2p and just go for 4* characters that way you may be able to unlock there full potential (constellations)
Hopefully that will be addressed considering the recuperated the development cost in 1 week of the game being out. If not I don‚Äôt see much longevity for this game which is a shame because it has limitless potential if the devs can see past the money bags.",3
"So, obviously this game is not finished development but I do have some things to say. This game is very fun! I like to join my friends and play together, the story of the game is also very interesting and nice. If you haven‚Äôt tried it out, you definitely should. The community has a lot of funny jokes, and are very nice, although some can be very rude or toxic. So this game is a really good game if you want a fun open-world exploring Gacha game. But, This game does not give out much rewards and there aren‚Äôt a lot of options to get the in-game Gacha currency Primo gems.  This game is free, but you will probably spend money since it is hard to get Primo gems, and if you can‚Äôt afford spending money on a game, it‚Äôs pretty hard to get good characters and weapons from the Gacha. I feel like this game should include more ways of getting Primo gems. Another thing I don‚Äôt like about this game is that if you have played for a long time and finished most of the quests, explored a lot, and leveled up a lot, then you have nothing to do. The only thing you can really do is to wait for a new update, play with friends, and help other people with stuff in Co-Op. But this game is a really good game and I'm looking forward to more.",4
"now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, i LOVE genshin. the scenery, LEGENDARY, SPECTACULAR, FLAMBOYANT!!! chefs kiss to be exact. the action and battle graphics : YES! YES AND YES! The character designing and settings? 10/10. üôå they‚Äôre extremely unique. THE PLOTLINE? GOD YES. THE LORE?????? YOU DONT UNDERSTAND HOW LIFE CHANGING IT IS. it is F2P (free to play) friendly of course, if you really get into it. it‚Äôs just that playing genshin is like taking a big risk. genshin requires quite a lot of space on pc , mobile, etc. that is not the problem. genshin impact is one of those games in which you seem to consider ‚Äúgambling‚Äù but for strengths. it‚Äôs an action but also a luck game, it requires being able to understand numbers and certain terms. also don‚Äôt explode your computer just to play this game üòÄ it happens more often than you‚Äôd think. On the bright side, there are GREAT social and interactive events in which you can be in co-op or multiplayer and interact with other players. 
also, careful with the fandom, it‚Äôs got different sides.
 either way, hoyoverse has come a long way, I‚Äôve been playing genshin since 1.3, now it‚Äôs come to 2.6, in just a short span of time, it‚Äôs began to increase WIDELY in popularity. good job, hoyoverse.",4
"I have always loved Genshin, and I was so excited for the new region of Sumeru, but I‚Äôm beyond disappointed in the designs of the upcoming characters. The lack of diversity is blatantly racist, with Sumeru being based off SWANA, the characters should NOT be as pale as they are. It is not a true representation of that region, the characters there should be a representation of the real people who live in the region Sumeru is based on, and they are not. Genshin seemed to take so much care in the representation of their Chinese and Japanese based regions, but isn‚Äôt taking the same attitude with Sumeru. It is absolutely unacceptable to use a real life region as inspiration and then refuse to give a real representation of its own people, you cannot just use bits and pieces to pick and choose to your liking.  The Sumeru characters should have darker skin tones to properly represent the people they‚Äôre inspired by. The lack of diversity has been a problem even before the announcement of the playable Sumeru characters, as even the NPCs supposed to be from Sumeru are not good representations of the people in the region they‚Äôre based on. Even within the current playable characters there is issues of racism, Kaeya and Xinyan, the only two darker skinned characters out of 50 playable characters, are commonly whitewashed in official art. Until Hoyoverse steps up and gives us the correct representation, I will no longer be financially supporting Genshin Impact.",1
"A great game that seems to be easily able to expand on content over time. The combat is extremely fun and dynamic. Finding gear for your character is random, but with it comes a great feeling when you finally get the one you want. The world is gorgeous and filled up with things to grab/fight! I give the game 4 stars because the resin/primogem system rewards you with a ton of items at the start, but takes that level of reward away over time like a shady drug dealer. The rates for characters are awful given the price point for a shot at them, especially after you‚Äôve spent money on the one time bonus gems packs. The more they add characters, the less likely you get the one that would fit perfectly in your team so that leaves me worried about the future of the game. I‚Äôm also going to be keeping a close eye on balance in the game. I want my money spent now on the game to be just as worth it if I had saved it till next year. Please value our spending on your game. I see myself having a lot more fun with the game and look forward to challenging content in the future. PLEASE INCREASE G√ÇCHA RATES AND RESIN CAP/RECHARGE. Thank you <3",5
First I really love this game but unfortunately I don't own a PC so I play Genshin Impact on my Apple iPad. Thing is it crashes way too much especially after the inazuma update. I've been trying to co-op in domains in inazuma but it crashes the minute I try to co-op. It wasn't this bad before the update and I have a few friends who play Genshin Impact mobile but they don't have any problems with crashing. Maybe it's because I'm using an Apple device but I lowered every setting in my game to prevent it from crashing even more but it still crashes. Every time the game has a survey I always keep saying to fix the crashing issues for mobile players like us cause not everyone has a PC or PlayStation to play the game on. Unfortunately nothing has been changed and I've been asking this for a long time but no one has done anything about it. I know that the Genshin Impact designers or whatever is already busy doing stuff that concerns the game but if you guys have the time please fix the crashing issue for us mobile players. It's really annoying to keep on crashing when you really enjoy the game which I really love this game but the fact it keeps on crashing even more after the update is very frustrating so please I beg you to fix it.,3
"This game is absolutely beautiful. The animators definitely spent a great deal of care and time in bringing this game to life. The aesthetics of the world and everything within is outright amazing! The characters and NPCs all are unique as well. I spent so much time just exploring the rather large area of the world right out of the gate rather than jumping into the story line. To everybody that‚Äôs thinking of doing the same, as it is quiet fun to do, I recommend at least going along and getting your wings and first couple team mates before you do begin to adventure around. Just need a few of those perks in order to complete a number of.... well I‚Äôll say encounters so as not to spoil anything. This is in my opinion the perfect open world game for mobile. But with all the praise there is also a downside; this game is an absolute monster on battery life. Make sure you have a power source nearby if you want to dive into this world. Trust me, if you start roaming around, time and battery life will go before you even realize how long it‚Äôs been. 

Would recommend the developers to include a battery icon and clock visual in game so players can monitor both as they play. Otherwise this is a perfect game to me.",5
"I have been playing this game since it came out and it has been one of the most amazing games I have played. The graphics look so good ( like you would see in anime) and you get to explore new cities, get characters ( that look so cool), began this journey where your trying to find your twin sibling ( you can choose the brother or the sister).
I was trying to find a fun and exciting game and I found out about this which I‚Äôm glad I did. When I started playing this game it was going good but I started having problems where when I have to level up my character I have to find things before I level them up ( defeating a cube, a big flower plant, ruin guards). When I try to defeat them I can‚Äôt because they would be on a higher level and I try different strategies to defeat them ( and do them over again) and I watch videos to see what other people do but when I try them it doesn‚Äôt work. This also happens when I‚Äôm trying to level up my rank ( I‚Äôm currently rank 35 and I have been stuck on it for a few months and I can‚Äôt defeat the domains) Can you please try to make the fighting easier? that would help out a lot. I still love this game thank you for making it.",4
")Disclaimer! I am a Ps4 player and have been playing for months.) This game is AMAZING, its a beautiful step into the gacha part of video games, and this game is absolutely beautiful, from the story line to the amazing graphic designs, but, there are many things that i feel must be discussed. Primogems. Primogems are a reward and common to get, but i wouldnt say their easy to get, you get them during events, from chests, in mail, and more, but these gems will mean A LOT more than they seem. Which comes up to the next thing, wishing. You need primogems to wish and this where a HUMONGOUS PROBLEM erupts with players in this game. There have been many banners with characters to wish for, and if your a desperate player with no primogems, you start to get more and more desperate for primos the shorter the time for a character, leading them to buy, buy, buy away, using their money to buy primogems just for a character they love, which can lead to much more than you would think. 

To the devs: this is an amazing game, and i have nothing to complain about, and im sure you‚Äôve got this a lot, but i feel that if you added more generosity for primos and mora the experience would be better :)

"This game is pretty good! Its fun to play with friends. Im not sure how the performance is on mobile because im a PC player, but it runs smoothly and it looks good. But there are some massive flaws with this game. As a F2P player, its very hard to get literally anything in this game. No, I don't want Lisa constellations I want a 5 star. Yes, thank you for the pity system, but its literally so hard to get a 5 star. It costs so much money/time that its honestly insane. Plus, the resin system is also like.. yk.. bad. Domains are super hard to get anything worthwhile from if you are below ar 45, and I yknow, need artifacts to get to ar 45. And I feel like the wish system is literally so biased (ik thats not how it works but like jfc), like, I'll see people who will draw 3 5 stars in one pull then 3 4 star characters. How is that fair? like the story but sometimes it gets a little confusing. And this game gets so boring after ar 40, I am aware that It's not fully released yet, but like, the only things that you are able to do is grind for artifacts in the same boring repetitive domain over and over again and then get nothing. So basically, this game is a scam. But do I care? Not really, this game is fun to play sometimes, I like the story, and it's really pretty. (It's fun to beat stuff up). Overall, I'd say if you have amazing luck, play this! Otherwise, do Not touch this game unless you want to suffer",1
"Genshin Impact is by far one of the best games I have EVER played. There‚Äôs a few minor things here and there that I would request have some work put into them such as making traveling around the world of Teyvat a bit less boring for players after hitting a certain AR, putting in an option that allows players to go back and watch all of the cutscenes including the ones from special events that they may have missed out on because of being too low level, or maybe even giving us some more original resin and freemogems to farm domains and bosses and blossoms with? Like I‚Äôve said before, this game is beautiful and amazing and absolutely my favorite game to play right now, but it‚Äôs starting to drag and get boring and I‚Äôm stuck at AR 50 because it takes forever to get your levels up once you get past AR 30-35+ and unless you spend hours upon hours upon days building almost every character you have, the ascension quests are basically impossible to beat. Hopefully MiHoyo will listen to their players‚Äô requests and pleas and somehow make at least a few of the many requests possible ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èü§ó",5
"I‚Äôve seen this game pop up quite a few times on my ads and out of curiosity gave it a go, when you run into anime games it‚Äôs common to have low expectations along with the common negative aspects of 3D Anime, but this game absolutely blew me away, the characters are loveable, goofy, and fun to interact with, the gameplay mechanics are simple yet doesn‚Äôt hand feed you the playthrough. The world building is absolutely astounding, The fact you can go to every single NPC and each one have their own stories, their own lives and original dialogue makes this world that much more immersive, I can‚Äôt imagine how much effort this team must have put into that alone. The soundtrack is beautiful, the graphics are simple yet fun and overall it is a very addictive game, the only reason I give it 4/5 would be the crashing and bugs, it is still a very /very/ new game and I presume they will be fixed in the future but it is extremely frustrating when you have such a wonderful world ready to play and it crashes every two minutes, with this you just have to be patient but if I could change anything in this game I would try to fix the crash bugs, But overall a very fun and immersive game!",4
"Somehow runnable on mobile and ipad despite the details. Great character designs, story, and overall a really fun game. However, once you finish all the story quests there's nothing left to grind until they make another update. It then gets really boring and frustrating to wait for the banner you want and getting primogems is impossibly hard as it requires over 10k primos for 1 5* while each day you get 60 per commission and with the chance of not getting the character you want means you have to grind months just for one character. Higher ranks take forever to get, and they rarely give out interwined fates, or primogems, they only give us wishes for the standard banner when you level up. Nonetheless, it's a very enjoyable game when you first start but gets really demotivating, and without spending money getting anything you want may take months of patience, which I can say I don't have. I'd love for event reruns, or make them permanent like the Scaramouche one. And adding more gears and small co-op minigames like the hide and seek one. It'd also be fun to be able to play the lyre without doing the windblume ode event, as it is a very old event many people did not particpate in. Thanks!",4
"The game is a gorgeous world with plenty of explorations to make. I have plundered quite some time into the game over the past few days since launch. It is absolutely interesting and fun to play. However, there are some design I, as a player, would like some change on. 
First, about monetization, it is absolutely fine to expect making a lot of money from this game consider the development cost and everything. However, one thing this game does not differ from many other Chinese games is a hard effort cap in gaining characters. I have played effortlessly on gaining in-game currencies but I would say it at maximum gives one draw each hour of gameplay. With a 0.6% chance, you barely gain any 5 star characters by only playing. Before the game launches, I was honestly expecting to see more monetization options on skins and other customizations, instead of on characters.
Second, about protagonist gameplay, personally I would like the protagonist ‚Äútraveler‚Äù to have more weapon options, the ability to wield two elements at the same time, and cross-element skills.
Third, vehicle, bike, horse, or anything. :)
Fourth, about map improvement, currently the in-game map does not display any progression on one time collections or any collection.",4
Ok.. so we all know there is some cons to every pro in gaming. Well it‚Äôs basically a Japanese gotcha game. You don‚Äôt have to throw money at it but you can be rewarded for everything in the game which is slower. But the real reason for this review is the combat.. it‚Äôs amazing! Four party members to rotate in combat and different elements to play mix and match with. You can go for pyro-electro for explosions for massive AOE damage. There is an element to every character and they transfer to the next chosen character in battle. The targeting is pretty spot on to. Most games have this weird tap to cycle target but this one doesn‚Äôt. It lets you do everything on your own. The biggest con that this game has to begin with is grouping with your friends. The game doesn‚Äôt allow you to group till adventure level 15 (not character level 15). When you are able to get with your friends man it is so much fun cause the mix and match of elements is pretty crazy for the amount of things going on in the background. I give this game an honest 8/10.. The reason for is the gotcha system to pay to get ahead is a gimmick.. but other than that it‚Äôs super fun and would highly recommend to anyone and it‚Äôs free to play.,5
"Genshin Impact is a fantastic game.  From the get go, its absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail in each and every frame and background is astounding.  The story is captivating and every quest is interesting and not boring at all.  It definitely is a game that will keep you wanting to play more and more.  The way that the game changes weather and time is also beautiful as well.  I‚Äôve watched sunrises, sunsets, battled in the rain, fought numerous amounts of monsters, all within a MOBILE game.  The game is such an amazing mobile game that it feels like you‚Äôre playing on an actual console (or on the computer).  Paimon is definitely the most annoying character out there and RNG is the worst way to try and get characters ever because I have terrible luck BUT EVEN SO, the game is so much fun to play you will have trouble putting it down.  Each character also has unique abilities and there is so much to learn in this game.  Definitely would recommend and I‚Äôve had the most fun playing this game over all other games that I have ever played on a mobile phone.  Hands down, if I could give it 10/5 stars, I would. (But please, make Paimon less annoying, please).",5
"It‚Äôs like the love child of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Monster Hunter, Fire Emblem and Skyrim! Although the game has 4 player coop it is very much a solo experience. It plays like an actual game you would buy for the Nintendo Switch (of which is coming later). There is also a PC version which I recommend the most because it feels the most native, like it was made for it originally. It supports controller too! The game is cross platform save, meaning you can play with someone whose on their phone even if you‚Äôre on pc and even if you switch to a phone yourself ‚Äî you‚Äôll still have your save! There is voice acting for Chinese (The original I think? The only one to have the protagonist‚Äôs voice over in his profile‚Äôs story section), English (it‚Äôs grown on me and I really like some of the characters voices), Japanese (this is the most popular because of anime), and Korean (I also really like this one!). You can choose the female twin (Lumine) or the male twin (Aether) at the beginning, there is no difference except personal choice. I chose Aether because he reminded me of Link. I highly recommend Genshin Impact. You seriously won‚Äôt regret trying this game!",5
"Mihoyo, Genshin Impact is a great game. So great, that instead of curtains, I have a picture of Venti hanging over my window. But in order to convince my parents to pay for a five star every few weeks I have to make an entire slideshow trying to convince them they‚Äôre not wasting their money, you might say ‚Äúoh, just grind primogems, it‚Äôs not that hard‚Äù but taking honors classes, being in NJHS, playing 3 sports, and learning flute and guitar, doesn‚Äôt leave much time to grind, I have a friend who has nothing but free time, and we spend very similar amounts of money even though he plays much more than I do, every 5 star has cost us between 100 and 200 dollars. I hqve every 5 star besides Albedo and Mona, he has every 5 star besides Ganyu and Diluc. Not to mention with all the money you have to get from these insane prices, why does the game still crash every 10 minutes on iPad, I would play on my computer, but that‚Äôs even worse since the graphics, even at their lowest setting give my computer the equivalent of a seizure, making archery impossible, and causing the game to freeze when using Diluc‚Äôs alt. I find these things to be very annoying and hope they will be fixed in the future, thank you for reading until the end, have a good day/night!",3
"Genshin Impact draws you in like no other game. Since day one I have been blown away by the graphics the story and the level of detail put into this game. Not only are the graphics stunning the characters and their back stories are as well. There has been a ton of thought put into this game from the smallest blade of grass to the highest mountain top, everything you look at is detail oriented. This game is free to play, and they do not disappoint their players either. With thousands of quests and many different ways to earn in game currency they offer also a five dollar package that also gives you currency. I am not want to normally spend endgame, however, this game deserves every single penny that I spend on it. From the five star and 4 star characters to the Packages you can buy to upgrade them this game gives you everything that you ask for anymore. If I could give this app 10 stars I would I have never been so satisfied with a game in my whole entire life since the final fantasy series. Thank you for all that you guys do and I cannot wait for the next available character banner. I‚Äôm saving up those primogens! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"The games great, I played it on my moms ipad for a few decent moments and the animation was smooth, no lag. Im amazed that there can be a mobile game this good, but Im disappointed that on the ipad I played on, brand new by the way, without anything on it, deleted all photos and all other games, I was still kicked out every 5-10 minutes. I couldnt actually gain progress because it wouldnt save the things i did in simply 5 minutes, which is reasonable, but I dont think thats a problem I should have to worry about. Then, I tried to play on my iphone 7 to find it doesnt show water or sky, its black, and you can only see a half a chunk away. Of course, this is only for iphone 8s or lower, as it says in the game description. My problem with that is I dont understand why that would happen?? Iphone 7 or 6 is a phone i see a lot of people owning so its disappointing that it means a lot of iphone users cant play. I then tried it on my computer, and my moms computer, and yet again can only be in for a few seconds and get kicked out of the game almost as soon as it loads up. Genshin is amazing yes, but Im sad I have to save up for an entirely new computer to play it. Please fix these flaws.",4
"Has some of the worst pull rates I‚Äôve ever seen in a gacha. You can spend $450 on genesis crystals and still not get the character you want. The sad part is people are spending thousands of dollars to get these characters and the developers know the low rates bring profits. They‚Äôve figured out that people will pay massive amounts of cash to win, even if the rates are nearly impossible. People will literally spend themselves into debt to get these characters. Developers know this and take full advantage of it. 

The developers constantly ignore player feedback and don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks. Imagine paying a PS5 for each 5* character you want. That‚Äôs how much people shell out per character. It should be illegal to take advantage of people this way, but then again, if someone‚Äôs dumb enough to pay that much it‚Äôs hard to feel bad for them. All I will say is don‚Äôt get sucked into the trap, people. Stay away. 

If you ARE going to play this, I strongly recommend spending absolutely nothing. You should still be able to clear most of the game and not go broke in the process. Seriously, don‚Äôt spend a single dollar. It won‚Äôt get you anything anyway. Not with an 0.6% pull chance. The game itself could have been good, but the predatory design is wrong and not something I can support. For me, it‚Äôs too hard to enjoy the game knowing how greedy this company is.",1
"I‚Äôve had Genshin impact for a few months now and I absolutely love it however some quests and commissions plus character trials are too difficult. For example the quests where I‚Äôm timed are way too hard I almost always fail and can‚Äôt complete them on time. I also don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the point of doing commissions if they reset every 4 hours. I keep getting the same ones over and over again and it‚Äôs really frustrating because I know I‚Äôve already done them. Some of those are also timed so that makes them even more difficult and frustrating. I‚Äôm having a hard time leveling up my characters too because I don‚Äôt have enough mora to level them up because I‚Äôm not able to complete my quest and commissions which makes it hard to complete quests and commissions that aren‚Äôt timed as well as character trials. I‚Äôd really appreciate it if the developer or developers of Genshin impact read my review and looked into these issues I‚Äôm having and fixed them or at least gave me some tips on how I can do them without having as much issues as I‚Äôm having now, please and thank you!",5
"First, let me just say this game is absolutely fantastic and fun to play...for a week or so. Once you hit around Adventure Rank 30 you will become gated so hard by the resin (energy) system that you can only play for 30-60min a day with meaningful progression. Resin refreshes at a rate of 1/8min so you can regenerate 180 resin per day. All content that you need to grind (Mora [in game currency], character exp, weapon enhancement mats, skill enhancement books, world bosses, weekly bosses, equipment dungeons, etc) costs 20-60 resin each! Be careful spending money in this game because they have cleverly hidden this restriction since you can play an unlimited amount through exploring the map in the early game. It will not become apparent how painfully limiting this energy system is until you have finished the current main storyline (AR30). If you are an extremely casual player who can only play an hour a day, then yes you will be able to enjoy the game for quite some time. But if you are gamer that loves to progress as much as possible and level up all your characters then you will hit a brick wall. Even if you spend money to refresh your resin, your money will only net you a few extra minutes of playtime. One star until the devs fix their energy system and actually allow people to play their game without having to spend hundreds of $$$. Such a disappointment because this is one the best games on mobile",1
"This game is easily the best one I have ever played, especially since it‚Äôs able to be played on mobile. I literally got a new phone to play it. The graphics and music are absolutely stunning. I will listen to the soundtracks on Apple Music because I love them so much. Whether you are a free-to-play player, or you spend money on it, you can do anything. Each boss has its own challenge to it and it has never failed to amaze me. There isn‚Äôt one thing in the game to complain about. I‚Äôve fallen in love with every single character they‚Äôve released and I know I‚Äôll love all the ones they continue to make. They constantly add new and exciting quests and challenges every single update, each one better than the last. Each character and quest has such good background and lore behind them. Everything is so well written and thought out. The voice actors are also incredible no matter what language. If you have never played, you are missing out on so much. I cant even explain how addicting and fun this game truly is. Please give it a shot, I know you never be able to put it down after you do.",5
"I don‚Äôt know if this is intended but Mona‚Äôs dodge initially goes towards the enemy instead of the direction I‚Äôm trying to go. Whenever I use her ult the joystick disappears and I have to lift my finger and hold down to move again. This is REALLY annoying especially when I‚Äôm in a sticky situation where I have to back up that very second after casting the ult but I have to take that second to reactivate the joystick. Mona‚Äôs recovery takes longer than other characters...why? I‚Äôve actually tested this in the stone chamber domain. Once the Cryo mages dance (summons ice shards that orbits the mage) I constantly get knocked around until I‚Äôm out of the range, meanwhile when I use someone like chunyun, after the first knock up, he recovers pretty quickly (just like everyone else except Mona) and can dodge the second knock up. Next, I want to talk about her ‚Äúmirror reflection of doom‚Äù. This ability is weird with ranged enemies. Let‚Äôs say I activate this skill and it‚Äôs sitting between me and the ranged enemy, sometimes they redirect to the taunt but most of they shoot past the taunt and target me. If a solution can be made for the issues I‚Äôve explained, it‚Äôll make mine and probably other‚Äôs experience more enjoyable!",5
"Genshin Impact is one of my all time favorite games. It‚Äôs just the right mix of intense, fun, and difficult, and it makes me just went to keep coming back for more. The Wish stars in this game are even, too. Unlike other games, there is a good chance you will get something decent from every pull of a wish. I‚Äôve already gotten 2 characters and I‚Äôve only been playing for 1 1/2 months. The map and teleport waypoints are useful, because some other games make you walk or drive everywhere. I like how there are random camps of the enemy‚Äôs to keep battling and raising your points to level up. With brings me to the Adventures Guide. You get all sorts of rewards when you level up, and you can use some of those items to upgrade your weapon, or even get some Wishes. To me, there are no problems with the game. It does not get repetitive at all for me. There are no issues with the gameplay, and the game is always smooth and the graphics are amazing. There was a good amount of storyline at the beginning of the game and that storyline is starting to slack off, but I like the gameplay still beyond belief.",5
"I‚Äôve started to play this game a year ago, and left to the staggering amount of storage and data it took. Now, rejoining back to the game, I can see so many aspects that were overhyped and simply awful. First, you would believe that with how fast it takes to download the app, you *wouldn't* be greeted a massive data installation. The data took over half an hour to install. Second, I would find it a lot more convenient for transportation besides waypoints, because some quests in the game would take an ungodly amount of time. Third, the gacha system is way too time consuming to grind for a new character, let alone an ensemble of characters that the game has. Currently, I‚Äôm on Eagle Pass in the game, and the climbing system broke to a point where I can‚Äôt reach the next level. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a puzzle, but suspecting the point to climb to get to the next level, I‚Äôve tried every place to climb, and it‚Äôs absolutely unreachable. The tasks will take hours to complete, and even then, if you stop midway through a cutscene, you‚Äôll have to rewatch the entire cutscene AGAIN. The game is full of unnecessary time wasters, and I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend the game to people who just want to quickly sit down and play a good RPG.",3
"For an open world game, the quality, character designs, music, and word setting is pretty good. I like it alot, and play for a few hours or less, so I have plenty of game content to go through.  However, my main problem is storage. While, I have plenty of it to play on my tablet, it‚Äôs a pain to backup on the cloud. My internet speed is fast, but it still takes too long that I decided to pass. I‚Äôll play the game still, but no backup on the cloud, for now. Gacha rates could be better. There should be an option to earn characters and weapons through quests (King‚Äôs Raid style), beside gacha. This would make the game player friendly since more options are better to pleased players. Storage problem gives me mixed feelings to get into any future games by this company. While, Honkai: Star Rail looks beautiful and fun, I‚Äôm hesitated to try it as well. Some may like this game on mobile, but while playing a bit, Genshin Impact feels it meant to be on consoles, PC, and physical copies more. It would be much easier to deal with, while adding new events. If the game ever comes on Switch, I would like to play it there more than mobile though.",4
"This is probably one of the best games I‚Äôve played period and the fact it‚Äôs available on iOS is AWESOME. I originally started playing on my boyfriends phone which the game runs so smoothly on, but when I wanted to play it myself on my phone it crashes about 14 times within a hour in which my progress is not saved and sometimes when I load back in my character has plummeted to their death from gliding. If I am running through Liyue if I don‚Äôt wait the respective 15 seconds for the next 3 blocks to load I will also fall through the map (I.e at any bridge or uneven pathway) and end up dying or having to reset the game. Also during any ACTUAL cutscene it struggles and will freeze and the audio gets choppy and glitches out so I don‚Äôt get to see it at all, all the while my phone so hot when I am playing for longer than half an hour my phone will get almost unbearably hot. It would be pretty cool if The developers could create a low graphic mode to attempt a fix at the problem, I‚Äôm not tech savvy but I will be playing this game for a while and it would be so convenient if my game didn‚Äôt crash. Overall it is a great game and it‚Äôs worth it‚Äôs salt. But apparently my iPhone 9 doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to handle it.",3
"I gotta say I was a big Hu Tao main back last year. I loved Genshin back then and would play it every day, every hour. However, I started losing interest because you leaked the entire map of Sumeru, which made me lose all excitement about the map. Honestly, I preferred the Genshin where every update was mostly a mystery, that way I get the thrill. Now that you‚Äôre just exposing everything, it‚Äôs worthless playing if people online are just gonna spoil the game. Since Sumeru released, I lost total interest in the game, I tried going back, but it was boring to know what happens next since it has already been leaked. I can‚Äôt play this game without having a poker face, and I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt even be playing anymore. 
Let‚Äôs just say, I hate Sumeru, and all the characters and storyline. I may be sounding immature for saying that I hate the entire region and everything in it, but I can‚Äôt see myself ever getting excited or happy in that region. The Sumeru leaks, updates, and fandom ruined everything for me about Genshin. It made me lose a part of myself that I will probably never get back.",5
"I have been playing Genshin Impact for almost 2 years now, and I must say that this is THE BEST game I have ever played. I‚Äôve tried so many other games, and so far this is the only one that‚Äôs stuck around. It is honestly hard to get bored! Sometimes you may lose motivation when farming Primogems to then use to pull for new characters and weapons, but not often will there be a moment when you don‚Äôt want to move forward in the game. I wish that there was a better way for me to say just how much I like this game. Even the frustration from battling bosses and solving puzzles quickly resolves when I get the satisfaction of receiving good rewards. That definitely comes into play the most when farming for artifacts üòñ. It is quite the challenge getting your perfect artifact especially with the resin issue. It will definitely take multiple runs of a domain to find even a decent artifact! But when you finally get the artifact you were looking for, you feel great. I am so grateful to the game developers for their hard work and I am so proud that their game is getting the popularity it deserves! Thank you Hoyoverse!",5
"A few suggestions‚Ä¶ Hi, it‚Äôs me I commented about this game I believe a month ago. It was brought to my attention that I should suggest a few things to make this game better than it already is, don‚Äôt get me wrong this game is a very well done game and deserves more than a 5 star review believe me, but I‚Äôd like to add a view suggestions. Let‚Äôs start out with #1. When a player gets Co - op mode and everyone seems fine at first but then as your progress your unable to play with other people, and we get very confused then we figure out we must do quests to play Co - Op. The thing is, the second quest bugs everyone on mobile and or who have Lumine. ‚ÄúTrails in Tianqu‚Äù is the quest needed to complete  in order to be able to play with people again, for me it‚Äôs impossible to come Pete this quest because I‚Äôm on mobile and I also have lumine and in order to complete the time challege you need a geo character which I have only noelle. I cannot play until I login on computer which I complained about in my previous review. The second recommendation is to add crouching, crouching can be useful to dove attacks and to plunge onto enemies. This is all I have to say for now. Great game, I love it.",4
"So! I play this a good bit. Great game! But the gacha part of this game is never in your favor.
Everyone remember Hu Tao‚Äôs rerun? Well! I saved up to 12,800 primogems to wish for Hu Tao do the math. 80 wishes and I didn‚Äôt obtain Hu Tao. I got Ganyu in her rerun after I paid to get the crystals to get primogems! Short answer for how much money I spent to get Ganyu. A LOT. This games odds are stacked against you. From leveling to getting new characters. If you never use the wish system you are simply stuck with Aether (or Lumine), Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa. Unless the story calls for it. You will NEVER get another character in this game. The game relies on something called relics, weapons, and leveling. Don‚Äôt worry about weapons though! The wish system will pump those out more than character‚Äôs so you‚Äôre good there! But relics? Sorry bub you have to do domains to get good relics to help you in your quest! But‚Ä¶YOU GUESSED IT. That system also relies on RNG to get stuff you actually need to make your characters effective. Game also gets harder the more you get your adventure rank up. So more grinding! As I said without relics or good weapons you may as throw rocks at whatever you‚Äôre fighting. They did a good job with odds of getting characters in Honkai impact idk why the system works the way it does now. Good luck getting yelan. Quick way for developers to make money off you.",1
"i can‚Äôt say that i‚Äôm not obsessed with this game: i 100% am. i just think there‚Äôs a lot to be worked on. the boss drops are so stingy it hurts. the amount of primogems/fates you get is so stingy as well. i understand being stingy to a degree; you need to make money one way or another, yes, but making it so you have to grind for months on end if you‚Äôre a free to play player for a what? 90 wishes? i‚Äôve seen people grind for 4 months straight and only get 180 wishes out of that, which yes is good! but if we got a little bit more primogems with specific quests or challenges that would be so much more worth it. like the spiral abyss, 100 primogems per 3 stars is really good and that makes a lot of sense!! but you‚Äôre telling me that i‚Äôm only going to get 100 primogems after getting to Adventure Rank 35? unbelievable. besides how stingy the game is with primogems and loot drops, it‚Äôs utterly amazing. the storyline and characters are great and it‚Äôs definitely addicting! the resin refill time/amount of resin is baffling. it takes a long time to refill your resin (unless you have primogems, but f2p usually don‚Äôt spend them on resin) and you only get 160. that‚Äôs hardly enough to farm for 4 characters ascension materials and talent books.",3
"ive had this game since it released and it is honestly the best game ive ever played(ive played a lot). the story line is really good and theres always twists and turns in it. the voice acting is amazing and full of emotion(not cringey) and i actually grow attached to the characters. it's open world which i love, you can play with friends which i also love, its not p2w at all, and u can take ur time without feeling like u have to catch up. i love building the characters and every aspect of the game. the bosses and enemies aren't overpowering so u wont get stuck somewhere. i honestly didnt think i would like a game where u pull for characters but this game changed my mind. im honestly shocked this game is free. 
i do have an idea that would be cool to see. it would be awesome if you guys could add adventure teams or ‚Äúgroups‚Äù where friend‚Äôs can join or create their own teams and visit each others world and fight together and get rewards for it. even i think that would help keep ppl playing and get more attached to the game if they grew closer with other players and make memories together.
anyways great game i dont see myself quitting anytime soon!",5
"I‚Äôm literally addicted to this game. There is not a single bad thing about the game itself, and the graphics are SOOOO AMAZING! I never have internet problems or lag while playing this!<3 If you‚Äôre wondering why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, well there‚Äôs 2 reasons‚Ä¶ 1- I CAN‚ÄôT GET ANY CHARACTERS EVERY TIME I WISH I GET A STUPID SWORDS- but I know there is obviously a pity system and out of all the time I‚Äôve been playing now I already have tons of 5 star characters! I am a f2p player 2. It takes soooo much storage, now I know not much can be done about this. If we want the full amazing experience that Mihoyo has created for us, I understand that it‚Äôll take us to sacrifice a bit more of our storage then we expected! I still love the game wholeheartedly, and if you got through reading this entire review well‚Ä¶. You‚Äôve gotten this far, download it already or you‚Äôll have wasted your time!
Edit: after Sumeru‚Äôs release I kind of fell off from playing Genshin and now that I feel more left behind in the content I kind of have no motivation. I will try to get as much content as I can done to get myself back in the zone.",5
"I am continuously disappointed by the misrepresentation of darkskinned individuals and cultures. The release of Candace‚Äôs splash art has officially proven that your company is racist and colorist. Kandake, who Candace is based off of, is described as a very dark skinned woman. The blatant disrespect of Candace‚Äôs design is prevalent with her skin color. She is tan, not darkskinned. The representation that many we‚Äôre looking for in her is completely lost because of this. It is outrageous that time and time again, your company is able to represent culture through characters. The most prevalent example is Yunjin. Her design embodies Chinese culture, in my opinion, pretty well and the fact that you cannot do this with Candace is blatantly racist. You continuously refuse to give darkskinned people their representation and I‚Äôm disappointed. You, as a multimillionaire company, should be able to give characters a darker skin color and to be able to properly represent Egyptian culture. Another issue that I‚Äôd like to point out is Dori. Her design is stereotypical and orientalist and you should remove her from the game. The pink creature she is seen to be sitting on is representing a god. It‚Äôs disgusting how you allowed this to get into your game. I hope you can correct this mistake and represent cultures better in the future. I am honestly terrified to think about what you plan to do on Natlan.",1
"When I first turned to AR 40 I was very happy, cause I was able to do some multiple story quests, and do the we will be reunited quest I except it to be not so hard nor easy, fighting the Abyss Harald is annoying when you fight it for the last time literally a abyss mages summons and I won‚Äôt just go over to the mages to fight it cause I will still die while dodging them, this make me fighting a level 68 Boss like and 2 Abyss Mages that Ice and Fire and causes Melt, I tried for 3 times and just gave up its to complicated trying to do cause my team is average and didn‚Äôt decide how I wanted to be yet. I even tried it with a healer also known as Barbara and she died when the boss was at Half of the health, I was pretty much dissatisfied after almost dying to the run hunter, ruin guard. Its just to complicated to complete I know the Abyss Harald is like the big enemy and you have to kill it but you didn‚Äôt had add a Abyss mages! It makes it more difficult and now I cant do CO-OP what‚Äôs the point of doing that when the quests doesn‚Äôt even have CO-OP this is really stupid. Overall I think you should at least remove 1 Abyss Mage or at least find a way to make the battle easier cause I am not doing the quest for long until my party can actually manage some Ruin Hunters trying to kill me.",2
"I am absolutely in love with this game!! The graphics are so smooth and beautiful. The scenery is very well done. The animations are pretty as well. Everything is so beautiful. I wish they could release Genshin Impact on Xbox though but, that‚Äôs the company‚Äôs decision to do so. Anyway, I wish I joined earlier so, I could‚Äôve grinded for primos and characters earlier. My friend joined before the game got big and they have all the 5 stars! I‚Äôm so jealous. Their account got hacked but, thankfully, they got it back and I‚Äôm happy for them! Some people have trouble with using the characters, especially Razor, for some reason but, I‚Äôve never had any problems with it. Maybe because I play mobile. Most people play on PC and sometimes the FPS is really bad. I‚Äôve tried downloading it on my computer before and it downloaded but, as I said before, the FPS is bad but, my computer is pretty old so that also might be the problem. Overall, this game is amazing and I totally recommend it for new players! Just remember you might get a gambling addition when playing XD. Well, new players and old players, have fun!! Love you guys! (platonically of course) <3",5
"i was skeptical at first, because most games that look this beautiful are usually false advertisement. But, this game truly is as beautiful as it looks. It is absolutely so fun, and there is so much to do when it comes to both main and side quests. It is an open world type game, so look for hidden gems and chests, too! Just exploring is beautiful and all the stories somehow fit together. Ranking up is fairly easy, but it still can be a bit of a challenge, which is great. You don't want something you can just blow through. They have great in-game shops where you can spend coins you find from just exploring. Hardly would you have to ever actually use real currency to play or profess, which in itself is amazing! The voice overs and the characters you can both earn, and win through Wishes are so great, and some of them are so adorable lol. I've already found quite a few I favor. This game is great to pass time and I highly recommend it simply because it's relaxing, yet has a lot of combat, exploration and just all around goofy fun, too. It's free, so it wouldn't hurt for anyone to just give it a try. You'll fall in love, trust me. <3",5
"All I could say about this game is ‚Äúinsane.‚Äù In every aspect; From graphics, gameplay, storyline, character design and so much more, this game is insane. Sure, there are some things to work on, but otherwise, if your in the ages between 11-14, this game is awesome. Personally, I‚Äôve never liked the Anime style but this game changed my mind. I think Genshin is the perfect game to kill boredom! I love receiving new characters and going on quests. Overall, this game is amazing. I know your waiting for the ‚Äúbut.‚Äù Well here it is. But, the game takes up much more storage then it needs too. Therefore, I play it on a website on my computer called GeForce NOW. Literally awesome you can play so many games for free. Well anyway, I would 100% recommend this game. Soooo fun. Im taking up alot of your time, sorry about that. 

Sooo, If your wondering wether to get this game, look at your storage. Do you have 14GB to download this game? No? Well go on your computer, go to GeForce NOW and start playing it. (Only downside is that you get to play for 1 hour for free each day, if you buy premium, you have unlimited time) Well, enjoy your game! :)",5
"This game is a easy 10/10 just the fact that its so amazing! And the characters are so good! My friend was always on the game and i kept asking why she‚Äôs so glued to the game. She didn‚Äôt answer. Then some girls in my class liked the game too. And since i have the setting on my phone that it is where you have to send a request to ur parents if u can have the game. But if you downloaded it before. You don‚Äôt have to send the request you can just click download then it will start downloading. So when i first got my phone. I didnt have the setting where you have to ask to get the app. So when i got my phone i saw genshin then downloaded it. But i played it like once and didnt like it so i decided to delete it. So back to my best friends saying that its a good game. I decided to get it again. And when i got in, i already got bored. But i forced myself to play. So i made my account. And play for like 3 hours! I understand why my friends liked the game so much! So its a 100% a 10/10! I highly recommend you to download this game. If ur seeing my feedback of course. But anyways. Have a nice day! Baiii! ü§çüòÑüéÆ",5
"This game is really fun! There are lots of things to do in the game. I love the scenery and the playstyle of various characters. There are a few problems though, grinding primogems is hard late game where there are not lots of quests to do. You end up spending hours to grind a few hundred primogems. It is hard to grind without feeling tempted to spend money. The female characters outfits are almost always way too revealing, and I think you can make a good looking outfit without revealing clothes. I would also like more dark characters, it would make dark skinned people feel more respected. There is no one of African descent as a playable character yet there are characters of every other racial/ethnic group. Most of the time the suggestions to make the game better are ignored and some people start to quit. If Mihoyo listened to the community, they would gain more players. Overall, the game itself is fun and interesting and keeps me occupied for a long time, if Mihoyo listened to our feedback, they would get more players to join and would get people to play the game while keeping old players at the same time.",5
"1. The render distance could be fixed, for example over at Dragonspine the mountains look completely rendered and high quality and keep in mind they are way over a mile from you sometimes but in the kingdom of Monsdadt you could be less then a mile and it looks like a Ps1 game
2. The characters, the characters when you are playing them are very high quality but when your talking to them through dialogue there is no details the cloths are basically painted on there skin but when you are in a normal fight your characters, your teammates characters and the monster are perfectly detailed so that does bug me a lot
3. The game is hard to actually make look good without constant crashing. The game when you have it in high quality settings is rlly good but at the same time you open your wishes and bam crash which greatly annoys me. It would be nice if you could add a feature where you could see what settings would cause your games more lag so that way you can make your game look good with more control.
That‚Äôs about it the rest of the game is pretty good and I enjoy the game besides those issues
Great job Mihoyo",4
"I‚Äôve heard a lot of bad comments about ghenshin impact and the comments I here specifically are:1  ‚Äúit‚Äôs a paid to win game‚Äù or 2 ‚Äúthe characters that are five stars/ the newer characters are way to strong. it‚Äôs frankly not true,  for starters yes, you can trade in money for primogems and outfits but you can‚Äôt defeat the game, and their is only and chance of getting the characters you pine for. they do this in every game. Give you a opportunity or option. you don‚Äôt even haft to use money it‚Äôs a game where they give you free primogems monthly so you have enough to draw characters and events so everyone has a chance to get some from playing the actual game. secondly  the reason people call certain characters 5 star is because if used rightly they can become a main in your team and are a not easily obtainable character. They are supposed to be strong that‚Äôs what makes them different from 4 star and a 4 from a 3 star. This game is wonderful it has a beautiful story behind it and the background scenery, and unique character design is something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see.",5
"When I first started Genshin, I enjoyed it very much. The initial grind was rewarding, exploring Teyvat was fun, and the stories of Mondstadt and Liyue were enjoyable and well written. Though once you start to get up into higher AR ranks, grinding for artifacts and weapon materials becomes almost like a chore. When you are lower you seem to have so much to do, but when you‚Äôre higher it‚Äôs like all you can do is sit there and wait a month or two for a ‚Äúnew‚Äù event to come out which has similar mechanics to older, previous events but just with some new story line that is hardly entertaining. Inazuma‚Äôs story pales in comparison to Mond and Liyue. Raiden was a decent villain, but her redemption was rushed and almost felt like they wanted us to sympathize with her just so that they could sell her off to us in the gacha. Also, as a mobile user I sometimes have issues with turning the screen. I am not sure if this is my phone‚Äôs fault or if it‚Äôs the game. But it refuses to turn sometimes when I am fighting. Overall Genshin is a very nice game visually and has wonderful voice acting, also it has many lovable characters to choose from, but after the initial excitement of the game you will start to get a bit bored.",3
"This game is by far the best for a free game, the story is amazing, the graphics are stunning, the music is beautiful, however, my slight complaint with this game is similar to ramƒìn‚Äôs review, yet again another game that is lower quality on mobile. Same thing happens on my gen 7 iPad and I at least think it would be fair to fix the animation cutscenes from stuttering, the rest I can deal with, but the stuttering is just too annoying... don‚Äôt get me wrong, like I said at the beginning, this game is very fun and enjoyable when all is added up, not to mention it‚Äôs ranked as the #1 game (as of January) in the App Store and has a lot of positive reviews. I just wish I don‚Äôt have to have a pc just to get a better experience out of it. Oh yeah, and also I‚Äôm stuck on adventure rank 31 because the COMMISSIONS ARE TOO FRIGGIN HARD, how do you think I‚Äôm supposed to make my way over to someone who ordered food AND defeat 3 Pyro slimes including a mega slime in under 2 minutes?! so to the person who wrote a review with the title ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt regret downloading this game‚Äù I have a statement for you, the only thing I‚Äôm not going to regret is uninstalling this game! How disappointing üòí. I‚Äôm sorry if at this point I‚Äôm sounding like an App Store Karen, but I don‚Äôt see a point in putting this game in the mobile App Store if it‚Äôs not fully playable for MOBILE USERS. Thank you for at least reading",1
"This game is simply beautiful, it‚Äôs fun and well written. Aside from the little hell spawn that is Paimon, I love all the characters and find them engaging and well designed. It looks great on ipad and even better on PC (though I‚Äôd love to see it come to MacOS), and while it does look great on PS4 as well, Sony, as always, refuses to play ball so there‚Äôs no cross save available for it. I‚Äôm really enjoying the world so far and am quite intrigued to see how it will open up. So why not 5 stars? As with all gacha games, the method of acquiring new heroes is even more annoying than Paimon. I really enjoy Mihoyo games, they‚Äôre top quality stuff and really entertaining, but as much time as I put into Honkai Impact, I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to keep playing because it would end up costing upwards of $500 to get the character I was actually looking for. As much as I‚Äôm loving this game, I worry the same will happen. I would gladly pay $60 for this game and $20 for every expansion they added and like $5-10 or whatever for skins if it didn‚Äôt have those god awful random loot mechanics. It‚Äôs a wonderful game, but knowing I‚Äôd likely have to reach into my pockets for it to give me a 5 star hero is going to keep me from giving it a 5 star review.",4
"When I say non-gamer, I mean the last time I played an RPG was On a game boy advance or PS2. Obviously you can still use those systems now, but technology has allowed for games to develop far more than what I‚Äôm used to. That being said, as much as I find these sorts of games to be interesting to play, the interface is unfamiliar, the stories are elaborate and the game as a whole just feels overwhelming to play. NOT Genshin Impact. 

My entire time of playing this game I‚Äôve thought how easily accessible it is to people who normally don‚Äôt play these types of games. The graphics are amazing, the music is relaxing, the story is engaging and everything is easy to follow! The beauty of being able to play across platforms makes it THAT much easier to fall into the depths of this game. I‚Äôve missed my stop on the bus going home twice within the first week of playing because it was so addicting. 

Any person who plays games or RPGs might probably say that there are many games that are like that once you give them the chance. And there probably are, I‚Äôm in no position to say. BUT I will say if you wana try to get into RPGs, Genshin Impact is a wonderful place to begin.",5
As a long time player I honestly love the game and enjoy it. I do wish that it didn‚Äôt use gacha systems though as I‚Äôve lost so many 50/50‚Äôs even when I spent money (I do not suggest as it is not worth itü•≤) the pity system is kind of nice but it takes so much time just to build it. I also wish there where more ways to get primogems because I‚Äôm broke and genuinely need better characters lol. I love the community and enjoy how helpful everyone is with everything and how funny but wholesome the game can be. (Story wise and just playing with friends or strangers) However with so many updates coming out it‚Äôs really hard for my friends who play on phones to keep the game as they don‚Äôt have enough storage space. I wish that they would bring the game to more platforms such as The Nintendo switch or maybe Xbox because so much of the player base is only on phone. It genuinely breaks my heart seeing so many people have to leave the game just for the sake of their storage space. At this point you need a whole phone just dedicated to playing it. So please Mihoyo add this to more consoles. But otherwise this game is very fun and enjoyable.,4
"Honestly, seeing the sumeru trailer just confirmed for me that there will be no diversity in this game. For god sake there are only 2 darker skinned characters in the game as of current. And all of the npc‚Äôs in the trailer for sumeru are also paper color. And from the‚Ä¶. (if you know you know) there is only going to be 2-3 more darker skinned characters in sumeru, despite it being a region based on North Africa and South Asia. I know that not all of the people there are of darker skin. But it goes the other way around as well. Not all of the people there are paper color. There should be a good balance with a slight bias towards darker skinned characters. And the archon should definitely be darker skinned. Also with characters that are carrying names that are significant in those cultures, they should have some resemblance to the person who‚Äôs name they are taking on. It‚Äôs just a blatant disrespect and disregard towards people of that culture, as well as the historical figures that they are using as a guideline for the characters. I like this game a lot and I have seen how hoyoverse/ mihoyo can make characters well, as well as make them culturally appropriate. I‚Äôm writing this complaint because of how much I like this game and I want to see it improve, not decline how it is right now. Moral of the story is, Hoyoverse /Mihoyo, DO YOUR RESEARCH THOROUGHLY AND MAKE THESE SUMERU CHARACTERS LOOK BETTER PLEASE.",1
This game is incredible amazing I love it so much but it‚Äôs so crashing and kick me out the game a lot When I try to play and I love the characters and I‚Äôm making a lot of friends there but I wish The game support low mobile like IPhone 6 so it won‚Äôt crash I have a lot of storage and using it for Genshin Mihoyo if you see this pls I beg you beg you to make your game for low device not crash and Mihoyo you are a Chinese based company that is now inspiring the world with your resolution game tension that spread world wide and being a hugest successful game in China and you represent China and the ccp and you will get a lot of players of money if you fix the crashing setup for Mobile players and more bugs and pls Try to interact with the community so we can make the game more better and You can represent China/CCP more and plus make the game take less storage and pls bring back old events and makes events part of the story quests alit of people and more people will play more and Mihoyo you will get tons of money and also pls start to comfirmed some stuff to be canon and you are a great game company,5
"People who complain about this game need to come to their senses, because you can‚Äôt get a better gaming experience than this so y‚Äôall are just needy. 
The characters are mostly fun to use and have cool designs. Things of note are‚Ä¶ first, the storage this game takes is INSANE. As with most games, especially open world ones, will take lots of data, but 16 gigabytes?! On a MOBILE PHONE??!! No wonder it ain‚Äôt coming to switch!
Second, the teapot furniture limit is very low. The teapot would be my favorite thing in the entire game other than sumeru, alhaitham and Nilou, but you can place barely anything! Yet you put so much effort into building the world and I can‚Äôt fit a fish tank and a couch into the same room together. Third, the account issues. Sometimes, it just doesn‚Äôt let you log into the game, and not always because of maintenance. Just a log in error, and it doesn‚Äôt go away for a while. I delayed starting the game for a month because I couldn‚Äôt log in.
I‚Äôm keeping the 5 stars because I‚Äôd be asking for too much out of the game for it being on my phone.
Have a great day, stranger!",5
"I absolutely love open-world RPGs, and Genshin Impact is one of the best by far! The story is captivating, the visuals are beautiful, and the character designs are extremely attractive; this one takes the cake! Unlike many other games I‚Äôve played, which have so many different instructions and events that it‚Äôs frustrating and confusing, everything was surprisingly easy to adjust to and figure out! I‚Äôm still not able to afford my own computer yet, so I‚Äôm so glad this game also runs on mobile! I do have one problem though. Everything runs extremely smoothly, but my game crashes a lot while I‚Äôm playing, and gets worse with every part of the map I uncover. I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of‚Äîcleaning out my storage space, deleting apps, deleting old conversations and photos, etc‚Äîand it still is progressively getting worse (I‚Äôm playing this on an iPad btw). I‚Äôm not quite sure how to resolve this issue and I‚Äôm looking for possible suggestions. Other than that, Genshin Impact is such a blast, and I‚Äôm so excited for the next update! Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"When Genshin first launched, it was honestly amazing how a free mobile game can have such amazing graphics. Despite being a gacha game, players were given a plentiful amount of gacha currency and MiHoYo would give the players free pulls when they hit certain milestones. As months go by MiHoYo slowly becomes more and more stingy and begin turning a blind eye to the community. Players have been begging MiHoYo to fix things to make their gameplay easier, problems that should‚Äôve been fixed long ago is still in the the game. MiHoYo never listens to the community and despite Genshin being a massive hit and MiHoYo gaining billions of dollars within the first months of Genshin all thanks to the millions of players that supported the game. MiHoYo didn‚Äôt care, they don‚Äôt value the players and didn‚Äôt even thanks us for supporting Genshin and making them come this far. I‚Äôve spent a couple of dollars on the game but after seeing that MiHoYo said nothing to the players during Genshin‚Äôs first anniversary. I‚Äôm thinking of not spending money anymore and everyone should do the same, even if it‚Äôs tempting to spend money, don‚Äôt do it. MiHoYo doesn‚Äôt value the players and as long as they‚Äôre making money. They will continue being greedy.",3
"Big enough to pull its stars rating down. It‚Äôs not the Hours and hours of continuous entertainment you get from playing. Whether you play solo or up to 4 people together. The game runs smooth on Apple iPad . Its size is not one of the issues. it‚Äôs the biggest game thats ever been. Once installed it takes up 15GB. Even so, I recommended this game for anyone above 8yrs old. The first issue with the game. We use to have total control of who is targeted 100% of the time. That is no longer true. Now. You can be in the middle of a battle if you get to close to a tree and suddenly your battling wood while the enemy is blasting away at your HP. Changing targets back requires finesse. I‚Äôve tried to find a way to turn this off without success. The other issue. Updates. There always about 3.5GB. They don‚Äôt simply add new data. You install the game over and over every update. Seriously give us a break. Since the last update the game no longer reveals its real size. Any data added after the game itself is no recognized as system data. The last update put the total size at 18Gb. It‚Äôs going to be even bigger now in this updates expansion pack for the new area.",3
"From the start I have been giving MHY a low rating (1 star for the quality of the game). The reason is pretty obvious is because of MHY‚Äôs greediness and the way they design the rate for pulling characters and weapons. In addition when the community raises problems to be fixed, MHY don‚Äôt really fix it. Plus just recently starting from Baal‚Äôs banner a lot of problem for the new character is locked away from constellation. Only through unlocking constellation can you fix that issue of that character. Plus the anniversary rewards came up by MHY is truly very small for the amount of support from the big player base. The amount the spenders spend on this game can not get MHY to want to give back to the players for the big amount of support they receive. MHY kept keeping us away from the KFC wing we been waiting for nearly 6 months for and gave no updates. This really stems from the main head quarter in China and it is not the Global fault. It is also quite sad that MHY don‚Äôt really listen to Global players as much as they do to their Chinese players. Plus in MHY app called HoYoLAB and their Discord they censor any criticism you have towards the game and company. They really be trying to shut down players who have been supporting this game since day 1. Please and I encourage everyone to voice your opinion as much as possible.",1
"MiHoYo has done a very poor job in proving they are receptive to the community‚Äôs concerns about a number of things over the last 2-4 months. It goes to show just how little they care about providing an actual enjoyable experience to their user base. The game has seen the release of some of the worst characters to date and when players voices their concerns through the appropriate channels, they intentionally deleted or hid the criticism. The 1-year anniversary is literally one day away and MiHoYo has made zero effort to mark the significance of this day. The player-based helped this game get as popular as it is. They deserve a show of appreciation. It is laughable that MiHoYo thinks they can give players copy-paste rewards from a previous event and consider this sufficient. Not to mention the fact that they didn‚Äôt even bother to send out a notice to all the players to mark the occasion. It goes to show they really do not care. Seriously consider if you‚Äôd like to give your precious time and money to a company that is so tone deaf and out of touch with it‚Äôs target audience. These are incredibly bad choices and accepting them sets a bad precedent about what they can and will get away with in the future if there isn‚Äôt appropriate pushback.",2
"The character designs, game play, lore, and amazing music and voice acting make Genshin Impact my favorite game thus far. After a full year of playing, I am staying enjoying it every day. The amount of care and effort, and the attention to detail put into this game is insane. I think the pacing of new content is just right, where you don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed with too much all at once but you also aren‚Äôt stagnant and bored for a long time. If you binge the game in one go and play non stop, of course you‚Äôll get burnt out and tired (like any other game). But if you take it at your own pace and enjoy the story and music and scenery, it‚Äôll be a fun time for a long time. 

The music is probably my favorite part of the game. They put so much effort into incorporate regional instruments and culture into each piece of music, and further more the music are performed by live orchestras from each area the regions are inspired by. (The London philharmonic for Mondstat, Shanghai philharmonic for Liyue, and Tokyo philharmonic for Inazuma so far). 

I can‚Äôt wait to see what else will come and foresee playing this game well into the future!",5
"I‚Äôm going to make this quick and simple. There is a distinct lack of communication and appreciation from Hoyoverse to the Genshin Impact community for what the players wish for and what they get instead. Genshin Impact has made billions in the last two years of its release, and this is due to fans supporting the game through in game purchases and buying their merchandise. However, the appreciation that Hoyoverse has given to their fans, who have built the tower they stand on, is non existent. The rewards from both playing the game itself and from major events such as the anniversary are so minimal for what the fans have given them that it is insulting. For the amount that they earn from our money and time towards the game, they give less than 10x the amount back in the game. The Genshin Impact community does not even feel in the least as though Hoyoverse appreciates our support for them. Along with how repetitive and boring the gameplay has been and addressing of very little of what the players have been asking for, it has created an environment between company and fans where no one can appreciate the other. I can only hope that 2022‚Äôs anniversary rewards aren‚Äôt as disappointing and pathetic as 2021‚Äôs, and that it genuinely feels as though we are celebrating something grand.",1
"Dont get me wrong, i LOVE genshin, the story, the voice acting. I just love the thought of being able to just- go nearly anywhere and do whatever you please without being forced out of areas certain areas because the game doesn't think your ready to go to Liyue or something, just some‚Ä¶minor issues. No actually pretty big issue. Getting characters is probably the biggest thing for a RPG like game such as this, so when you make the currency to even GET a pull very rare/hard to buy, the LEAST you can do is make‚Ä¶idk you luck of getting a 5 star go up by like 0.5 percent until you get one then it resets or maybe a setting that turns off the game‚Äôs ability to give you a character you already got! But nope, not even a tiny bonus like that. Not to mention the glitch where your screen is black but the cutscene is playing without you seeing whats going on. If i had a dollar  every time i had to look up the cutscene because the stupid game wont let me see the cutscene i‚Äôd be a billionaire in no time.
In conclusion 
Fix your cutscene glitch and do SOMETHING about the difficulty of getting a character, anything!",4
"so I've been playing genshin impact for more than 3 months and I'm at around ar 43 and it so good I really like the art and the music and voice over and everything abt it but their are three problems here which is 1st it so glitchy like at least a glitch every 10 mins I use my iPhone and ps4 for the game but it so glitchy 2nd the most things that give primogems is the spirals abyss which give 2400 primogems it wouldve been better if their is another event which give at least 5k or like give 5k on the player birthday cuz when I got my birthday gift it was so basic like a cake what can we do with it? We cant even eat it or at least give us a character we don't have on our birthday ok not a 5 star it ok if it a 4 star but ofc it wouldve been better if we get a 5 star! And I'm not giving hate ofc 
3rd it take FOREVER to load at first or when it update when I first downloaded the game it took a whole day and when it loaded it took half a day so pls make it less at least wait one hour not a day and a half! And of course I LOVE this game so much and I have no hate toward this game I hope u read this <33",5
"I really love this game! The graphics are amazing, the battles are fun, and the voice acting is really nice to listen to. However, this game also has a few problems. One of them is the immense crashing. Every 5-15 minutes, the game crashes and it's getting really annoying. If it helps, sometimes I see red or green lines on the buildings before the game crashes. Another problem is the battery usage. Only this game drains too much of my battery and sometimes my iPad starts overheating. I've checked the other apps ands it's only this game that's causing the problem. Also, the enemy spawns sometimes takes way too long. For example, there's this quest where you have to unlock a tri-seal. The Meaty tribe has this sort of challenge and you get 1 minute and 35 seconds to defeat 10 enemies. The problem is, the enemies take too long to spawn and the result is 50 seconds of battle time. And those 50 seconds are becoming shorter because of the spawn time of the boss, so I can't pass the challenge. Please fix this, especially the crashing. I will hate to have to delete this game because of it.",5
"Genshin Impact is literally my favorite game now. I was in a bad state of depression and stuff, but then my friend told me about it so i decided to download it! I will never regret downloading it, ever! There are so many cool characters! My personal favorite is Raiden Shogun, and they are SO detailed! The graphics are crazy good quality and the voices don‚Äôt glitch out at all, it‚Äôs just so good! like it‚Äôs just perfect for any kind of situation! It also works on cell data! It‚Äôs a bit slow, but it still works! Genshin Impact is one of the best games, they really did do well on it! However, I have noticed a few problems. People do come to my world and take items without permission, I‚Äôve had it done multiple times. I think maybe a setting should be added where they can‚Äôt take things from your world maybe. One more, is that my internet in the game crashes and I have to get off and get back on. This is probably my bad wifi, but well I don‚Äôt know . Overall, This is one of the best games out there, I‚Äôd say better than Roblox and most popular games! Goodbye now üòª",5
"When I first heard Genshin Impact, I thought it‚Äôd just be a boring game of having to go with the starter characters and etc, but when I delved into this game the game was really fun. Not only do you get to do your own thing, such as procrastinate from doing a quest you cant get passed. I know lots of other games wont allow that & you MUST complete the main quests to be able to do other things. However, Genshin Impact does not do this, instead they just let you go hunt for treasure chests to level up, (it‚Äôd take longer to level up if you just do that). The game is absolutely F2P friendly. The downside of this is that ‚ÄúCo-Op‚Äù the resources and work you‚Äôve done in another player‚Äôs world does not TRANSFER over to your own world. That is such a bummer since me and my friends enjoy going on adventures together. Before I forget, the ‚Äúco-op‚Äù mode to be opened is AR 16, Which I personally think should get lowered to AR5 or something. Overall pretty good game. I play on Mobilee, iPhone 11, runs well, even though my wifi isn‚Äôt the top notch wifi, the graphics are amazing, scenery is great. Definitely download! ‚ô•Ô∏è",5
"Genshin Impact is a good game, but it takes up a lot of storage. I know a majority of mobile players complain about this, but it really does take up A LOT of storage. As a F2P (free-to-play) player, it‚Äôs pretty hard to resist spending money on this game with so many characters. Most of the 5 star characters are very OP, but because they‚Äôre 5 stars, they are harder to get. That means that you have to farm Primogems (a currency for wishing) all of the time to save up enough just for a 5 star character that you might not have even wanted (because there is a 50% chance that you get another character) I know a lot of people wrote reviews about they not getting the character they wanted, or things that people who never played the game can understand, so if you‚Äôve never played this game before, you‚Äôre welcome for writing a decent review that you can understand. If I could go back to the past, I would just finish the main story and stop playing. I think that way I wouldn‚Äôt waste so much time farming for a video game character that I think is cool, and get burnt out. But, I do like how much effort was put into this game. The graphics are amazing. Sadly most people playing on mobile might not even be able to see the amazing graphics because of the horrible lag.",2
Is really laggy and glitchy on the iPhone 7 like ik they recommend a iPhone 8 Plus but still can they at least add some kind of like settings menu to lower the graphics to make it run better or at least make it soo it doesn‚Äôt take soo much ram like the A10 still is capable of running good looking games if optimized correctly also I have a friend with a iPhone 11 and the game also lags there and even crashes soo I think there is some kind of optimization problem with it but yea great game the iPhone version needs some fixing I guess I‚Äôll stick to my ps4 until I get a switch or it gets fixed for iOS I really did make a mistake getting a 1299 dollars monster pc instead of taking a switch and saving some for the iPhone 12 whenever it comes out and getting more simple pc because to be honest my pc is way too overkill for the games I play I got too hyped with this rtx 3080 I should have taken a rtx 2060 instead anyways ik this probably will no get attention by the devs but if it doesn‚Äôt please add a settings menu or make some extra optimizations to it if possible,5
"I was very curious about this game and heard it was an open world RPG, so I had to try it. I regret nothing. I love it. I love more than Breath of the Wild. Okay maybe not more than Breath of the Wild, but it‚Äôs definitely up there. There are so many lovable characters and the story goes on forever. There world is pretty big and I believe there‚Äôs even more of it that I haven‚Äôt unlocked yet. Best: it‚Äôs free and doesn‚Äôt have a single ad. It‚Äôs the game of my dreams. The combat system is well thought out and interesting, there is a wide variety of enemies, and there‚Äôs even dogs and cats (that you can‚Äôt pet, but oh well).
My one problem: the game crashes all. The. Time. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôll get a good 10 minutes of gameplay and boom, crash. Most of the time everything saves before it crashes and I don‚Äôt lose any progress, but when in the middle of a fight or conversation, I‚Äôll have to start over, which is a pain. Also not the best thing when playing in co-op. It‚Äôs frustrating, but I guess it‚Äôs a small price to pay for greatness. A large price to pay for greatness? A medium sized price.
Overall, wonderful game. Definitely recommend.",4
"So my best friend is OBSESSED with Genshin Impact. She had been telling me for a while to download it. It looked fun so I thought it was worth a shot. 3 days ago I downloaded it.  
But, after I finished making my account it brought me to a screen that said I didn‚Äôt have enough storage. I have the standard 5gb but only 2.5gb were used. So I looked it up and found out the game requires 12gb of storage. So I bought 50gb of storage which is more than enough. Unfortunately when I went to the app it said I still didn‚Äôt have enough space to download the full version. I deleted it and reinstalled it but it was the same thing. I watch TONS of videos but nothing seemed to work. Also my phone is pretty new (iPhone 12). I tried to play the non-full version. It was very fun and I could see why people love it so much. Eventually though it told me the only way I could continue playing was to download the full version. So I clicked on it and it brought me to the same ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have enough storage‚Äù screen. That was yesterday and I still haven't got it to work. I‚Äôm really disappointed not only because I bought all that storage for it to not work, but also because I REALLY want to continue playing this game. Please tell me if there‚Äôs a reason for this!",2
"The hate and backlash this game is receiving at the moment is absolutely shameful and have absolutely nothing to do about the beauty of this game. It‚Äôs a shame that I call myself a part of this greedy and toxic fandom. The company owes us nothing to give us major rewards for a year anniversary. This should be a moment of joy for Mihoyo and instead they are receiving hateful comments and reviews by greedy players looking for a handout. 

This game is absolutely gorgeous to be able to play for free. Lovely graphics that are pleasing to the eye (and I should know! I get chronic migraines yet I haven‚Äôt gotten one while playing yet), enjoyable fights, gorgeous cutscenes (a few that I have even cried at), and an awe inspiring story behind it all. And guess what? This game isn‚Äôt even finished yet. Only three of seven regions have been released with more content and more story to be discovered. I would highly recommend this game to anyone, those who like to play for free, or those who pay to play. 

Ignore the hate and give this game a shot. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fall in love with the lore and characters.",5
"PC player here. I played this game when it released and did not follow the story at all, just explored. I got bored of the game really quickly doing this, but a week or two ago my friend told me to get back on, i forgot my account details and made a new account and i ended up getting ar 25 in 2 days. The games story is just so addictive, id find myself saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get off after this quest,‚Äù and i would end up playing deep into the night sometimes even skipping meals. Then i went on vacation with my family leaving my computer at home, i then remembered that genshin has a mobile version which ive been using to perfect my characters artifacts and do commissions (in my freetime ofc i wouldnt ignore family). Most mobile versions of games usually turn me off of the game in general like pubg, minecraft, and though i‚Äôm ashamed to say i played it... fortnite, but genshin mobile has only made my interest in the game skyrocket seeing as i can improve my collection constantly even when i cannot reach my computer. Great game and its worth the 4 gigabytes out of my 32 that it takes up.",5
"I love Genshin it is one of my favorite games, but there are a few problems with it. First of all the biggest problem is resin. Most of the important resources required to progress are locked behind Resin. The problem with this is that it RECHARGES SO SLOW! It takes 8 minutes to obtain 1 resin. So to get 5 resin you would need to wait 40 minutes! And that‚Äôs only a 1/4 of the resin you need to obtain anything! Second of all primogems. This is a gacha game. And primogems are essentially the material you need to do ‚Äúpulls‚Äù and use the gacha system. Mihoyo starves us on these. We get about 2 ‚Äúpulls‚Äù per 3 week event and 1/3 of a pull each day (for doing daily quests). That‚Äôs it. Sorry to go on a rant. I gave it  four stars because honestly I enjoy this game. It‚Äôs not bad by any means, but these issues are pretty big If you wanna enjoy the game long term.

Extra: If you spent money (which not many are willing to do) you can somewhat get around these problems. Buying the battle pass for 10:00 dollars can give you massive amounts of resin locked resources (this can require a lot of grinding though ).And welkin blessing can give you a massive amount of primogems for its 5 dollar cost.",4
"First off this game is amazing! I have been playing since day 1. This game has loads of things to do for newer players. It‚Äôs an open world gacha game. This game is amazing because you get to explore around the world and fight enemies, there‚Äôs also an amazing storyline. Of course like all gacha games though, in order to get all the characters you want being a f2p can be hard. Genshin constantly has new content. But there are some downsides for those who really want to get into genshin. First off the fan base can be really toxic, please don‚Äôt listen to them and play the game however you like. Second of all this game requires a lot of downloading and storage if your device can‚Äôt handle tons of data I don‚Äôt recommend this game. Also the gacha system and the way of getting the ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù to pull for characters is a bit annoying. There is a pity but if you are planning on being a f2p the chances of constantly getting the characters you want is difficult. Overall though this is an imagining game that is rarely dry of content. I promise once you get into genshin you‚Äôll love it.",5
"Ok, right of the bat, I don‚Äôt like Japanese styled games. I‚Äôm just not a fan of the art. But one thing I love is Breath of the Wild legend of Zelda. BOTW is a Japanese game at its heart but has kind of American graphics. It is my favorite game of all time. But, this game...... is exactly like BOTW but Japanese and mixed with the new hyrule warriors. You can switch people but it‚Äôs still you. You can glide. Sounds like the same world audio, (like the grunting of climbing a mountain sounds the same in both games). It is not my favorite game, but my favorite mobile game. I would rather pick BOTW if I had to but, full disclosure, I actually don‚Äôt own BOTW but have deafened ganon multiple times with on my friends switch without any intervention, so I‚Äôve experienced the story, so i would recommend BOTW if you already have it but don‚Äôt want to pay and have the almost same experience this game is amazing and worth the 8 GIGS!! It takes to download. (READ HERE) But, I haven‚Äôt finished the story, not by a long shot, so the story may be good but I don‚Äôt know. The BOtW story was really good. But the story may be the turning point if you are into the story part of open world games.",4
"Overall, I‚Äôm very impressed with the quality of this game. The graphics are so beautiful, and it is very aesthetically pleasing whenever I play. There is a bunch of cool characters and an amazing storyline to play through. When I first downloaded Genshin Impact I was skeptical, and didn‚Äôt really know what it was. Now, after only a few days of playing, I am officially addicted. You can explore the map, battle monsters, collect cute, new characters, and complete quests to progress in the story. I am absolutely in love! However, there are a few small mistakes that the creators may have overlooked. At one point while summoning Dvalin, Paimon was talking to Lumine about her sister, when Lumine only has a twin brother. The game must‚Äôve thought that I was playing as the brother, but I wasn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs about the only mistake I‚Äôve found in the game, just pronouns. Otherwise everything seems perfect! I notice that the creators are frequently updating the game, which is always great to see. This game is by far my favorite RPG, and I would definitely recommend playing it. Thank you for creating this masterpiece! üíó",5
"So I got this game like a year ago and it‚Äôs still addicting! I play on mobile but it always works.(at least for me) no bugs! Honestly it‚Äôs the most successful RP gacha game I‚Äôve ever had! the graphics are AMAZING!!! Also if your a big collector (like me) there are so many awsome characters to get! I could name them all! It‚Äôs a bit hard starting off and trying to figure it all out but once you get it, it‚Äôs really fun! Your traveling companion, Paimon is very awsome! Paimon helps you kinda know what to do. And there is so much to explore! For example, all the different monsters and cats and dogs you can find! All the bosses too! And all the animals and humans have there own personalities! And the map is huge! You are free to explore at your own pace which helps lots of people! The story line-OMG it the best! All of the characters have their own voice and everything! So if your looking for a good Rp open world game, GET THIS ONE! (You won‚Äôt regret it!) It‚Äôs just the best game I have ever downloaded! And MIHOYO pretty much updates the game every 20 DAYS!! Don‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs not amazing! PS I love Paimon!!!!",5
"Genshin is my favorite game so far. Whenever I‚Äôm bored I like to play, and there‚Äôs a lot to do. I think all the mechanics in the game are great, and that only a few things need to be changed. I think that there should be more things that are similar to the abyss, since higher ranked players are unable to get primogems as easily. Also, with the weapon banner, it is annoying that the fate points don‚Äôt carry over after the banner changes. I think it should, since for F2P players it is harder to get primogems then those who spend money on the game. I also think that there aren‚Äôt enough year round 5 stars. There is a 50% chance you‚Äôll get the character on the event banner and a 50% you‚Äôll get 1 of 5 5 stars. There should be more, different 5 stars that are similar to the year round 5 (Jean, Diluc, Qiqi, Keqing, and Mona), there hasn‚Äôt been a new one for a while, and players that have been playing for a long while most likely have all of those characters already, along with constellations. Overall genshin impact is a really good game, and I highly recommend it to others.",5
"This open world game has been a gleeful experience and it has kept me busy for at least a year now this open game world isnt like any other games where its just one little area where everything is to easy and quick to complete or obtain u definitely have to work for stuff in this game the graphics are amazing the storyline is beautiful and the characters have amazing designs and each ones has there own backstory and quest this is definitely a game i would recommend to anyone! Great job thank you for ur work on this game mihoyo. New events are always coming out new characters,quest,enemies,and areas come out often too the wishing system in this. Game is great a little frustrating when u rlly what a certain character but it just makes u work harder for it five out of five is what i would Give this game every time thank you for a alp that i didn't get bored With in 20 mins looking forward for the future of this game <3 the chat features kinda annoying with the clearing of the messages unwanted. I have been playing since version 1.3",5
"They went an entire year without buffing electro element and starting with update 2.0 they‚Äôve begun treating the players like nothing but money bags and have been actively gimping newer characters because they think people will just take their wallets out anyway, this has CONTINUED in 2.1 where the newest archon is a joke and her element is still incredibly mediocre. And as for the anniversary rewards? Despite the billions they‚Äôve made in a year the most they could manage to give the players in return is a 10 pull (from logging in for 7 days mind you) and a sad amount of gold and xp crystals, they quite simply don‚Äôt care or value the players anymore now that they game has blown up and it‚Äôs incredibly disappointing. 

The game continues to suffer from a lack of replayability and despite a years worth of feedback on the resin system and there being literally nothing to do after completing the one and done story stuff, they‚Äôve refused to add anything permanent that isn‚Äôt heavily limited while flat out ignoring criticism and feedback about the weaker characters which has unironically CONTINUED into 2.0 since launch, 3 characters in a row have been garbage now while older ones who have always been weak remain untouched.",1
"I absolutely love this game! It is absolutely fun and I never see myself getting bored. The graphics and character design are beautiful, there is so much attention to detail and a lot of stories to hear from the NPCs. 

However, I am AR 44 and I don‚Äôt have many 5-star characters. I only have Mona, which I am fine with but I don‚Äôt use her a lot. I am also an F2P, meaning that I don‚Äôt spend money on this game. I feel like players who pay for stuff in the game have a higher advantage than those who don‚Äôt pay to play this game, especially on the wishing banners where the chances of getting a 5-star character are slim unless you have a lot of primogems and fates.

I‚Äôm not asking for much but to just increase chances of getting a 5-star in one 10-pull or at least make it more fair for those who don‚Äôt have the money to spend it on the wishing system. Perhaps you can decrease the amount of primogems needed for one intertwined/acquaint fate or make it more easy to gain primogems, because from someone who is broke, I can‚Äôt get 5-stars and I don‚Äôt have the best luck at this game.",5
"Getting this game was a horrific experience, and that‚Äôs putting it- who am I kidding, it wasn‚Äôt that horrible, but I‚Äôm not kidding when I say it took me two years to get this game. My journey began in the summer of 2020, when I decided to get the game for the first time, on my IPad. It worked, but the data requirement was‚Ä¶ well, I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it. My second experience was‚Ä¶ I think it was in fall of 2021? I tried to get it on my iPad, and I tried to get it on demo mode. Somehow, it failed. Finally, more recently in September. I did the demo mode, and finished it. And finally, I tried using my computer, failed miserably, and realized I need a PC. Since my dad has a PC, I use it to play Genshin. Definitely a five star worthy game, I have a few opinions about Dragonspire and adventure ranks, but that‚Äôs not why I give this game a four star review. It‚Äôs because of my horrific two year experience of trying to play it. Ok, I believe that‚Äôs it, and- oh right, I should also say I really need to work on Estebere, not the NS one, but the fantasy one I personally wish to make a book. Oh, it appears I‚Äôm rambling, so I believe I should gooooooooooo-",4
"I was just a beginner at the time and I kept getting lost and wondered how my luck was so low and that‚Äôs when I watched tuts and how to improve and now I have the new character YAOYAO  and more! This fantasy game is so worth the download and time into the full version! I play this 24/7 on my bed everyday and it gets so fun when you can actually go on missions, I think this is my favorite fantasy game out of all of them! I couldn‚Äôt download this game because of storage but when I got the storage to download it again I immediately logged into my old account to see how and where I was. I wasn‚Äôt doing so great but it gets so much fun after a few days! but one thing I would add is that theirs in and out glitches during the game, sometimes it randomly crashes and it could happen because of bad internet but it gets better if your on hotspot because it‚Äôs your personal internet and you can share it with Genshin and the crashes will barley happen anymore. Anyways. THIS IS SO WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!! I recommend so badly if you like fantasy games, thank you <3",5
"So when I first heard about it and that it was free I checked it out played it for a little then the next day I played for a long time and I noticed I never really got addicted to these kind of games but somehow this game manage to be super good then others and I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs free because of how good the game is! I started getting into the thoughts of other people starting rumors about a certain character and all that and it got more interesting the more I played it, I told my cousin about and she downloaded it then her dad did then her cousin Eva did then her grandma and they all enjoy the game though I wish that we didn‚Äôt have to be such a high rank to join friends but overall I love everything! I highly recommend this game to people who love adventure but chill vibe to a game, I love how we can choose our gender as well! I love Venties style and I feel he looks so cute! Thanks for making this game possible ü•∞ Thank you for your effort and time into the game everyone sure does appreciate the hard work put into this gameü´∂ Love Olivia‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Genshin Impact has long been known as a money grab. Sure, it is monetized in many ways, but as a free to play player, I find it easy enough to get by. People have been very unhappy with the update and anniversary lately, but for me, they were getting more than they deserved. The people complaining that the game is trying to take all their money are also mad about the anniversary, which literally handed them intertwined fates when they logged in! Intertwined fates are the very thing you spend your money on. Some players just cannot be satisfied. So, here is a completely unbiased opinion:
Genshin Impact is a very balanced game. It can be confusing near the beginning, with its many monetary systems, but eventually, it all makes sense. The game doesn‚Äôt crash unless your phone is too old, and graphics are very well done. The only problem is the player base. The community is, for the most part, pretty nice. Of course, there are always haters. Try to form your own opinion. Don‚Äôt listen to the haters. Don‚Äôt listen to me. Just download the game for free and give it a shot for a week or two. You can drop it later. It won‚Äôt hurt you.",4
"Hello. I‚Äôm new to the game but I can give you a good rundown of how it‚Äôs going so far (2nd release day). So far, I do have to say that the graphics/visuals and the audio as well are amazing! At first I had trouble loading the beginning cut scenes, but after that, I never had trouble with lag our audio glitches. The visuals are bright and beautiful, much better than most games out there currently. Now as for the gameplay itself, I am a newbie to this game, but it focuses mostly on grinding levels for many different characters and completing many different quests across the large world map. I love running across the map and not having to stop for any loading screens, it‚Äôs all one big world!

Now there is something for the developers to work on, as this is rated four stars and not five. As in many other reviews, there are many, many times where I will just be playing and either the screen will freeze or the game will completely crash. That gets quite annoying. 

Now I do understand that this is only the second day off of launch, so I will give them grace... hopefully they can fix the crashing issue, then I will rate it 5 stars!",4
"I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but this is a special occasion. I am a whale turned casual that has spent 10s of thousands over the years on dozen of different Gacha games and while all these games have had their good and bad aspects about them all respected and went all out for the anniversary. No matter how well or bad your Gacha is received and doing the anniversary was also event/celebration you as the company/dev gave back to the fanbase/community that supports, spends and plays your game and Mihoyo and Genshin have pretty much spat at that concept. From lackluster rewards that is equivalent to one multi summon after you log in for 7 days, to collecting 20 primo for having 15 ppl click on your ‚Äújourney link‚Äù to having a chance to win 100k Moro and one resin refill. These rewards if you want to call them that is beyond lackluster and worse than that some are RNG based. It‚Äôs insane and laughably that this dev/company would offer this as some celebration for the community that has made them massively more wealthy and successful. This review will stay 1star until this is changed or addressed and furthermore bugs and QOL changes are finally announced for problems the community has been asking / complaining about for the better part of the year. What a complete joke this situation and this game as become.",1
"As a Genshin Impact player and lover, I adore all the features the game has. Although I would like to suggest one thing. Earlier in my Genshin experience, I started to love and learn all the characters the game offers, but it was a struggle for me to get the character(s) I wanted. I understand that every player can‚Äôt get the character(s)/items they want. And with that being said, I would like to suggest a Trading system where all the players can trade character(s)/items/etc. At a certain Adventure Rank, players are able to trade items as the same value. A character for a character, an Item for an Item, you get what I mean. If the person that has the desirable Item (say a Character) and the other person does not have a character that the other person wants, they should be able to trade in the same amount of values as the Character such as, Artifacts, Weapons, Food, Wishes, and etc. I have been thinking about this feature a lot lately and all of my friends that are also players think it would be a great feature as well. just a little suggestion :)",5
"Okay so i‚Äôm gonna cut it short i love the game from the beginning to the new updates the game is beautiful and requires a lot of work obvi but i really hate the wishing system like i‚Äôve been saving up for a long time to *try* to get 1,600 primogems and what do i get for it? i get one 4 star. I say more characters well more 5 star characters should be on the standard banner like ones that have been in the game for so long but also the ones that have only gotten 1 re-run or none at all like klee. We also have requirements for certain things if you have the wrong people on the wrong team it‚Äôs useless to even pull for them. i say put a permanent event in the game like the mixing event with mondstat the job in my opinion should be permanent and on saturdays or weekends we should get maybe 20 or more primogems if we do it for the whole week. after a while of playing and waiting on events the game is pointless it get boring and tiring doing commissions are all the same it gets boring. Also, listen here not every character has to be white make them darker skinned darker not mixed not tan DARKER PLEASE.",4
"First the general gameplay is awesome and the game is explained to you through story quests and you at first do 5 different quests to get 3 other starter characters apart from Lumine or Aether whom you already have chosen from the beginning and you can go on quests to get primogems which help on your road to discover new characters which you do by wishing. Yes you do get some free characters along the storyline but the main characters come from standard wish banner, character event wish banners, and weapon banners. This game may seem like it is not free roam but it truly is and there is an absolutely gigantic map that you can unlock teleport waipoints and statues that can heal when you‚Äôre near them you can play in different regions with Archon Quests and that‚Äôs how you can unlock inazuma which is so beautiful. There is so much to learn about this game and I‚Äôm not usually that one to play complicated games but I found it‚Äôs so fun to play when bored! Download this guys! You won‚Äôt regret it and the game explains itself. I forgot to mention there‚Äôs co-op st a certain level!",5
"This game is amazing. The graphics are magnificent, and the playstyle and storyline is beautiful. What a well thought-out game. This cures my boredom, but I do want to recommend some things. For players adventure rank 45 and up, there should be special features and quests popping up everywhere. There isn't much to do after hitting ar 45, except for a potential event or archon quest coming out rarely. Another request is  for ar 60 players; once hitting adventure rank 60, you should be able to pick any five star character or weapon of your choice, whether it be an event five star or a standard five star, and maybe a set of ten intertwined fates for wishing. Hitting AR 60 is a big deal, because it takes so long. Another recommendation is similar - at adventure rank 30, halfway through, you should be able to pick any four star (character or weapon) of your choosing, and five aquient fates for the standard banner. I'm sure this has been requested a lot - but it would be amazing and have many more people play instead of hitting AR 35 and quitting. Thank you for reading this!",5
"This game has a very good story line for those who like to know the story of the game, it has a large map with treasures and games all over the place, the enemies are diverse and many for those who are here for combat, and has an awesome gatcha system for those who like that. The gatcha system has weapons from 3-5 stars on the weapons and standard banner, and characters from 4-5 stars on the character banner and standard banner. On the character banner, you are given a 50/50 chance of getting the featured character or getting a standard character. If you get a standard character, the next 5 star is the featured character. On the weapons banner, you have a 50/50 chance of getting your selected weapon or getting any other weapon. Once you fail twice you get the one you want as your next 5 star. It‚Äôs overall a great game for anyone, and it has great music for everything, so if you‚Äôre worried about the large amount of storage it takes up, think about all the things you can do with this game!!!",5
"To say that this game is addictive is a HUGE understatement. The graphics are beautiful and the story is very engaging and interesting (for the main storyline). There are a lot of small details in every character‚Äôs design that make you stop and think. However, as good as this game is, being f2p is EXTREMELY difficult. They are very stingy with rewards to their players. A single wish cost 160 primogems, but for those who have finished exploring and such, you can only earn 60 primos a day through daily commissions. This alone wouldn‚Äôt be so much of an issue if it weren‚Äôt for the limited amount of time on wishing banners. After the banner ends, the five star character is unobtainable unless MhY decides to give them a rerun. On top of this is the 90 wishes. Considering you can get about one wish every two days, 90 is far out of reach for older players. MhY being stingy with their players is nothing new. We saw it with the rewards given for the 1 year anniversary and we saw it again with how fast the primogem codes expired from the newest livestream. The codes expired in less than 24 hours. I know personally I was working during the livestream, so when I got home to watch the recording, I was disheartened to learn that the codes had already expired. Not all of us can drop everything for MhY sake.",1
"I never thought I‚Äôd play Genshin Impact as much as I do now. It was always something I scrolled by or saw other people hyping up and didn‚Äôt really think it was all that great. I clearly stand corrected as I‚Äôm almost adventure rank 40 and I‚Äôve caught up on all the archon quests. I started back in May but then fell of it. Then I really picked it up late august to September. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs excellent progress! I wish there was a feature that let you reclaim resources and materials used on characters you don‚Äôt really play with anymore though. Like you could get back all the mora you spent for ascension and upgrading your character as well as whatever was needed to ascend and upgrade, that would be really cool and save on some of the grindiness if that makes sense. I‚Äôm all for grinding but when I‚Äôm low on resources and can only get so far collecting, I‚Äôd like to be able to reset a least played character back to level one and use their materials to upgrade a main character that I play with constantly. Just some food for thought, everything else about this game I‚Äôm in love with!!",5
"Still not sure how they made this a mobile game. Pretty much a free to play breath of the wild. The graphics are breathtaking and somehow the game still runs really well on my iPhone 8plus. The world is huge and being added to as I am writing this review. There is so many small side quests, puzzles, and objectives. The world is well done and the small treasures you find just feeds your brain dopamine and you can‚Äôt stop. The main story itself is alright with nice animations and cut Scenes. The game play itself is also really fun with a pretty neat combat system.

There are some downside with this game. If you binge play this game (like 40hr/week) you will likely run out of things to do within 2-3 weeks and then have to wait for the new map expansion. There will still be things to do during that time but definitely not enough to keep you playing at your 40 hour/ week  pace. But if you take things slow and investigate/explore the world as you slowly progress the main story and not rush and binge play you will have high quality entertainment for a long time.",5
"The game is ridiculously beautiful, there‚Äôs no mistaking there‚Äôs a lot of effort put into this, alongside the top tier Japanese voice actors. The designs, world, all of the exploration aspects are very detailed and it‚Äôs a very good open world. However I have a bit of concern that from the Wish rates this game will turn into a pay to win, with the abysmal drop rate. Granted, you can get characters from progressing with the story, however, there‚Äôs no denying that there is this feeling that you can just cruise early and be ridiculously op from the start, it can break a hardworking player‚Äôs spirit, and hopefully the devs will take this into consideration, and make sure that all players will be given equal satisfaction so that whale players can still be whales and free to play players don‚Äôt feel like their hard work becomes obsolete. I feel this game has a very good potential and it would be a waste to see the joy ruined by a pay to win, since the team really put a lot of effort into this game. Personally I don‚Äôt mind giving support to the devs by making small purchases now and then, but I‚Äôd rather not have my hard work flushed down the drain just because the game says ‚Äúpay to win, baby‚Äù.",3
"Hi! i absolutely adore this game! it has amazing graphics, diverse characters, and super fun and challenging quests. It feels so good to just sit down and play after a long day. this game has given me so much joy since i downloaded, and i don‚Äôt regret doing so at all. the only thing i would say is if you want to download genshin, you have to be willing to sacrifice some other apps on your phone for storage purposes. this game is amazing, but for it to be as enjoyable as it is, it uses lots of storage. and as someone who doesn‚Äôt have the most storage on my phone, it‚Äôs been a little challenging picking and choosing what i keep and what has to go. not at all blaming the game makers, it‚Äôs an amazing game and i would 100% recommend, just warning people with low storage that it takes a LOT of storage to be able to play and regularly update this game. overall, it‚Äôs an amazing game and one of my personal favs, but it‚Äôs also a big commitment (storage-wise) i‚Äôve really enjoyed playing this and i hope anyone who downloads it can enjoy it too! üíóüíó",5
"With the addition of controller support this game is now the best thing on the app store. You can play this game as little or as much as you like. There is no energy system outside of resin to just play. You can play 100% for free. Although you will likely never see a 5* character. And they are very strong. There is also no sign of Venti or Klee in the game which is very disappointing. I stopped playing the game because of no controller and now i have lost my chance to acquire 2 of the best characters. But even without those 2 or a 5* character the game is just amazing. Huge open world at console quality, lots of events, crafting, boss fights, co-op and a growing character roster. This game proves what ios gaming could truly be.

 The only reason it is 4* is because 5* is reserved for perfect. And underneath it all this is still a gacha game with elements that can really only be unlocked with cash. Im all for giving you 60 bucks for a game and even buying expansion packs that include new characters and areas. To ask people to spend 100‚Äôs for a .06% chance to get a character or item is the most insane thing. Luckily this game is still enjoyable without using the gacha system.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for about a year and a half, I first downloaded back in December 2020. As time went on, and updates passed, I enjoyed the game as it was‚Äî but it soon became a major storage issue for my phone, taking up almost 70 gigabytes of extra file storage. Genshin is originally marketed as a PC game, so I understand why PC players may not have those issues and continue to play freely, but because of my storage, I had to delete the application in order to software update my phone. Will I redownload it? Perhaps on a tablet, or something that can handle the amount of files, since I really do enjoy the game. I just wish there was a way that the mobile phone version was able to take up less space and still be the amazing game it is today.

Overall this makes me disheartened, because I was looking forward to Ayato‚Äôs banner and saving for it, but I can‚Äôt do anything about it until I free up more storage (somehow) or find another device to play it on (which makes me grateful for the cross-platform for Mobile-iPad-PC. I have c1 level 80 Raiden and a level 90 Venti! Which is a big deal to me, since I‚Äôm not really much of a grinder).",3
"This would be a great game if it was not for the totally crappy wish system that is used to obtain new characters and weapons. Early on you get a lot of characters, but that tapers off around chapter II.  Players end up investing a ton of time earning primogem in order to buy fates,  just to get crappy duplicate weapons or the same characters over and over. It is really flawed and disappointing.  Once my characters were between level 50/60, I spent 70 wishes over a two week period and did not get one new character. 
Also never received a 5 star weapon from  any of the wishes the entire time I played. I had to forge and level up any weapons that were worth having, like the dragonspine spear, which is a ridiculous process (like the gae bolg in final fantasy 14). So disappointing. I even dropped wishes during promotional periods where the drop rate was up too. Nada. 
At a certain point you need more characters to progress and they just don‚Äôt drop. You can run the abyss for big primogem hauls but once that is done, you have to look elsewhere. This is to the point where the game is no longer enjoyable to play.  Developers are just hoping players get impatient and spend real cash for additional primogem. No thanks. Fix the character drop rate, get  rid of the stupid gamble, and this could be a great game.",1
"I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but this game blew me out of the water. I‚Äôve been playing rpgs for years and I never stick with one for more than a couple weeks, but I‚Äôm so captivated by the sheer amount of things to do and detail in this game there‚Äôs never a dull moment. The character design is insanely detailed, there‚Äôs not a single undynamic character. You‚Äôd think with the amount of npc‚Äôs  there‚Äôd be many that you can‚Äôt talk to; but every single one I‚Äôve encountered tells you paragraphs of actually interesting story that is going on in this persons life. You can even go find the family members that they‚Äôre talking about and fawning over in their dialogue, and they‚Äôll share with you the other side of the story. It looks like breath of the wild for gods sake!

It‚Äôs a gorgeous game, with a gorgeous community to match. Mihoyo  is a wonderful company from what I‚Äôve seen and I adore their work on this game. It‚Äôs easy to drown in the serotonin you get from this game, so be careful! 

I highly recommend it, my favorite game to date on pc and mobile.",5
"for context, this is coming from an Adult hardcore player in the 'late' game who's spent over $500 USD in a year period. I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to spend any kind of money in this game, I will explain why...
GI it's a great concept for a game in itself, being managed by the worst company I've seen in my gaming history, yes I see you MIHOYO! Best way to describe them: a greedy, anti-consumer, and misleading corporation. 
This game is geniously designed for two types of players, 1. Casual free to play and 2. Heavy spenders in the thousands of dollars. This game is not catered for us hardcore players who spend lightly on a monthly battle pass. There's literally no grey area. At the start of the game you are overwhelmed my the amount of content, it gives the impression of a full on RPG game with plenty hours of gameplay, but there comes a threshold we call the 'late' game when there's nothing to do! it is literally 30min of daily grind. Unfortunately content updates are not substantial enough for hardcore players to be entertained for long.  So back to the original idea, you will have a great time with this game in two scenarios, if you don't spend any money (zero) and not rush through the content, or on the other hand you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars so you can refresh the in-game 'currency' used for the gated content.",1
"To start: This has NOTHING to do with the anniversary.

When the game starts it‚Äôs amazing, so much to explore, and the game feels endless. The memories this game have given me and so many others are nothing short of magical. If Genshin wasn‚Äôt live service, this would be an easy 4.5/5 for sure. But it‚Äôs not. This game has the worst returns for real life time that I‚Äôve ever seen. 8 minutes for 1 resin. With that you can less than 1 level on your weapons. 1 hour and 20 minutes for nothing. A domain is 20 resin (2hrs 40min) for 1 bad 5star artifact, or a minimal amount of talent/weapon ascension material. Then there‚Äôs the expeditions. 20 real hours for items that could be easily obtained within 20 minutes of casual play. And the Adventure rank system‚Ä¶ pathetic. The months of effort and time to rank up ONCE past 55 earns you the i game equivalent of pennies. The fact that none of these changes - or those that have been brought up by the playerbase numerous times - have not even been acknowledged is disturbing. Especially for a game that is constantly updated. I love the memories this game has given me and for them I am thankful. But I can never and will never recommend this game to ANYONE, for how poorly it responds to the community.",2
"This game is by far one of my favorite open world mobile games! With all the details, fantastic voice acting, the scenery, everything is perfect! I‚Äôve played maybe 10 minutes so far and I‚Äôm already hooked. I gave the creators many hints with a tweet and feedback saying this game would be amazing if it had controller compatibility. I don‚Äôt want my fingers all over my screen covering all the beautifully crafted visuals! I really do hope they add controller compatibility to mobile or just put it on Xbox one please!

But, I know I‚Äôve only played 10 minutes and I‚Äôm already writing a review. The reason why is because I‚Äôve played multiple MMOs and open world games. The first 5 minutes literally got me hooked because of how they executed the intro. And not even that, the small details in the game like climbing trees to get to higher up fruit! The voice acting is amazing, and the characters are so far adorable, even the monsters! I can‚Äôt say to much because I haven‚Äôt played an hour or two yet, but this game is definitely worth playing if you‚Äôre a huge ‚ÄúSkyrim‚Äù like person! (Cause I am)",5
"I have always wanted to play a Massive open world game on my phone. It‚Äôs been years of searching for games on the App Store and I found a few games that were good, but they were not exactly the kind of game I was looking for. I was looking for a game where you have freedom instead of following a single storyline, I was looking for Amazing graphics in a game, and I was looking for something that is long and satisfying. This game has gone way past my expectations, from graphics, to gameplay, to story/side quest, to exploring freely. There‚Äôs just so much to do, I look forward to playing more and getting new updates to add even more improvements. Keep up the good work! (Also a few suggestions to make it better, Add more side quest that has some useful rewards maybe, and maybe a friendship or couple system to make it more realistic; like more interactions throughout the game, most likely with online people, oh and one more thing; even more characters and weapons which will draw more people on as well as keep players playing for who knows how long) thank you.",5
"This game keeps you involved and interested! Their updates and new quests keep it interesting and a challenge! My only complaint is how hard it is to advance levels, weapons, talents etc the higher you have your characters and AR. Much Higher rewards for higher AR. Players put the effort into the game reward on that. The different characters to obtain are a lot of fun if you can get them. It is rather difficult to obtain 5 star characters unless you pay for unlimited primogems. I think the pity should be a little more player friendly than money making. Not everyone can afford to play this game as they would like to! This should be equal among all. I think resin should increase with level advancement as well other leveling items! The higher AR the more Resin you can acquire in a day. The game is amazing and I play every day due to this reason, even though sometimes boring waiting for new areas, releases, etc. Much luv to the developers! You‚Äôve all put a lot of effort into this game. A few tweaks and it could keep people interested.",5
"I actually really enjoy this game! This is the first time i‚Äôve played a game like this, so it‚Äôs definitely challenging as well as a fun experience! Although, there are quite a few problems with co-op. 

Starting off, quite a few players haven‚Äôt been able to join their friends‚Äô worlds. When one requests to join their friends‚Äô world, the friend doesn‚Äôt receive a notification that someone is requesting to join their world. Secondly, when my friend joins my world, i‚Äôm suddenly not able to talk to the npcs. This is a huge hinderance since we want to do quests together! Even after my friend leaves and comes back, it still won‚Äôt work. As for me (since it‚Äôs my world), it takes me quite a few times to leave and come back to get the npcs to work again! Lastly, there should DEFINITELY be more co-op story quests available. As to my knowledge, there are no co-op story quests, which is a bit heart breaking. 

I want to enjoy having fun with my friend with not only world quests (which we rarely get to do since the npcs don‚Äôt work during co-op), but with story quests too! I genuinely hope the creators take not of the reviews from the players so we can all have a fun time.",4
"For the amount of time I have been playing this game I have come to realize that it isn‚Äôt really intended for mobile device users. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the design of the game is amazing! You really feel like you are living in a fantasy world, the music and landscape are wonderful. Though, I have been continuously having the problem of the game just not loading. I have to keep closing and reopening the app to be able to proceed, otherwise I will spend 3 minutes at a black screen with fantasy music playing. That may not sound so bad, but 75% of the time I am trying to play the game I encounter this problem. So warning to mobile users, beware of this problem and not just dive in immediately. Consider using a PC if you have one. I should also tell you that it does not just impact the amount of time it loads, but it also takes away from the amazing animation. You end up just staring at the beginning of it and hearing the scratchy noises of the narrator of that animation.

Then again, this game is amazing! I totally recommend playing it. The characters that you meet are very easy to get attached to and there is no shortage of quests.",4
"Apple store editors choice and well deserved. A flagship title for the appstore and an amazing game all around, have yet to find an aspect about the game i don‚Äôt like. it‚Äôs jam packed with hours upon hours of exploration, quests, it‚Äôs regularly updated and not pay to win. large open world games like this are especially hard to come by and for a ios/android title it really sets the bar high. it‚Äôs got plenty of mechanics in place to keep you intrigued and wanting to go out and complete quests to level up your characters or their gear. 

the only reason i deducted a star is because of the lack of customization, a must have in any open world RPG. there‚Äôs no character creation, no special moves to choose for the characters you have unlocked, and not even outfits. the closest thing the game has to customization is changing your glider. not to mention the glide function had a lot more potential than it was given

Don‚Äôt let that negative aspect ruin your experience however, it‚Äôs still honestly even trumps some console and PC games in my opinion and i believe anyone who avidly or even casually games on their pocket device should try it out.",4
"Overall, this game is stunningly beautiful and the game mechanics are well thought out and in depth compared to even most AAA titles. However, where this game falls short is the fast of how much it costs to be able to upkeep the game itself. If you are a person who gets dedicated to a game and wants to grind, this game might be too much you. The amount of investment to level a single character to maximum level will literally take months of daily grinding using the little bit of Resin they give you. The worst part of it all is it seems the developers realize this and refuse to change their flawed system that they have implemented on their players. The response to us not having enough Resin was met with an increased cap of Resin... but that doesn‚Äôt fix how long it takes to refill? Even without the Resin issue there still character tomes (xp) Imbalance issues, Mora income imbalance issues, heck even basic character xp issues from combat. I will reiterate that this game is beautiful and a blast to play but for long term investment it just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it. For now it will take my spot for the Gacha that I play but will be looking for other games to take its place as the grind is far too great.",3
This is one of the best games I‚Äôve played in years. Yesterday I spent almost 8 hours playing. I starting reading the reviews and saw a minor trend. Some people were saying they experienced graphic and audio lag and black spots. I‚Äôm using the iPhone 11 Pro Max and experience no issues. It‚Äôs the most graphically stunning game I‚Äôve ever played on a phone. So if you if don‚Äôt have some power under the hood of your phone it may be difficult for you. With that being said this game is so refreshing. It breaks the static mold of mobile gaming today. It‚Äôs so underwhelming playing the same card based energy consumption model over and over that unoriginal developers have been using for years. Baffling how they seem to believe that we enjoy our games all playing the same with the same inherent limitations. Surely they must play games themselves. With the power that phones and tablets can come with today finally a developer has started utilizing it. Hopefully this is a turning point and other developers will see this creating a new model for mobil gaming. Thank you miHoYo for this epic creation!,5
"I honestly kinda had high hopes for this game when i downloaded it because i watched some game plays about the game But it didn‚Äôt turn out well, This game is going to need major bug fixes for the mobile before doing anything else with the game like updates and so on. And i know i should play on the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù version of the iPhone but you cant expect people to go out and buy some expensive phone just to play some lame game. 
For more the opening of the game is my first impression. I just ended up with a nice headache because i used headphones. The audio was.. like all scratched up or, i don't know how to put this and the animation or video or.. whatever you want to call it was stopping non stop. The only smooth part of it was the character picking and picking your name. Then once i finally loaded up i was surrounded with darkness, that made it really uncomfortable. 
I‚Äôll still and try to play the game and might leave another review. all i want is the mobile experience for ALL versions of the iPhone to be improved and not just the iPhone i want all the different platforms experience to improve if ey are having this same problem 

And sorry if this sounds all weird, random or doesn‚Äôt sound right. I don't have the best English.",2
"This game is really the best game on both sides. It has an amazing story line, as well with rewarding with primogems, it‚Äôs amazing graphics, and it has good bosses to fight. It's nice how everything you do is an adventure, and the voice actors did really well. The gacha is balanced because it does take a while to get a 5 star character (which sadly, I haven‚Äôt gotten yet after playing for around 3 months from now) but the happiness of getting a 5 star character is well worth the wait. Also, there is this system that the game gives you a 5 star pity if you haven‚Äôt gotten a 5 star yet and you have to do 90 wishes to do so. Well that being said, everything in this game is really wrapped up and is beautifully and well executed. If you haven‚Äôt played this game yet, what is wrong with you (no offense.) I hope more people play this game because this is probably the best FREE GAME ON THE APP STORE!! Also, the updates are constantly happening and the updates are well worth the wait too. I wish for all genshin impact players good luck on their adventure of getting a 5 star character!!!!",5
"I really love the game and I‚Äôm enjoying it quite a lot. It‚Äôs really a fun game and I like the variety of missions that you can do as well as the characters in the game. I especially enjoy the characters the most. My only complaint on the game is that I‚Äôve noticed that when you choose to play as the male traveller the characters you interact with still refer to you as female when voiced but the captions do refer to you as male. So I would like to see that resolved in a future update, if possible. I like that I was able to choose the gender of my character giving it a RPG feel to the game which I really love. However,  I‚Äôm not fond of how because I didn‚Äôt select the female character the voices of the characters I interact with don‚Äôt follow the dialogue of the game captions so I‚Äôll hear them calling me a girl or hear them say ‚Äúhope you find your brother‚Äù but when I read the dialogue I‚Äôll be reading the opposite. The upside is that I‚Äôve noticed that Paimon seems to get the genders right so at least my travel companion doesn‚Äôt refer to me as the wrong gender. Lol.",5
"I love the game, I enjoy most everything about it. I just can‚Äôt play it a lot because of logistical reasons. It takes up about 50% of my storage which wouldn‚Äôt be a huge deal except for the fact that I have couple other problems. I would maybe play more when I‚Äôm on the go, to and from places except that it gets really laggy, I understand that it‚Äôs a big game, but it is also laggy when I‚Äôm at home‚Ä¶ The game also drains my phone battery, which once again, I understand that it‚Äôs a large game,however, that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it isn‚Äôt very convenient for me. I do happen to have an Xbox though, and I do use one of my wireless controllers to play on my phone. It works just as well with my controller as with the touch commands. What I‚Äôm trying to say in a round about way is that you should put the game out on Xbox. That would fix all of the problems that I am having on mobile. Again, I do love the game, but it would be much better if I could just play it on my Xbox console because of the storage and the cleaner game play. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and I hope you have a great day.",3
"I love Genshin so much, but there are a few irks. The lack of melanin in characters is alarming.. and also the cultural appropriation. Not to mention the file space on mobile. As a mobile user myself, there were rumors or ‚Äúleaks‚Äù going around stating that come the 2.8 update players would be able to delete past files to free up storage. While I do not know if this was ever true or not, I wished it was. Sadly that rumor has been debunked and now Im deleting precious photos, videos, apps, and so much more just for this game. I would appreciate it if Genshin was just a little more mobile friendly :D. I would also like to see a change in character design and skin color. POC (People of color) characters have been scarce and if there are poc characters, theyre harmful stereotypes. It would be lovely to see POC characters increase amongst the other characters PROPERLY. Now, hoyoverse if you think melanin characters wouldnt make bank, youre wrong. I would love to pull for a POC 5 star in the game and see them with a proper design and playstyle that isnt harmful. Though tjere is a rise in melanin characters, theyre only NPCS. It would be much appreciated if they were the actual playable characters. But overall this game is a wonder. Truly plenty of space to explore, and lore to speak of. Really just lets your mind wander.",1
"Ill have to admit, I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of genshin when I first downloaded the app. I thought it was too hard and I could never rank up. But now, I find the game really fun! The places you can explore makes it better. Such as Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Dragonspine, Etc..But overall the story quests are amazing. I just redownloaded the game to try it again. I‚Äôm now Adventure Rank 24, and I‚Äôm trying to do the Liyue Archon quest. So good so far. Plus, every character has their own design. And with Ayato coming out soon, we‚Äôll be able to do more quests. The entire lore of this game is awesome! Venti, the Anemo God, also known as Barbatoes. Zhongli, the Geo God. And Raiden Shogun, the Electro God. All of the gods are 5star characters. You‚Äôre able to get good weapons and good characters as well. Such as Fischl. Fischl is a 4star Electro bow user. I used her to fight bosses all the time. The pity system is also great. The highest pity you can go up to to get a 5star character or weapon is 90. Not that bad, now is it? Overall, the game is amazing! If your looking for a fun RPG story game, this would be the one!",5
"How about add a pvp system or a multiplayer pvp system in game? 
Because some players like me likes this game about everything about it like the characters, graphics, the animals roaming around and we can actually make them our food oh and the mobs all over the map and also roaming around not like any other games I have ever played. But I feel like there is something missing, which is pvp. I love the game‚Äôs battle system where u can actually doge skills but we are only playing with NPCs which we can get use to because they are programmed to fight like how do fight. But pvp is gonna be a challenge or unpredictable of how the players move. I was think of a rank system where the more you win the higher and much harder players there will be and maybe a 1v1-4v4 match up? And the lobby will be you world and invite your friends on your lobby and start the match up while you are doing what ever you‚Äôre doing on the world then it will tell you to get ready when you are matched up with another then to you to another world/area.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for almost a year now, and the gameplay is fun, the story‚Äôs are good and the characters well written (mostly). My one problem is how pale they all are.  The darkest playable character in the game is Xinyan, and she hasn‚Äôt been given any black features other than her skin, and while she does have a little more melanin than the other characters, it isn‚Äôt right to excuse the colorism that is going on in this game. Almost all the characters are pale white or very very pale tan, including characters that are inspired by darker people (for example: Candace). People have talked about it many times but we never see the issue being addressed or solved. This is especially a issue because the regions (Monstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, etc;) are different regions where they should have different skin tones but don‚Äôt. In real life, Most people in Asia arent even pale white, but a mixture of tans, brown and blasian people, so why can‚Äôt this be shown in Genshin Impact? It would improve the game so much and there would definitely be more players if you actually listened to this. Please solve this issue because not just everyone in the world is pale.",3
"I love Genshin Impact I really do. I love the type of games where it‚Äôs an open world and you can do whatever and go wherever you want, I love those types of games. Genshin was really fun and addicting and well written in the beginning but as I started to play more, it seemed like there wasn‚Äôt really a storyline anymore. And if I wanted to continue the storyline I would have to grind my adventure level for like 30 minutes just to level up once. Mihoyo idk if you guys read your reviews but just update your game more instead of adding characters. Make the upgrading mechanic a little easier, maybe add other ways to upgrade. And I know a lot of people can agree with me on this one: add character customization please. Let us be able to customize our hair, skin tone, clothes, weapons, shoes all that stuff. The next time you update your game ADD CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION. Overall the game is pretty good. There are some minor downfalls but it‚Äôs really good. So I‚Äôm giving it 5 stars. Great job on the game Mihoyo but please just add some more stuff to the game.",5
"ive been playing genshin for over a year now and its great! i play nearly everyday and its all i do in my free time. however i do have some issues with it. its NOT free to play friendly at all. grinding for primogems (the gachas currency) can take WEEKS to be able to get enough for a ten pull if youre a late game player. you need at LEAST 90 pulls for a guaranteed 5star. i think this system would be pretty good for the players if it didn‚Äôt take 160 primogems for 1 wish, seeing as though opening one chest can give you anywhere from 2-10 primogems. another thing i have an issue with is the absolute massive amount of storage this game takes up. i play on both pc and mobile and its an issue with both platforms. this game takes up 20 GB so far, 1/3 of my total storage, AND ITS NOT EVEN FULLY RELEASED YET. the mobile player base will probably die out within this year because of how much storage this game needs. pretty soon ill have to buy another storage card for my pc because it‚Äôs almost filled. genshin is the only game i even play on the computer and its still a MONSTROUS amount. i think this game needs LOTS of improvement, but these are just my biggest critiques.",3
"This game is fantastic at the start. However the biggest turnoff is when you get closer you endgame, you‚Äôll see how this game is limiting you to build any character stats. Just like any other mobile game there is some type of energy system. Well this game has it, you are discouraged to keep continuing to upgrade your character as you have to wait or pay your way to grind. Grind? Did you hear that? The grind in this game is far worse than any other rpg I‚Äôve ever played. The energy system combined with RNG elements from getting the perfect drops for your character is insane. You can be grinding for months and still haven‚Äôt got the stats you want for one character. I‚Äôm currently suffering from burnouts endgame, mainly since I really can‚Äôt enjoy building my characters and lack of challenges. This game is predominantly story-focused and adventuring. You will find your self not challenged in the story. The only challenge in this whole game is an arena mode, called spiral abyss. Which you have to fight through 12 floors and rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs a pain to have RNG elements and energy system tied together. It‚Äôs a pain to catch limited events to farm a currency to roll on an another character. Mihoyo needs to do better, otherwise I can‚Äôt justify playing this game years to come.",1
"Yeah, I don‚Äôt give me wrong. I‚Äôm not hating on this game. It‚Äôs amazing the graphics are amazing. Everything about it is just high-quality and it would be really hard to make things like this but there are a few things that confuse me there‚Äôs a lot of things that they don‚Äôt teach you when you‚Äôre a beginner and then, as you get more skilled you find out these things that could‚Äôve helped you so much when you were a beginner and you could‚Äôve leveled up faster and it really annoys me about that because you could‚Äôve leveled up to adventure, rank like when you were like level 20 or something it‚Äôs also really cool to find new characters and all but the sword sometimes they‚Äôre not as good but this game is amazing either way, but once you get to a higher rank, it‚Äôs like the game is dying there isn‚Äôt any updates and it feels like it only comes like once a year when you‚Äôre a beginner there‚Äôs much more of things that you can do this motivates me to play it but either way this is amazing game. Hi tech quality is amazing. Love it keep up the good",4
"This game is so good I could lost so many good things about it. First of all the fighting part of the game is tons of fun. The fighting is just hard enough to not be impossible, also I like the different abilities you could have as different characters. One thing I‚Äôm confused about though when I play I look at the characters area and I see one of my unlocked characters says it‚Äôs I have a trial for it. You might have to fix that(unless it‚Äôs supposed to be like that). Another thing I love about the game is the adventures, you can go so many places to without running out of fun. It‚Äôs also a lot of fun to do the adventure quest ones where you have to go find the fight. The collection of differ things from chests and barrels is also super fun because you never know what you get. The cooking in the game is fun because then it‚Äôs easy to get health back but I feel like the cooking should be a little harder because it‚Äôs just time it right, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to do. 

This game is just so amazing I could keep on writing about so many different details. (It was worth downloading 5GB of space for this game)",5
"First things first, the graphics. Breathtaking! I experimented with the settings and the game is still pretty on the lowest graphics settings. Second, the story! From the games I‚Äôve played, the story is really unique and interesting! Plus there‚Äôs side stories that can distract you while helping you level up! Another thing I love about this game is the attention to detail. Like Barbara for example, she calls herself an idol and whenever she does her abilities in Mondstadt the people clap for her! That‚Äôs just an insane little detail that I appreciate. There‚Äôs also so many hidden secrets and Easter eggs that are so amazing too! Basically this game is so worth it. I may or may not have been playing for hours on end. Keep up the amazing work!!! I do have one quick suggestion for the devs that‚Äôs been annoying me during combat. Can there be a specific button for climbing? I‚Äôve been in combat a few times and suddenly my character starts climbing and it‚Äôs slightly stressful during boss fights. If you read this I hop you have an amazing day!",5
"I love this game! It has beautiful features and really good quest, weapons, and Characters, BUT! Whenever I try to pull for a character and I get a gold, Their I get‚Ä¶ A WEAPON!!! And im on a CHARACTER banner, trying to get Venti or something! But the fact that Genshin made it so that WEAPONS ESPECIALLY 5 STAR WEAPONS WHEN IM TRYING TO GET A 5 STAR CHARACTER!!! But 3 star weapons are understandable in the CHARACTER banner, but when ever I do get a pink/purple Pull or a golden pull, I almost NEVER get a 4 star or 5 star CHARACTER! So I ask of you Genshin! Please just make a update so that 5 star weapons AND MAYBE 4 star weapons MAYBE, can just stay on the WEAPON BANNER instead of interrupting the chance of getting a really cool 5 star character! So just make it so that 5 star weapons at least 5 star weapons TO STAY IN THE WEAPON BANNER, AND STAY OUT OF THE CHARACTER BANNER. Especially for people who have NO LUCK like me T-T its hard to get the good characters and its rare! Like for me I HARDLY GET CHARACTERS!!!! I only get weapons! And I dont think its fair to a bunch of people either! So again PLEASE fix this!!! Otherwise really great game
And i hope you continue to grow the game! Good luck and bye",4
"I would definitely game if you like RPG and action stuff. I started playing in March and the gameplay is amazing! But, there are some  problems with the game. #1. Wishing, Let‚Äôs be honest, We all hate losing a 50/50 to a character like Diluc, Jean, Qiqi, Keqing, Or Mona. I find it really annoying because I lost my 50/50 for Zhongli and Yelan. But at least I got a new character! #2. Graphics, I remember before I changed onto this iPad, The graphics were really low. Even with it all on high it would lag a lot and it was still low quality. This is the last problem. #3. A Volume glitch. So, on my old iPad there was a volume glitch where it suddenly didn‚Äôt work even though my volume in the settings was all on. I don‚Äôt know why it did that but it might have just been my iPad acting up. On my current iPad (This one) The volume is completely off unless I wear headphones. Again, it might just be my iPad. But other than those problems I think this is an amazing RPG game! I recommend this to all my friends! Great work!",5
"An incredible game that reminded both me and my friends of hits that came before, such as Breath of the Wild and Assassin‚Äôs Creed. 
I started the game on ps4, and quickly got it on all my devices. It still shocks me how a game that has such intense world building and story can be played simply from my phone. I was intimidated by the game at first, and all of its features, but quickly picked up the many fun controls and features. The game is a breath of fresh air for not just mobile games but the industry in general. A game thats free to play, has generous gacha mechanics that aren‚Äôt insanely impossible, and has such an immersive story is one sure to secure its place within gaming history. Each character, both exclusive to the story and events, have a history and a past, talents and themes that match who they are, and talented voice actors. Some of who you may recognize from other games (such as Ryuji‚Äôs VA from Persona5)! 

The game is so much fun and is worth the hype. There‚Äôs a reason why the internet and gaming communities in general went crazy for this title and it‚Äôs deserved!!",5
"Game play wise its alright they are some unfair advantages but it hasn‚Äôt bothered me so far, story line is alright too! The major con for me is the space and character designs I think we all know that some of the sumeru characters has been leaked some way or another and we cannot deny that they are horrible inaccurate here are list of the reasons I why I think so one, Most of them are light skinned when most if not all are supposed to be from middle eastern/south asian countries (I don‚Äôt know about Southeast Asia though) but the ‚Äúarchon‚Äù is so fair skinned and It just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me and like half of the fans if not all, my second reason is that they are some racist character designs to a character who I will not say as someone might be reading this and doesn‚Äôt want to get spoiled or anything like that all I could describe them best as I can their color scheme is pink it is just an outrages design and they do not know the difference they should have known and not have combined it together (I apologize for the lack of information but I don‚Äôt want this to go further than it already is)",4
"I love everything about this game.  The graphics and everything are good and the story(even though I‚Äôm not that into it yet, still a beginner).  All the characters are amazing and I‚Äôm still confused with how artifacts work but I‚Äôll understand sooner or later.  One thing I think would be coool to add to the game is to be able to do story quests again.  Like the quests you need to do to continue the story.  I think that it can work like a domain.  You do it again and you get a prize and or lose health if you finish.  I don‚Äôt think the prize should be that big considering we already did that quest.  I was thinking that it could be cool to see the cool animations from the quests again.  I know that many other players would like to experience the quests again. There could be a little slot in which we can access old quests that the player had finished.  They should also be sorted out just like the little quest thingy in the game that shows all our quests.  That‚Äôs all, bye! 

(I reread this and saw that I used the word ‚Äúquests‚Äù a lot haha)",5
"ive been playing genshin impact since xiaos banner (im ar 55), and one of my biggest issues is the resin system. i have to farm multiple times daily because i dont have enough resin (this is with fragile resin and transient resin) to farm for my characters ascension , their weapons , AND their talents. i have to farm talent level ups , weapon level ups , and heros wit + character ascension materials. i simply do not have enough resin to do all of those things without having to wait days at a time. i would also like to mention the horrible pity system , and the impossible to get primogems. theres a certain point in the game where its so hard to be f2p , and its easy to quit. it could take about a month for someone whos f2p to get just a simple 10 pull without help of events/updates/gamecodes. our anniversary rewards are a complete joke unless mhy has something planned. we got the same rewards for the lantern rite‚Ä¶im not ungrateful for the 10 fates i just wish there could be something more given to us as players. other than these issues i love the graphics , and i love the storyline. both are amazing and i wish i could replay a lot of the main/character quests ^^ i also really love the character designs they are really cute !",2
"It‚Äôs challenging on my iPhone 6‚Äìprobably because it‚Äôs a lower end device‚Äîbut it still runs and it‚Äôs fantastic on my laptop. It‚Äôs a free world RPG with magic, character building, a fun gacha component (that‚Äôs difficult to understand at first but easy to use for free when you figure it out), interesting world building and characters, and beautiful graphics and music. The first anniversary rewards *are* disappointing so far, but it‚Äôs truly not a big deal, and the recent 1 star reviews based on that are extremely embarrassing. 

The game is free, so just give it a shot if you‚Äôre not sure about it. Despite what the complainers cry about, the game is perfectly fun and playable without spending a dime. I would recommend not going through it too fast though‚ÄîI completed the first two regions very quickly and didn‚Äôt have much to do in terms of exploration or achievements before the next region was released, but major updates happen every 6 weeks, so if you pace your gameplay just right you won‚Äôt run out of content.",5
"It is up to personal preference but it is too much of storybook or movie for me. The gameplay it has is redundant collection, long walks to waypoints you usually don‚Äôt have yet type of games. It has tons of cutscenes and dialogue screens. It has a decent story but in my opinion it‚Äôs overbearing. Now I don‚Äôt want to narc on this game,  I liked the combat and characters I started playing Genshin the first week it came out. But I have just grown tired of the routine like gameplay. It has great graphics and the characters overall are likable. But backing up, the missions that aren‚Äôt story quests are usually the same old mission you have played 20x before. The side quest are long enough to be actual storylines themselves and the spacing of way points in is bothersome. They usually get you kind of close to where you are going. But some quests have you out where there is 30 minutes of climbing and no waypoint to avoid climbing forever. So if you are a story driven player this game is for you. but if you like unique fights you mostly face the same enemies. Cutscenes and run about missions throw you into the action then pull you right back out of it. I wanted to love Genshin but it just isn‚Äôt my game, not that it‚Äôs Mihoyo‚Äôs fault they can‚Äôt make everyone happy no matter how hard they try.",2
"My best friend brought me to her house and forced me to download this on my laptop. It‚Äôs so weird looking back on things and knowing I didn‚Äôt know anything about it. Just reached my 1 year anniversary on this game on dec. 29th! I love this game. The animation, the characters, the nation and culture representation, it‚Äôs really the game for me! The only problem is the storage. I would‚Äôve started much earlier if I had the storage on my phone. Tried to download the game SO many times, and now I play it on my new laptop! I became a venti main the moment I got him! I hate how people turn all of it about race and skin color, knowing that they wouldn‚Äôt give a crap if there were super dark colored characters in a nation representing pale people. They‚Äôre being racist themselves, and not even realizing it. The characters are beautiful and people don‚Äôt know how to just enjoy the game, and they make EVERYTHING about race. I love this game, keep it up! I might start on Honkai too soon, depending on how much daily grind there is. -A random Barbatos main",5
"Genshin impact is easily one of the BEST open world games I‚Äôve seen, and it is successful to be entertaining. I think the characters are great, and they have interesting backstories. However, I don‚Äôt like how anti free to play the game is. Yes it is simple to play as a free to play, but if you want a 5 star character it‚Äôs a completely different story. Primogems are annoying and tedious to get as a free to play, and when you get them you often only get a few. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 2021, and the raiden shogun banner just came out. I have 1673 primogems. I can afford 1 ten pull, and It took me 4 hours to get my primogems. I get nothing good, I grind for 7 ten pills which is enough for the 50/50! I get Diluc. The game is honestly just begging for money, and I hate it.

Another topic I really hate, characters. Specifically, the female ones. 
Every female character you see with interesting, sad, or traumatic backstory is depressed. They show almost no emotion other than being flirty or bored. But traveler fixes them, woohoo! 
I just think that honkai showed a characters emotions much better than genshin does, and I wish that could be changed.",4
"First off, it‚Äôs a really good game. I‚Äôve ALWAYS wanted to play this. I watched my cousins and YouTubers play this, it l looked so fun! So,I downloaded it. It took a while. I really like genshin,I only started on Saturday! Though, I don‚Äôt really like how long it took to download, also how much GB it took! They have really good characters design! But sadly it glitched A LOTT. So that‚Äôs why I rate Genshin impact a 4, if it wasn‚Äôt for how much storage it took and how laggy it is then I would‚Äôve gave it a 5. Sometime before cutscenes it takes a long time until it pops up, also sometimes it has really bad quality. I actually still have around 30 something GB left so it shouldn‚Äôt be too laggy. I also tried deleting some games and messages to save my storage. Other than all the lagginess it originally is a really good quality game! I recommend this to people who like adventures and people who like doing gachas! The gacha animation is amazing! I really like this game, since I just started I don‚Äôt have MUCH experience but I really like this game. Sometimes I get real mad when it starts to not load and lags. üò≠",4
I love this game so much! It‚Äôs basically all I play- but! Mihoyo.. please give our fellow genshin players a response to the anniversary rewards.. instead of hiding and censoring all the hate comments.. please? I don‚Äôt mean to sound mean.. I really like this game! I really do! And I don‚Äôt want it to go down it flames.. I have to agree with other people that the anniversary rewards were disappointing.. and not that special.. I mean I kinda mind but not really- although! Other people do mind.. a lot of people have been supporting you mihoyo.. please think about this.. it‚Äôs really important to all of us that you actually give us a response instead of censoring the hate.. yes some of us are REALLY overreacting but! They do have a point.. I do like the new event! Because of the primogems obviously- but! This is very special mihoyo.. it‚Äôs our anniversary together! And we all love and care about this game! So we all expect you to atleast give us a decent reward instead of coping what you did in the lantern festival.. thank you and please read this.. if you do read this than don‚Äôt come answering me about the problem I want you to give ALL our fellow genshin players a response.. NOW..,3
"I love this game! It has consumed me for weeks.  I‚Äôve been looking for a game that actually has a RPG gameplay with grinding and an open world for forever. Plus it‚Äôs not pay to play or one of those games where you have to rely on other players to proceed or beat bosses.  It does have a co-op mode which is easy to use during special events, but not mandatory to win. The story is nothing special but you can skip through dialogue if you‚Äôre bored and still complete everything without confusion. My only real issue is the advertising that this game has seven continents to explore when there are only two. Once you finish those you‚Äôre just left with no missions and wondering where to go next and what you need to find! Eventually I went online and asked where I go next and I found out that the game is still being developed that the other continents aren‚Äôt open and it‚Äôll be months and months before they do.  I think that should be made apparent or you just should talk about how you can explore all 7 continents.",5
"This game is very popular and I love it too. The story line, setting design, character design, etc. There are some things I have some issues with mainly with WiFi and downloading. WiFi for genshin needs to be strong so you don‚Äôt lag out, but lots of people don‚Äôt have really strong WiFi (coming from a mobile player) The downloading also takes pretty long at least an hour. Though, I‚Äôm okay with part of this because the game is really detailed it needs all of this. Improvements could be made and I do have suggestions. Such as the anniversary gift, not many people enjoyed it because the gift was to many people for f2p people. I do agree, not even 1 wish (at least that‚Äôs what people are saying) Another thing I‚Äôd like (my personal opinion for this one) is a create your own character. I would find this pretty cool, though it would take up a lot of GB too and probably lots of updates for it. These are all some of my opinions but I really enjoy this game and think it‚Äôs a great game for people to play!",5
"It‚Äôs an overall very good game. It has nice graphics, the characters are diverse, there are lots to do in the game. I am a casual f2p gamer. I love the open world and able to collect various things. On the other hand, you basically have to dedicate lots of time if you want to be good at this game or spend money. I don‚Äôt have time to even do commissions everyday, so I guess it‚Äôs my lost. But when I do have time to play, it‚Äôs a lot to catch up with and I have to skip multiple banners to even get close to getting a 5 star and even if I get it. My first 5 star took 120+ pulls. I know I‚Äôm unlucky but that‚Äôs ridiculous. A lot of the hidden mechanics of the game, such as the pity system, is sometimes hard to understand for players like myself. It‚Äôs sometimes overwhelming. Also, the UI is extremely confusing. It is difficult to navigate and everything is super cluster. It‚Äôs endless menu options. Can we also get a ‚Äúskip dialogue‚Äù and activity status options please?

This game is just right up my ally. It‚Äôs just hard to keep up with, like the in-game gameplay and external events. (Sorry it‚Äôs long ü§™üß¢)",4
"I‚Äôll be honest, this game spoils the player base. And I love it. The amount of care and details that go into everything- from the lore, actual books that you can read, the npcs different actions depending on the nation, each characters well throughout design (both in appearance, attacks, personalities/voice lines, and elemental skills).  
There‚Äôs a lot to do. Wanna go fishing? Wanna farm to better your characters/personal level? Wanna go on story quests to get to know the characters? Or hangout events, or world quests, or the main quest, or the events. You can cook, make a house, catch critters, fight monsters, delve into the complex stories and theories. Hunt for the most aesthetically pleasing character. 100% the map. Beat the spiral abyss. Explore the nations. And, most importantly, find your lost twin. 

I play nearly every day, and have been playing since the game came out. Each update welcomes new events or even open world locations. Not to mention that it‚Äôs still going! 
I got the game without any understanding of what it would be like, and I love it!",5
"When I first started to play this game it was the most fun I ever had in so long the graphics the song tracks the voice acting the characters design are done so well the events are great some are just not fun/ just a chore to do sometime but the event that was fun were hide n seek and the gliding challenge and the golden archipelago are my favorite and the maps are big and gorgeous scenery and fun time exploring the map but the game need more things to do late game like more replay able content because after way you don‚Äôt do to much beside commission and using all for your 160 resin or just add more resin and need to fix some bugs that lets you go through walls or just get stuck and need to have rework for amber like changing her kit so she can be more useful, qiqi Barbara and kokomi need to do something else beside just their for heals because their other/ better unit that do their jobs and give att buff or deal more dmg but this game is really fun to play  for the sound tracks characters design graphics voice acting  they did a really good job",5
"Honestly, I love this game so much. It consumes so much of my time and it got me through Covid. However, it takes up so much storage, and it‚Äôs hard to have access to all the fancy computers required to play the game. I have a Nintendo switch, but the promised port never came. I got C3 Diluc today and the gatcha rates are just embarrassing. I was pulling for albedo, a character I‚Äôve wanted since I started playing, and I got diluc again, the only standard character I‚Äôve ever gotten. I‚Äôm not complaining about losing the 50/50 because it happens, and that‚Äôs how the game makes money. However, the rates are horrible. Being F2P is a nightmare if you want to hit big numbers and it‚Äôs really hard to get through the game. Other than that, the graphics, soundtrack and character details are stunning, even if there is a bit of a pixelated lag every now and then. I would completely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun action RPG. love this game to death, but please please please don‚Äôt hesitate when helping out F2Ps with getting characters and weapons that can suit their team.",4
"Ok, you guys have definitely raised the bar with mobile games. I‚Äôve been playing rpg games, open world games, mmorpg‚Äôs, gacha collect games, and etc for years without being satisfied in the long term. However, this game right here has definitely raised the bar. From the moment I first downloaded it, to now, I‚Äôve been honestly impressed. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is beautiful, the characters are unique, the interactions are very well thought out, and the storyline is very intricate. I also love the way that you can incorporate elements and combinations to turn tides in battle, and the way that different characters have different things to offer in terms of combat. EVEN THE MENU SCREENS ARE BEAUTIFUL. I definitely see myself playing this for years into the future and I hope that you guys make more content as we go on and add events and things. You‚Äôve earned it. This is the most beautiful, immersive, enjoyable game on the mobile market for me. Oh, and I heard there will be controller support? Kinda excited to see that added to the game since I mainly play on controllers. üëåüèæüëçüèæ",5
"I love this game and it is currently is one of my favorites. I definitely recommend. A lot of people have talked about it‚Äôs pros so I‚Äôm not going to spend a lot of time on that and get straight to what I don‚Äôt like. Hopefully the developers may see this. 
One thing I dislike is that characters true potentials are locked behind constellations. The only way to unlock constellations is to win that character multiple times through a gacha system, which is incredibly hard to do unless you pay a crap ton of money. I think constellations should be more accessible, with other ways to unlock them. For example, with primogems, an in-game currency. Or, you should be able to trade characters you do not want for constellation material. 
Also, I‚Äôve never been a fan of gacha systems. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating not getting what you worked / paid for. I think the rates could be a bit better. 
Other than that, the game is awesome. Those problems are a bit annoying, but do not overall ruin the game and it‚Äôs still worth playing.",5
"I just want to say how much I admire the work that was put into creating this game for mobile. The level of detail and overall immersion involved in this game really can make you wanna play for hours just discovering the land! I mean yes the combat system is by far one of the best that I have encountered not only amongst RPG genre but for many other combat involved games as well, Genshin Impact takes the cake! My only suggestion as for something to make the experience even better, would be controller support. I‚Äôm sure you folks down in development have heard this a million times over, but please would you consider at least adding it for a short time and letting us, the players, decide if we like it or not. There are many of us who prefer mobile or can‚Äôt afford consoles so for you to make this one a mobile was a huge one up for the mobile community. It‚Äôs just that some of us still enjoy remote control playing. If you could please hear us out, it‚Äôs the only thing we are asking. Oh and of course PVP!! Because who doesn‚Äôt love PVP! And then maybe co-op campaign?",5
I know there‚Äôs more content coming out which is great but once you finish the story so far the games true character comes out. It‚Äôs nothing but a cash grab. Once you have beaten the story everything left to requires money to do. Console quality graphics and story. Mobile game mechanics and monetization.  This game is a gacha game meaning there‚Äôs a gambling element to it. For characters and weapons. Compares to other games in this category the rates for pulling characters and weapons are FAR lower than other games and the cost for pulling is twice as much as most other games. Character progression is gated behind an energy system on top of a grinding system. Most other games of this type are far more generous with their energy system.  It gets worse. You can spend hundreds trying to get a specific top tier character you want but only to realize that the character is in balanced to the point where he is out classed by mid tier characters. Once the entire players base is up in arms about this the developer responds basically with ‚Äúlol git gud‚Äù. So my advice for everyone is enjoy the game for what it is. Take your time to go through the story and don‚Äôt spend a single time. Use the free rolls you earn and don‚Äôt spend another time trying to pull anything else. It‚Äôs just not worth it.,1
"Hoyoverse if you don‚Äôt made the dendro archon at least tan I will give you 1 star on every device I have and refund all the money I‚Äôve spent delete all my accounts give 1 star ratings on every game you‚Äôve created even Honkai I‚Äôm mean it‚Äôs not that hard there are only 2 characters that have darker skin and they are only 4 stars and they hardly are noticed in the game as many characters you‚Äôve made they‚Äôve all been pale as heck it‚Äôs  not that hard, you have the ability to make Hispanic, black, and characters that have valtigo(sorry if I spelt that wrong) and you decide to make the most palest characters not to mention the sexualization of the woman in the game i don‚Äôt care if they are adults it‚Äôs still hella weird at least hire a woman to work with you it‚Äôs like you‚Äôve never even seen a woman before, but the rest is fine also give characters like Razor, Xinyan, Bennett, more attention like more backstory please I want to know more about Razors real family please and more about Xinyan, but overall the gameplay is amazing and the graphics are good to the English voice acting is kinda off for some characters and the storyline for the game is good too.",3
"Genshin Impact is by far my favorite game. I‚Äôm not much of a gamer but it makes it all the more impressive how obsessed I am with this game. The world is so immersive I feel like I‚Äôm exploring all the magical places with my own two feet and meeting all the wonderful characters myself. I would give this game five stars but my one critique is a pretty big one. It lacks dark skin representation. I mean all the characters are almost paper white. This made some sense when all the regions where based on countries where being lighter skin was more standard. But now with Sumeru which is supposedly based on Egypt, Persia, and India it‚Äôs makes zero sense. It‚Äôs just straight up colorism. At this point we only have two tan characters and literally no NPC‚Äôs. I would be so much more excited for Sumeru if they weren‚Äôt they weren‚Äôt messing up so bad. I‚Äôm also surprised at how most of the player base doesn‚Äôt seem to care enough and is even defending Mihoyo. With such an internationally renowned game and so much other types of representation I really would have expected more. I love this game but honestly, do better.",4
"I adore this game. The artstyle, combat, story. It‚Äôs all really amazing, and if you‚Äôre looking for a fun I open world game to play I can‚Äôt recommend this enough. It‚Äôs free on all platforms and has cross save, so it‚Äôs great on the go or at home. One issue though, resin. Resin is an awful system. You get limited amounts a day then you have to wait hours for it to restore. Resin is used for almost everything you grind, money key limes, exp key limes, domains, events. For all the things you can do with it you don‚Äôt have near enough of it. After you do the main story the game relies on you to grind your characters up, and get new ones to incentivize playing but you can‚Äôt for more than an hour because the resin system prevents long term gains. You should add a system where you can stack resin if you‚Äôre not using it, or increase the cap. Anything to make resin a resource that drains less quick. I want to spend hours grinding on your game but the resin system prevents that. Though that being said, there is a lot of things that don‚Äôt use resin such as side quests, main quests, and exploring so it‚Äôs still a great game despite this system.",4
"I love this game and the story and the characters. The startling lack of representation outside of pale Asians and white Europeans, however, is a HUGE issue with this game. The next major update of this game is planning to mash several Middle Eastern and North African cultures into one, which is horrible and wrong. Plus, there is no acknowledgement of any African or Latine or Hispanic or Caribbean or Indigenous countries or cultures in this game at ALL. Nearly every single character in this game is pale, it‚Äôs like Hoyoverse is afraid of people who aren‚Äôt. Many video game developers have finally began to represent and acknowledge the diverse cultures and races that live around the world, why doesn‚Äôt Genshin reflect that? People of every race and shade love this game and it‚Äôs disheartening that those of us who are Black, Latine, Native, and outside of East Asia are never represented. For the Sumeru update, or for further notice, please bring on a team of developers and writers from around the world and fairly represent the different countries and people of the world individually as our cultures beautifully are. If you can do that for Japan, China, Germany, and France; please consider doing that for other countries as well, people are hurting at your decision and we want to see you do better. Thank you.",1
"I‚Äôve seen plenty of ads for Genshin Impact and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was like some other mobile games where the ad and the game are completely different. Safe to say, GI is exactly like it‚Äôs ads.
The world is beautifully crafted and fun to explore. The combat is engaging and is based off not just mashing the melee button but figuring out which characters element will give you an advantage against whichever enemies. 
This is a great game to have on your phone if you‚Äôre on the go but it‚Äôs also just a great game in general and has become my go to when chilling on the couch.
Keep an eye on your battery though, I played so much already that within a few hours I received the battery low message while in the middle of a fight. 
It‚Äôs a beautiful game with an interesting world and fun as h**l combat. If you have the space, download it and give it a try. There are in app purchases but nothing is mandatory for playing the game. I‚Äôve already sunk a few hours in and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll sink many more into the lovely world.",5
"While the game has outstanding overall production (which is be the one thing that will reel you in to play the game) it‚Äôs not until you invest a ton of time into the game do you realize it‚Äôs mediocracy. For an open world game, it is a very bland experience. While the sights are nice to look at, the exploration is terrible because of how little the game rewards you for exploring. You‚Äôre basically running around looking for chests that included nothing more than exp fodder. The progression is also terrible, probably one of the worst I‚Äôve seen because of how many materials it takes to completely build a character while the game hardly gives you the necessary resin to do so. The rng aspect of the artifact drops is also horrendous. While the game is open world, it gets old rather quickly because of how you manually have to run around the map and collect food ingredients, ore, enemy mats and such. It is a very monotonous and tedious task to do this on a daily basis. Gameplay is rather average; it has the same fundamentals as it‚Äôs predecessor Honkai Impact 3rd. Having listed all my gripes of the game, I believe my rating of the game is justified. In my opinion the only praise-worthy aspect of the game is it‚Äôs production.",3
"Hihi! I‚Äôm a player from the NA server and i‚Äùm really enjoying this game so far! i‚Äôm at 35 and i‚Äôm having a blast! there‚Äôs just one problem. if you‚Äôve played genshin, or atleast heard of it, you‚Äôd know of their wishing system. it allows you to get new characters and weapons. but of course, it‚Äôs not free. since i don‚Äôt want this review to be too long, and over explained, just google up ‚Äúgenshin pull/wish system‚Äù if you don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôm talking about. moving on i‚Äôll get straight to the point. i‚Äôm an f2p player, (free to play) and i‚Äôm just so infatuated with the amazing characters mihoyo comes out with. but the thing is, none of them are free and most of them are hard to get as they are 5 stars. it‚Äôs costs about 160 primo gems to get one wish, and most of the time you can only get a 3 star weapon. the pity system is extremely unfair. almost 90 wishes just for one five star? even the ‚Äúgenerous gifts‚Äù you guys give us aren‚Äôt enough for one wish. do better mihoyo. consider the fact that most of your players are broke minors, who have no intention of spending money in the game.",4
"I‚Äôm quite surprised with the production quality of this game. For the internet to brush it off as a BotW knock of does it a disservice to the overall experience. Sure there are mechanics like climbing and use of a glider, gathering materials spread through out the over world, and the general environmental design and look similarities. But due to the combat and now the narrative is progressed, it‚Äôs a far different experience. It‚Äôs has taken good aspects of BotW and established it‚Äôs own game, I consider this to be a homage with extreme similarities than just a knock off trying to piggy back on BotW popularity and polish. I myself brushed it off as a BotW copy cat, but I was very surprised to be wrong about that. Now I hope the gacha mechanic doesn‚Äôt sour the overall experience and make it worth while for free to play players. Though like Arknights, I hope this game becomes something the player wants to put in their own hard earned money due to how well made this game might be. But this only has bouts been released, and the studio probably are planning to hold events like other gacha games, adding to the game.",5
"Storage is a huge problem for this app. I believe that in the 2.8 patch, its an option to delete the saved dialogue from quests (which shouldve been implemented right away). But the problem with this, if it was even added at all? You have to download the full game, including that saved dialogue first. Which doesnt make sense- in Honkai, your able to download the basic resources and then download voice&story if you wish later on. Genshin shouldve done this- it wouldve caused a LOT less trouble. Instead, your forced to download the full 15/16 gigs and THEN, if the feature is even available this update, possibly delete it. Genshin itself is a good rpg/exploration with a pretty good storyline. The storage space and lack of representation is the real problem. Would like to play a rerun of my favorite event before im unable to download it at all, but considering that ive spent literal hours trying to make space and download the game, i dont think im gonna be able to. Disappointing.

Edit: I‚Äôve discovered that i CANT actually download basic resources. Considering they‚Äôve done this with Honkai, id honestly expect that they would have added it WAY earlier in genshin. Spent 2 hours clearing up space just to delete again, wish it didnt take up about 15 of the 32 gb i have.",1
"I have been playing the game since April, and ever since then I‚Äôve been playing everyday wishing and trying to get characters and making friends, and I love this game so much! but, there are a few things I think they should fix / add : for mobile, you can still play the game, but I find it hard because the quality + lag while playing the game. the game either kicks you out or it stops whatever you‚Äôre doing in it. I know it may come soon, but dendro characters. yes, we‚Äôve met people with dendro visions in the game, but ever since the game was released, there hasn‚Äôt been any new playable dendro characters. they should also add cryo catalysts, or any weapon that hasn‚Äôt been used with a certain element yet. overall, the game is super fun and MiHoyo has spent a long time making and designing characters, and my favorite designed character has to be Raiden Shogun and/or Hu Tao. I love the kids in the game and my favorite archon is Venti! the game is well made and is very creative, it‚Äôs worth downloading.",5
"I love the game and I love the sense of adventure it gives me, the open world experience is just amazing, but I‚Äôll in the future that I can also cook what ever I want to mix to make my own dishes (maybe it don‚Äôt ever happen, but it will be very awesome if it does! Cause ik many as well will love that!) I also will love to pet the animals, I can‚Äôt complain at least we can have them in our home jajaja ü•∞, so far I love everything and Liyue is my favorite part of the game due to it‚Äôs traditional appearance and connection with nature!

"Hello, I‚Äôm a competitive gamer and I‚Äôve been gaming since 20 years ago since I was a little toddler, I am now 30 years old. I‚Äôve played games such as starcraft, league of legends, counter strike, fighting games etc but genshin impact is totally something new and fun to play and of course they did it the right way with waifus and cool looking designs. Even tho it‚Äôs PvE game it‚Äôs still really fun. Dailies take 5-10 mins then grinding what you need is another 15-30 mins a day which doesn‚Äôt take a lot of your time at all, then you can log off and do whatever you need to do off the game. I am a dolphin that spends thousands of dollars on gacha and pay to win games so for me to have free time after doing what I need on this game is awesome. Events and content just keeps coming and they roll it out so well. There‚Äôs never any long maintenance time and extended maintenance which is amazing compared to many other games out there. They listen to their players and try to fix things such as zhongli, etc etc. I see this game going on for a long time! Great job mihoyo",5
"I really really love Genshin Impact, the graphics are unlike any I‚Äôve seen in a mobile game, it‚Äôs really impressive. it‚Äôs super fun to fight enemies and switch around your characters to create different elemental reactions and the different fight styles & gameplays of the characters add a new fresh experience every time. Co-op is very fun to do as well, and ik there‚Äôs going to be future updates that‚Äôll add new functions to the friends list like being able to chat with your friends and set notes for them. the only thing that I‚Äôd like changed is the artifacts and if maybe there were just an easier way to assign them to characters without individually having to look at each of the stats and what set bonuses they provide, but that‚Äôs just my own insight since I take a lot of time and consideration into choosing artifacts for my characters so it‚Äôs rather tedious and I have to focus hard everytime I set apart time to do so üòÖ final rating: the graphics are truly beautiful, love the characters and gameplay, the story is interesting and the cutscenes are honestly amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I‚Äôve just got to say, this is an amazing game! The graphics are TOP TIER, the storyline is great! I love open world games. This game overall is great! What I don‚Äôt like is the gatcha system. It‚Äôs almost impossible to get any five star characters without paying a lot of money. I think that‚Äôs one BIG flaw to this game. The next thing I have an issue with is leveling and gaining experience. It‚Äôs getting more challenging as you progress through the game. Some people will just be stuck on AR 54-56 for months. To gain any kind of EXP you need resin, and domains cost 20 while bosses cost 40 and you have to make do with only the 160 you get which is really kind of crappy. It‚Äôs repetitive and that‚Äôs one of the reaosns why people are losing interest. I used to spend hours on Genshin grinding away and leveling through, but now I only spend about 30 minutes because there‚Äôs just nothing to do. Sometimes I just don‚Äôt even bother to log in anymore. I feel that with the way things are going, people will lose interest and stop playing Genshin all together, and that‚Äôs just sad. I really love this game but, I wish I could enjoy it more.",3
"Genshin is an AMAZING game, and it‚Äôs pretty much the only thing I play these days. The graphics and animations are amazing, and the voice acting is top notch. I love how the quests always have some sort of storyline behind it, and I always feel more urged to play, just to find out the ending! The whole wishing concept is also amazing, I remember being so excited to get my first five star, Kokomi, through it. Of course, I won‚Äôt forget about the adorable Paimon. Honestly, she just makes the game ten times better by adding comedy and just helping out. The new update is also so cool! I may or may not have a crush on Gorou. The game definitely deserves to be 5 stars. The only thing I would say is the fact that the amount of data it uses on my device makes it very long to load, especially if I don‚Äôt log on for a while. I would suggest making the loading screen with the elements take less time because I always need to swipe up and try again. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great game and keep up the good work!!!",5
"This is literally my favorite game. BUT THERE ARE IDIOTS THAT ARE NOT THANKFUL. Mihoyo is giving us our rewards. I know. It is a craze. But stop being unthankful for ur prizes because it is just the first anniversary of Mihoyo. We do not deserve this and we can‚Äôt just treat Mihoyo like they are some people that give you five stars so easily. Just let them start with something small! Like y‚Äôall going crazy for characters and stupid expectations. Someone once told me that you have to have your own limits. Don‚Äôt let your expectations get a ahead of you. Some of you are not thankful for the things you have. Think about the starters! They also get rewards too! They are happy since they get to have characters you may have! They don‚Äôt get a five star that easily! Mihoyo works so hard so stop acting like a baby and start accept what you have an what you do not because others do not get your luxury. So simple, eh? THEN JUST LISTEN. Be thankful, gosh, you guys are so harsh on Mihoyo. (Guys keep in mind it is only some people in the fandom.)",5
"Amazing game. I‚Äôve been playing for like 5 months or so now! Fav game ever. Except the new inazuma update‚Ä¶Being AR 30, well I‚Äôm not THAT left out. But being low in my archon quests‚Ä¶:(
Basically, I‚Äôm upset because all my friends are on inazuma, and I‚Äôm left out in all the events, and can‚Äôt even ascend Baal, because I can‚Äôt farm for her materials. 

If you are looking at reviews before download‚Ä¶
Genshin is amazing! Beautiful graphics, stunning characters, and more. If you would like to be a ftp, this game supports you! Sometimes it‚Äôs a little hard, with all the temptation, but it‚Äôs much easier then other P2W games. And, the wishing system is super fun! I love getting 50/50 pity on limited banners. Artifacts are kind of hard to get actually good ones. But, the amazing thinks are also about co-op, and so much more. I really really enjoy genshin. But a clear message, I have not played till AR 60. Nor unlocked inazuma. I‚Äôm still lazing around in Liyue. But genshin is a great game. I really recommend! (Ignore the 1 star reviews. It‚Äôs 5 year olds confused of the controls‚Ä¶)",5
"Fun and full of adventure. Genshin Impact is a RPG game. It has an anime style with beautiful scenes. You fight monsters and there's lots of characters you could get. Some are stronger than the others. They are marked by star ranking and colors. Purple is really good, blue is ok. Its Free and fun to play. My personal feelings for it is that I love the action but there's a lot of talking. Sometimes I just skip throws and hope for the best. The more you play the more you level up. The more you level up the more stuff you unlock and gain to upgrade your character and the weapons for your character. This Game reminds me of an anime I watched a long time ago. Sword Art Online. It's almost the same. Except in Genshin it's not Vr and there's not that many monster variations and you are not able to create your own character. What I like about Genshin is that it's a free map. You have missions to accomplish but it doesn't force you to complete them automatically. You can be given a mission and then do whatever you want. You can either explore the world and hunt and cook or you can carry on with the mission.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for quite some time now and there are only a few features that bug me otherwise this games is amazing! The open-world experience, the quests, every aspect of it I love. However when I fight bosses for things that‚Äôll help my characters grow, for example artifacts. Artifacts are a really useful way to up your characters stats so they become stronger or whatever aspect you‚Äôre focusing on upgrading. Sometimes you don‚Äôt get those artifacts and instead your left with a whole lot of resin wasted, and resin takes a while to replenish, 8 minutes for 1. So in theory 16 hours for all 160 to replenish. Anyways where I‚Äôm going with this is trading, I think a trading aspect would be super great for the players! Maybe someone has an artifact you don‚Äôt and they have a weapon you don‚Äôt, trade request bam! And then they trade. This would make obtaining artifact sets a whole lot less of a hassle and would be an amazing feature to add! Thank you for reading! -sincerely, GaryTheCanary",5
"After I achieved AR 56, I can proudly say that this is a game well worth my time. Although these days I play mostly periodically (especially when a major update comes out), this game is truly something magical. I am engrossed with the main lore and sub-plot involving the characters. Speaking about the characters‚Ä¶ They are so well crafted, with not only aesthetically-pleasing design, but also intriguing personalities. And of course, what has drawn me in this game was initially the open-world dynamics. It is such a breath of fresh air to come back to this game and feel a sense of wonder that I‚Äôve felt in lower AR levels. However, one criticism that I have with this game is the overall gameplay. Although this gameplay can be switched up with events, overall, completing commissions to get primogems becomes rather boring. There is little to no variety in slaying monsters and the like. So I would suggest incorporating more ways to gain primogems, so that everyone‚Äôs experience is more dynamic with less monotony. But otherwise, solid game! Amazing.",5
"I love this game, I really do. But the fact that there are no black people in the game is why I‚Äôm giving this a one star. Sumeru is based of South Asia, yet you couldn‚Äôt give us ONE black character? I‚Äôm super disappointed in hoyoverse. No, Cyno and Dehya are not black because they aren‚Äôt pale white like everyone else. The dendro archon IS LITERALLY THE COLOR WHITE. I hope, as a black person myself, that you don‚Äôt expect us the wait around and take every bribe you give us because you can‚Äôt add one dark skin character. Candace was based of an amazing black princess and you white washed her. She is not black. I‚Äôve seen white people darker than her. This a disappointment to me and the genshin community. The fact that you pulled this with sumeru out of all places, and you gave us a lightbulb for an archon, is sad. You never listen to your player base whenever we ask for something. Just because you‚Äôre a multi million dollar company doesn‚Äôt mean anything when it comes to your player base. If you guys try this with Natlan, me and many others will not hesitate to leave this game. This is a disappointment to every poc person waiting for representation, only to see this. Please get your act together, or this won‚Äôt be the only one star review you‚Äôre getting.",1
"This is a super good game for being on a mobile device! I love everything about it except three things! I wish that there was a way to fully customise whichever sibling you choose to play as (hair, face, body, etc.), another way besides teleporting and gliding across the world (or running) I‚Äôve seen some mobile games add creatures such as horses or mythical animals that you can collect and I would personally love love love to have a horse and just run through this world! It‚Äôs already so beautiful and amazing I don‚Äôt want to teleport and the running is just a little too slow for my personal taste (It‚Äôs perfect when you‚Äôre in the city parts though!) and gliding to me is just meh. My last thing is pets! I would love to have some pets that could maybe help you out when you fight but in return you have to feed them food that you make or raw meat. If I only had to pick one of these three options I would totally go with the ridable creatures! Overall though I do really like this game. I normally get tired of a game after playing it for a few minutes but this one surprised me. I can‚Äôt wait to see what else you guys add to it!",4
"The game was great at first but with time it started rotting. With all the nations we have Liyue is the only one that gets the best lore or attention from the company, while all the other nations are ignored or left with mid lore, Something a high schooler can write for their creative writing if they try hard enough. Not to mention lack of representation, they‚Äôre currently making a new region which is Sumeru, a country inspired after Indian/Middle Eastren culture. You‚Äôd expect the major skin tone of characters would be dark, no? However most of the ones leaked today are extremely light. White washing is a very common theme in Asia especially countries around here, so what they‚Äôre doing is not helping. Not to mention them mixing Indian and middle Eastern culture alone is so wrong on many levels. All the other regions were inspired after only one country alone but sumeru is mixed and messy bc of lack of research and respect. Honestly expected more from this game, it was so good at first but now it‚Äôs terrible. Don‚Äôt download it, not worth it at all it‚Äôs time consuming and has bad rng for both farming certain material in game and pulling for characters you want, don‚Äôt download especially if you have gambling addiction or struggle with those kind of things.",1
"Okay, first of, let me say Genshin Impact is an amazing game and you should try it out! (if you have enough storage space). You almost always have something to do in the low ar‚Äôs.

However, Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt seem to pay attention to feedback, so it‚Äôs always the same cycle of farming for a character for weeks, if not a month or two, then getting the character and the cycle restarts. And that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre lucky enough to get the character, which isn‚Äôt all that high of a chance, seeing as you have to pull 40 times to get to 90% pity. Unless you use money or you‚Äôve been farming for 6 months, you won‚Äôt have nearly enough primogems for that. And if you lose the 50/50 it‚Äôs pretty much over. 

Genshin Impact is a wonderful game to play, especially if you like fighting and leveling up characters without the gore and stuff. But soon you‚Äôll find that if you want to get good at the game, you‚Äôll need to spend money on the game, which isn‚Äôt great since many items are a bit overpriced. This os only my opinion of the game, you should definitely try the game out of you want your own experience to go off of.",3
"I love this game. The characters, story, and gameplay are all fun and engaging. I was enjoying nearly every moment I had with this game up until now. When the 1 Year Anniversary hit, I was hopeful for some kind of fun celebration between the players and Mihoyo, that included rewards and events. Instead, I was met with disrespect and a slap to the face, followed by childlike ignorance of a major problem. The rewards were almost nothing, and the events required either essentially free advertising, or hours of work by artist for only a chance to receive anything in return. There was hardly even a celebration at all, and it truly felt as though Mihoyo spat in the face of those who have supported their game since the beginning. The way the company is treating this issue is outrageous, and I am thoroughly disappointed. Deleting negative reviews, banning accounts that speak up, shutting down the Reddit page, it is all truly disgusting behavior. In due time, I'm sure this review will be taken down as well, but I want to get my word out there, as I am a player of this game and deserve a voice. I hope that someday, Mihoyo will make up for their mistake and apologize, as the scar left within the community is a deep one that will take a long time to heal.",1
"I‚Äôve played since Kaedehara Kazuha‚Äôs release and it‚Äôs been a very fun game! Very nice art design and gameplay. I love how the elemental reaction makes it easier for players to crit or just for the damage to be way better. The banners last a while which makes it easier for you to save up for another or the same wishing banner. The wishing system is a little complicated but once you play for 1 month or longer, you‚Äôll understand that you need to get a standard 5 star character to be guaranteed. Theres no character better than another, which means you can build any character and get good damage. People say the starter character, Amber, is horrible but she is really good with Constellation#2. The co-op system is really fun but I wish they the partner could stay while we unlock a statue. I also want it to be possible to talk to npcs during co-op. Another thing I want the Hoyoverse to do is make the possibility of the 3 starter characters; Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa, to be higher in the wishing system. Besides that, TCG is great and the game is too.",4
"Genshin Impact is,just such a good investment for you‚Äôre time. There is just so much content,so many updates and events to look forward too all the time! There is just one issue that I have with the game is how much storage and space it takes,and how much lag I experience while playing sometimes,however that‚Äôs the only complaint. There is always something you can do in the game. You can really never be bored. I think the lag and whatnot might just be on my end,considering the devices I use to play genshin are a bit outdated and I‚Äôm getting a new laptop and iPad Air, so hopefully that will help with the lag. If found myself spending hours on this game when expecting to really only play it for like 30 minutes a day. Honestly,not a game to install if you are often short on time üòÖ. But this really is an amazing game,and the amount of content and quality that this game contains,is worth the storage space and lag. Thank you for reading <3. Have a great day/night :)",5
"A couple of years ago I stumbled on a tumblr page with venti‚Äôs picture in it, at the time the comic was small and barely started and when I read it I loved venti instantly, the sad thing was how ever was that the blog post got deleted and couldn‚Äôt remember venti‚Äôs name and so I couldn‚Äôt find anything about that comic. 

A few years now and I was bewildered when my brother showed me the game and I was over the moon to see the adorable sprite once again, and by now who ever reads this review must realize that this game is my most favorite in the whole world, everything about it is just so beautiful and best part ? I got venti üíöüçÄ‚òÅÔ∏è the whole project it self is very inspiring especially that I feel that the game had set the bar very high for the market to actually produce very good quality games and not something random and mindless. 

In the end I would like to say: that I you for the mihoyo team for making this story, I will be an avid fan and wait tell we reach the end of our traveling journey üí´‚≠êÔ∏è.",5
"This is the first multi-platform game to ever really capture my attention and keep it.
I‚Äôve been grinding out working on my characters and team, and I love to see their growth. Not to mention the story is very cool and keeps us busy as players.
However. In recent game play we‚Äôve seen the boss ‚ÄúChilde‚Äù get his difficulty lowered to make it more accessible for all players. Which is awesome. But there‚Äôs a boss in particular, the Oceanid is ridiculously overpowered. Even with a team of 3 level 60 characters, a level 50 healer, and a level 3 world my team was absolutely obliterated in under 2 minutes. I can‚Äôt even fight this thing anymore to level up my healer because of how strong it is. I know how you stack your team plays a big part in this game but you should still be able to at least be able to fight and make progress. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
I ask the game developers to consider taking a second look at the stats and difficulty of the Oceanid and consider lowering it‚Äôs difficulty like Childe‚Äôs",5
"I've played Genshin a lot, the most obvious issue is that this is possibly one of the most Grindy types of Mobile gacha games I have ever experienced, I haven't had terrible luck at all but it honestly is far too much to even get a singular summon, let alone 10 just to have a minimum chance at getting a character you like. This game almost forces you into that pay to win mindset just to be successful or get what you want. Free to play should be a lot more relaxed, so as an overall it should give out more of it's own in game currency. This brings me to the other issue, the game doesn't really have any good events or rewards, especially with the recent anniversary, it is almost empty feeling and the grind for leveling up characters is even harder, many resources often not even being able to be accessible easily, leaving you many times, more often than not, heavily under leveled. As of now I am unwavering in this review and until I see change I won't change or remove this review and if you see this review disappear, most likely the developers have removed it to silence us.",3
"So when I downloaded this game from the PlayStation Store it didn't seem very interesting I was also kinda mad that it took so long to load but once I saw the opening cutscene and tutorial I took everything back the animation is perfect the movements are fluid and the and the character designer is obviously very skilled also (character spoiler alert) Paimon explains the basics in a way that is easy to understand the vast amount of content in this game is astonishing I just wish you could crouch this game reminded me of Botw and it all flooded back to me how a lot of people hate this game because it's a lot like Botw for example Botw only has 3Ô∏è‚É£ elements while GI has 7‚É£ and an elemental combat system in conclusion this game is amazing,  perfect and chalk full of content to keep you busy I would also like to thank the voices for the characters(character spoiler alert 2) Zach Aguilar (Male twin), Corina Boettger(Paimon), Kelly Baskin(Amber), Laura Faye Smith(Noelle),  Josey Montana McCoy(Kaeya), Mara Junot(Lisa) and Sarah Miller Crews(Female twin) I wish I could list more but those are the only characters I have. Also Ima say this now IT'S FREE",5
"A chinese company making a free to play game that captures all the best aspects of JRPG‚Äôs & breath of the wild! This is one of few times the gatcha system didnt dissuade me from playing. The game has a great original soundtrack, combat system, & (something Botw lacked) voicelines for practically everything (& in multiple languages)! To top it all off, the game is cross-compatible w/ ps4, pc, mobile; cross-save for mobile & pc, & a tba switch date! All of this free so i dont understand how anyone could give this game anything but five stars. The story & dialogue are better than most retail games lately & the cutscenes are as beautiful as the world that‚Äôs created. There‚Äôs gonna release more content for free. I could go on about how astounded i am by this game & i recommend to anyone who enjoys PvE & multiplayer. I have an iphone xr & it runs super smooth & my phone doesnt get as hot as i thought it would. 

my only negative critique is the lack of keybinding/being able to edit the location or functionality of the mobile controls.",5
"I almost never write app reviews, but I just really feel the need to say how much I love this game.  I‚Äôve never played any game for this long (8 months now, I think), but Genshin Impact has kept me so engaged because of the story and characters, as well as the astounding amount of constant new content even when the next piece of the story is far off form being released.  The characters are easily my favourite part of the game, they‚Äôre all so beautifully designed just like the scenery and they‚Äôre all so easy to get attached to, especially since the voicelines almost let you interact and build relationships with each one.  Aside from that, the gameplay is really fun and the whole thing is so beautiful, and the gacha system is one of the easier ones I‚Äôve encountered to be honest because there‚Äôs so many ways to get the currency for it.  Absolutely incredible game, planning to stick around until the whole thing‚Äôs been released and I know I won‚Äôt regret doing so for a second!!",5
"Ever since I first started this game, I was hooked. From the cut scenes, fighting animations, to the character designs, and astonishing open-world scenery. This game is breathtaking and always has me entertained. I have been playing for a year now, and I can say I am an expert to the ins and outs of this game. I am always there for any updates, and livestreams they hold on twitch. And to make this game more addicting, there is a gacha system encouraging me to pull and spend all my primogems (in game currency ) just to have a chance to get a special character with abilities like no other. I can‚Äôt wait for new updates and more content to play. Since this game has a story line, it will come to an end eventually. Meaning there wont be more in terms of story. However I will keep supporting this game until the very end. Please play it, even if RPG isn‚Äôt the type of genre of game you like, it‚Äôs still a great game to try plus it‚Äôs free so you don‚Äôt need to spend any money unless you ultimately feel like you want to.",5
I‚Äôm an pc player on this game i played this game one month ago before it even started. I got really excited playing it and try to finished every achievements every wings and look around for chest. Now it been a year for me to play it. I was excited about this anniversary. It really disappointing how they dont really give us anything maybe a little bit of rewards like if you guys remember or watch liyue lantern rewards it so so much better than this reward we have right now. I cant be mad im just very disappointed. I still give it 3 stars the reason why when i first ever played it i have fun i wad challenging myself till new worlds comes. (Till i gotten burned out from continue playing so i took a break) besides this game not supposed to play more than 8 hrs a day it supposed to be maybe 4 hrs or less. You dont have to agree this review or not. I just feel do cheated on with the rewards and the money i spent on here it not fair. I still add 2 more stars just for me having fun in the beginning and have fun adventuring around. All i can say im not gonna spent anymore money in this game no more. Im just gonna play and have fun,3
"I can‚Äôt put into words my dissatisfaction with this company‚Äôs handling of the first anniversary. After the players giving them a year of major success and blowing the game up beyond anything that they were prepared for, we get essentially nothing. Don‚Äôt tell me to ‚Äúbe grateful for getting anything‚Äù for the celebration that is meant to thank the PLAYERS for keeping their game alive and relevant. Instead we are supposed to do promo for them and do favors for them when they continuously slap the players in the face with horribly tested and horribly designed characters, predatory marketing tactics, and features that make the new player experience absolutely horrendous. Many don‚Äôt realize that new players during this anniversary can‚Äôt even access most of the new content and can‚Äôt level or build any of the new characters until they reach an account level that takes the duration of the entire update to reach for someone putting an average amount of time into the game on a daily basis. Just complaining on reddit, Twitter, and discord isn‚Äôt going to do anything. Something needs to give, and I think leaving a review with an honest rating and telling both them and the people who will read reviews before playing what needs to change.",1
"I‚Äôm just a regular nine-year-old who wants to play a fighting game, but I can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs 12+, I watch my sister who is 13 play all the time and it‚Äôs starting to get on my nerves that I can‚Äôt played as well, this weird thing started on my phone where it doesn‚Äôt even let me get the app if it‚Äôs 12+ or higher and the apps that I had on my phone they were 12+ are gone, and now they‚Äôre back but I still can‚Äôt play them because of age restrictions and I just think that‚Äôs stupid the only reason why I can write this review is because I have the app, but it won‚Äôt let me use it, I have so many other apps like this and I don‚Äôt understand why those aren‚Äôt 12+ if this is literally the same thing, this app was the only app that would actually download all the way through, i‚Äôm very angry and I suggest that you change it to 9+ because it‚Äôs just not fair for regular nine-year-olds or a little kids who want to play a fun ,it‚Äôs a fighting game and yes I know there is dragons and killing but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to scar me for life. Please change it to 9+",5
"I've been playing this game since April 2022 and I , am in love with all the characters and regions. Mondstadt is charming, Liyue is exciting, Inazuma is stunning, and Sumeru is so full of life that even Sumeru City is lined with plants and NPCs! This game has wonderful designs, great humor, exciting adventures, adorable creatures, intricate storytelling, etc. I highly recommend for everyone of all sorts for all sorts of reason. Min-maxers for the character builds and spiral abyss, shippers for the many exciting relationships between characters, artists for the beautiful landscapes and intricate character designs, very angry people for all the things to be mad at in this game (abyss mages, spiral abyss floor 12, fatui, the chasm archon quests, artifact rolls, banner rolls, etc.), and even people with good luck can benefit from their good luck because of how. many. things. in. this. game. rely. on. luck. (i.e. artifact sets, artifact substats, artifact stats, artifact substat upgrades, solvent rolls, banner rolls, 50/50s, crit%, talent books, mob drops, and MORE). Basically this game has it all and I love it so much.",5
"Genshin Impact is one of those games where you could only play that game and not get bored. Graphics are beautiful and voice acting is also great. Its not so easy you get bored but not so hard that you really get mad and quit playing the game. I love the musicŸ´ and I don't really know much flaws this game has other than that its kinda laggy but this game takes up a lot of storage on my iPad which is probably why. But other than that this game is perfect and I suggest you play it if you haven't and I like how you can talk to basically any NPC I know its a pretty basic detail but I really like it. It can take a while to load but that dosent ruin the game for me I just put it there in case you don't like waiting. But other than that great game and I highly recommend it. I don't know very many anime-style games but I don't think there is many so I'll call this game sorta unique.

Okay download the game I guess otherwise you're missing out",5
"I love this game with a passion and have been playing for almost 1-2 years now. I find the game graphics beautiful and the character designs are wonderful, yet at the same time the characters are the issue about the game. Of course we have some issues based in storage as it takes a lot, also the pity system isn‚Äôt very f2p friendly. The biggest issue about the game nonetheless is the lack of representation. Throughout the lore we can see the nations are based off real places and cultures, yet they tend to stereotype it in places and refuse to make any characters that aren‚Äôt white except for two extremely lightskinned people. The community has been asking for so long for representation to be made for the poc community, and when we finally think hoyoverse will give the people the representation it needs for South Asians and Middle Eastern cultures the company shuts us out. All white and pale characters and still 0 representation the community is dying for. It‚Äôs obvious the game is racist and/or doesn‚Äôt care about the community. I find that a MAJOR flaw in any game, if hoyoverse were to fix this, I‚Äôd be willing to give higher ratings, but for now I absolutely will not until they listen to their community and other cultures.",1
"The game was super fun when it first came out because it had so much to do. The game is a still very high quality and solid combat. The issue is the publisher. After 1 year of playing everyday I can‚Äôt really recommend this game anymore. The hype is over. After 1 year of loyalty and $600 I put into this game‚Ä¶ it is pathetic how little the publisher does to fix the game. There are bugs still out there for 10month old characters‚Ä¶ system design issues and more. The publisher is getting lazy and doesn‚Äôt fix problems anymore. I believe they have the mentality now that instead of improving the game and addressing issues and feedback for the players they can just do whatever and a player is just a number that they don‚Äôt need because the game is still popular. Also fixing older characters doesn‚Äôt generate money so why bother. I will also mention that compared to every other gacha that I‚Äôve played, genshin is the stingiest. The login bonus is a joke and their anniversary event is so sad. For example, guardian tales is another gacha that I played this year and they gave out over 200 free summons‚Ä¶ Genshin is giving out 10 summons for the anniversary‚Ä¶

Now look at what they did to yae post release     ‚Ä¶",1
"Really cool game. Would recommend everyone to at least try if not get it. It really is fun and awesome. Graphics are great, and there is so much things to do. I do wish the ‚Äúwish‚Äù feature to get new characters was better. The main reason though I didn‚Äôt give this 5 stars was because the game keeps crashing. I have this on my ipad (not my phone since I thought it would be too small to play and enjoy the game) and I have very good internet but every 5-10 minutes or so it keeps crashing. I tried factory resetting which some sites tell you to do for this game but nothing worked. It wasn‚Äôt so annoying at first since as I said I would get 5-10 min of gameplay before it crashed but it was pretty quick to start back up and it picked up right where you left off. But as I get further into the game and get timed challenges with so many enemies to defeat, it would crash at the end and I would have to restart the challenge from the beginning. Please fix this muihoyo cause it‚Äôs almost impossible to do anything with the game crashing.",4

"Don‚Äôt get me wrong- Genshin Impact is one of the most graphically beautiful, well crafted and well plotted, filled out game I have ever played. The stories of each character are full of anguish and sorrow and strife, the views and landmarks breathtaking to say the least and the gacha system and game play well made. But I do have a few problems. For one, there isn‚Äôt a whole lot of diversity. At first they had all white characters, and they have quite a few characters, except for two light characters repeatedly called strange and weird. Now, after all the diversity controversy stuff they have strived to fix their mistake and have added multiple beautiful characters with darker skin. However none of them have dark skin- only light brown. Of course there‚Äôs nothing completely wrong with that, it would just be nice to see more diversity. My second problem is that the plot line is a little predictable. I don‚Äôt know fault the game for that however as it is derived from a manga. My last problem is how unlucky I was. Ughhhh",4
"i absolutely adore this game, i have been playing it for a while and found it before it even got popular, i only play on mobile for right now but there seems to be a glitch in my game, every time i go to complete the wangshu quest it‚Äôll say ‚Äúquest area reached‚Äù but whenever i see the glowing light on the floor that i assume i‚Äôm supposed to press it wont give me the option to press it, i also have another issue, i‚Äôm a rank level 25 but i‚Äôve gained enough exp to have leveled up to rank 26 by now but i am unable too. i was supposed to reach about 4000 exp to level up but i‚Äôm currently at 5000 and it continues to get higher. i am just unable to level up and finish this one quest and it‚Äôs kinda disappointing bc i really enjoy this game. i‚Äôve logged out, i‚Äôve deleted the game off my phone and i‚Äôve even reported it as an issue already but nothing has been fixed so i‚Äôm just stuck:/ which is really upsetting bc this is a comfort game and i wanna continue to story quests but i just can‚Äôt if i cant even get up to rank 26 bc of my games glitch :/",5
"I think this is an epic game, the graphics are unreal and the story is amazing. I just have a problem with how this keeps crashing every time I play, my phone over heats like an oven and I think part of that may be because of its big map and top graphics. Although the game is good, it‚Äôs just really annoying that this just keeps crashing. Even tho this is meant for pc, I think they should make this version just different so it‚Äôs more suitable for the phone. Other then that, this game has no problems and is a great game, and for new players I recommend not wasting all your resources on leveling all your character, first aim to get al l the characters, then play with them, and then decide which ones are the best although in the process you will have to level up some of your characters but you only have to level up your two mains. But until then just save as much resources as you can. You can use the premogems to get wishes which you can use to unlock characters and weapons. Also you can play with friends after adventure rank 16",5
"I‚Äôve been playing since launch. It‚Äôs fun and addictive for a while but the gameplay loop starts to take its toll after you‚Äôve built your 20th or so charecter. The cycle of get currency gamble for x charecter, build charecter to beat content and get more currency to get more charecters may be fun for some. But there is no end game beyond that. This is a gacha game through and through. Overworld rewards are paltry and everything you collect is fodder to feed the rng. Don‚Äôt expect to find a legendary weapon in the woods or suddenly find a quest in a book or anything like that. The combat is fun but the effects can be overwhelming to the point where there‚Äôs nothing but chaos on the screen and you are basically just using the same maneuvers blindly. There are different weapon types but each type works the same within its category, polearm users typically use charge attacks, claymore users spin around etc. combos never really deviate from the normal attack 3 or 4 times, skill then burst, then switch charecter rinse and repeat. It has great graphics and if you love anime girls/boys you‚Äôre gonna love collecting but that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the game.",3
"I loved my first couple of months playing this game. The world and characters are rich and well crafted, especially for a mobile feature. Unfortunately, the drop off past AR50 is stark. The game is clearly designed to get you to form addictive habits and normalize casual spending, and it‚Äôs dark the way these patterns manifest. Perhaps even more importantly, the dev team has completely ignored user feedback about a wide array of bugs and issues, including auto-targeting problems, lack of constellation toggles, resin gating for time gated content, diminishing rng returns in domains, etc. I would recommend this game up until AR50, but then run far far away, before you get addicted and do something you might regret. Lastly, and just as a side note, the management team for this game is completely non-responsive to the playerbase, basically insulting us with their silence in the face of outcry about pervasive issues and insulting mechanics. Better management is needed asap. Corporate greed is ruining this game, just like everything else in this world. Where are the tech otakus to save us? Just my 2¬¢. Fingers crossed we see change soon! If so I‚Äôll gladly return!",2
"Why does this game have to require me to spend so much money in order to get who I want when I do decide to spend money I worked for. I just spent 165 dollars for venti and got jean and a bunch of 4 stars instead of venti. I don‚Äôt need jean I need venti for my xiao but now I just threw 165 dollars down the drain for this game. I just want the rate of getting the feature 5 star to be higher. 100 dollars WITH bonus is enough to get 81 summons, 70 is where you hit soft pity which is a 50/50 chance for a five star but not the feature ones just the select few and him so you could possible get someone other than the one you want. 100 dollars without bonus would get you around 40 summons and if you were sitting at 0 pity you might have to spend 200 dollars just to hit soft pity at 70. These rates for these featured five stars are outrageous and invigorating I want to enjoy characters that come out and be able to get them without spending and outrageous amount of money. I don‚Äôt have time to farm primos every single day since I have school and work somedays so it is highly unlikely that I could farm enough to get someone a want all the time but maybe sometimes.",2
"As you can tell from above, this is my first review on App Store and I have no regrets and am proud that my first review is of Genshin Impact. As an artist, this game encaptures my eyes with its creative character designs and personalities. I love the scenery in the game and it is great for photography. As a writer, the story lore is complex and amazingly funny at times. The dialogue and voice actors in different languages all have their strengths and weaknesses. Their diversity in voice languages and text is another thing that stands out. I have played this game since its early days and I am sure I will continue to play (as a high adventure rank player) despite there being a lack of content at times since I am already up to date with most of the things in-game. Highly recommend for those who like to invest in characters and see them do big damage! I am also F2P and a lucky fellow to get the five stars I want. It's not hard to get five stars (in my opinion) as long as you have the time and patience to farm for primogems.",5
"Hi i‚Äôm pretty og in this game, I started playing around a week after it came out. But ever since the anniversary rewards incident genshin had been getting a bad wrap, I know i speak for the larger community when i say we don‚Äôt want people to lose their jobs or have other games taken down. That vocal minority are not and do not represent the larger community. Genshin is a game about exploration in the early game, then it turns into a study game where you figure out how the different systems in the game work, and then it becomes a routine. I‚Äôve loved this game since it came out and will continue to love it but if you don‚Äôt enjoy the game, or the community please don‚Äôt attack mihoyo or anyone affiliated with them. Even if genshin has some scummy money grabbing tactics avoiding those is something we‚Äôre just going to have to deal with in the world we live in. I didn‚Äôt expect to come here and say all this but i truly do love this game and anyone looking to give it a try definitely should

sincerely

"I really like this game, but I just had a terrible run in with their customer service. I‚Äôm pretty sure their customer service is completely automated or something. So I was trying to buy a $100 pack so that I could try to get Hu Tao and since this was my first purchase, I‚Äôd have the first time buyer bonus. However, right after I bought it, it failed and charged my card. Tried logging out and reliving to no success. Because of that, I asked my credit card for a refund. However, later I eventually received the full amount of the primogems plus I got my refund. But because of this, I received a notice that I had tried to do refund abuse, blaming me and then also putting a negative balance on my primogems. I thought this was fine but when I tried to ask if I could still reinstate my first time bonus since I basically did not get to buy it, their customer service line basically did not answer my question and kept on blaming me for refund abuse when it was clearly a glitch on their game. Never have I seen such terrible customer service. Ridiculous! I‚Äôm not sure if Mihoyo just doesn‚Äôt care at this rate since they‚Äôre raking in millions of dollars, but this is definitely not sustainable.",1
"Wow where do I even start? This is a great game for a lot of reasons! For one, there‚Äôs a giant world to explore with endless side quests and treasures to find! If you‚Äôre trying to level up you could do things such as fight monsters, do daily commissions, side quests, co-op, or challenges. Basically there are endless things to do! And with all the characters and weapon upgrades there‚Äôs always something to work toward. I myself have spent a few hours fighting monsters trying to get primogems to get characters. On the subject of characters, I think the idea of a completely chance-based system to get a character makes the game a lot more fair than games that just let you pay to get them. If I have any complaints, it‚Äôs that it can be difficult to get enough primogems to do wishes. Sure if you grind enough challenges youll eventually save enough up but maybe it would be better if we could get a few more per chest. Like maybe instead of 2 per common chest, it could be 5? Well I‚Äôm rambling- uh this game is great, download it!",5
"I downloaded this game the day it came out, and I gotta say I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised. The gameplay is pretty good and simple, the music is nice and fitting, the graphics are great for a mobile game, I like the anime aesthetic, the voice actors are good(at least the japanese ones), and open world games like this are my favorite. It feels like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but with magic. The story is relatively engaging and there are mechanics that make it feel like a survival game, like cooking, climbing and hunting. Some downsides I can think of are that the game is really big. Right now, it‚Äôs sitting at 7.12 GB of storage and took around half a day to download. Another downside is the rarity of the good characters. I have pulled quite a few times so far (around 30-40 times) and have gotten no characters, only items. And the last downside I can think of is that sometimes when alot is going on, the FPS drops like crazy, but that‚Äôs expected for such a big game. Overall though, this game is good enough to get 5 stars from me.",5
"The game is overall fun when there‚Äôs a new event or you‚Äôre a new player. Although there‚Äôs a few issues that I think that should be worked on. The primo gem system is overall not very good and annoying to collect. Leveling up to high levels is really annoying because after playing for so long you get only a bit a mora, a few xp books and one or two standard banner wishes. It‚Äôs overall bad for that system. But the most thing I dislike is how much space this game takes up. Sure it‚Äôs a good game to grind and play but it‚Äôs not worth deleting important images and apps just to update it and just fill up your phone and make it overheat. Besides all of that I liked the early game better. Edit: another issue I have thought about is genshins lack of dark skinned characters. Sumeru is based off an area where people often have lots of melanin in their skin but most of the released characters are as white as paper, even the archon. The npcs of sumeru themselves are darker. It has gotten to the point where I think hoyoverse is just racist with the lack of appreciation towards people of color.",3
So I was playing this right next to my nagatoro body pillow and I was having fun looking at the characters boobs when I had a strange urge to touch little kids. The urge was so strong that I had to go to the restroom to splash water on my face in order to get focused on my Wafuis when I noticed in the mirror I had a heavily scarred and acne filled face atop a triple neck with a neck beard. I was so horrified at the site that it made me back away to my restroom scale. After I stepped on the scale I look down to see that I gained 403 pounds even though I was 167 pounds just 10 minutes ago. I am currently typing this in my restroom and I‚Äôm gaining pound as you read this. I tried to call for help but my phone had 37 viruses from all the porn videos I downloaded. I tried to go outside but for some reason I have an intense fear of touching the green things covering the ground. Please send help I‚Äôm scared and can no longer move now and I can‚Äôt fit through the restroom door. My wafuis and body pillows must miss me so please send help!,4
"A lot of people get angry over things that I personally think are a tad bit odd. Like the game isn't about collecting waifu‚Äôs or a massive co-op fest. 

 Its a single player game with an amazing story and lore that has a gacha system. You don‚Äôt need to pay to win, you can beat every boss with just the first 4 characters. 

 The story is beautiful and as a person with siblings I can relate to it a lot. I love the people we meet along and way and I love learning about everyone‚Äôs background

 I love the open world too; its so expansive and amazing. The characters fit in with the world it isn‚Äôt like the world or characters are too realistic or too cartoon‚Äôed to fit.

 I enjoy the long journey and look forward to the future nations. The character‚Äôs are all so unique and pretty, and I have hope there will be character‚Äôs with darker skin in the future.

 I also love the cooking and teapot area! The food looks so good, and I love the details added to it. The teapot has so much potential and I hope they increase the amount you can have in a room.

 Although the system can be annoying I‚Äôve been playing for about 9 months and got 34 characters without spending. You can get the character‚Äôs you‚Äôd like if you try hard or i suppose get lucky.

 The only thing I‚Äôd hope for is the option to replay cutscenes they must have took so long to make and I‚Äôd like to see the traveller as she fights Dvalin with Venti again!

 I‚Äôll be a long term player! Ty for your game Hoyo!!",5
"This game has been one of my favorite games of all time, I started over a year ago and the quality and detail of this game is insane. What my problem is that out of 51 characters, not even Including the sumeru characters, there are no darkskin or even darker characters, the darkest character is Kaeya and he‚Äôs barely tan. I understand that liyue and inazuma are both Asian based nations but the fact that not one of mondstadts characters or sumerus new characters are even slightly dark, there have been many people who have brought up this point and that many people are getting fed up with how no one at hoyoverse seems to want to listen or take action. this is 2022 we should not be having to constantly remind you that there needs to be a wider range of skin tones. also the fact that hoyoverse is reusing the same models over and over again, and I feel like the character designs are getting a bit lazy. It feels more like just putting random characters out there to make money. It‚Äôs a shame that such a great game is ruined by the limited diversity and ignorance that the hoyoverse team is projecting.",3
"Honestly Genshin Imapact is an beautiful game but the problems I have currently is the lag and the controls. Every time I need to fly up with the wind shooting up in the air to help you fly up is very annoying.I try to fly up but I always get lags and it just puts me against the wall and I fall down and my charachter dies. I feel like this game is just so frustrating. I try to find out why the lag happens but my internet is fine and it always says ‚Äúreconnecting to server‚Äù and it‚Äôs so annoying when this happens because I have to go all the way to the first spawn point and  I had and go back to where I need to go. Honestly I have been trying to make myself like Genshin,and I do! It‚Äôs just the game I feel like is so frustrating especially with younger kids and it can make them rage quit üòÖone time I was in a mission and I was 334 m away from my destination but then a HUGE lag happened and I went back to the start at 500 and I was sad because the monsters I had to fight on the way were so hard to defeat! Well that‚Äôs all I had to say. Hope this helps!",4
"A lot of the 1 star reviews have to do with scaramouch (however you spell his name), not getting the 5 star character you wanted, taking too much space, and laggy. Scara is not even out yet so that‚Äôs a dumb review, the banner character is not a guarantee and this is a gacha game so deal with that, I play on an iPhone and haven‚Äôt needed to delete or uninstall apps so idk what device people are using, and I only lag when my wifi is at one bar. Every other time my phone is perfect and doesn‚Äôt overheat. Don‚Äôt quite me but this game was initially intended for pc and mobile. They knew it would take up a lot of space later on. Why do you think golden apple was deleted? So that it already had space to bring in Inazuma. This game surpassed phone storage a long time ago and is slowly becoming pc and console games only. All the lag and overheating and storage problems are mobile only. Mobile is limiting this game and that should be a basic understanding we as consumers should see.",5
"Genshin has kept its reputation high and was known for being an incredible game but 2.1 released and anniversary was near, unfortunately the rewards was then announced and as they already know it was terrible spawning a large amount of hate me being included. It feels like a spit in our face and this is one reason why I‚Äôm giving it such a low score. Not only that but every new inazuma character that released had massive flaws like Baal not working with beidou or Yoimiya not being able to cause explosions with her own ult. And not only that but they actively ignore characters that need reworks or buffs. It‚Äôs infuriating to see all this happen and now the community is even having its own little war, with the white knights defending this and with the people who are actively going against this unjust treatment from mihoyo. Worst of all mihoyo is trying to ignore the hate of the anniversary rewards and is hoping that everyone else will forget too but they won‚Äôt this will be like a scar on mihoyos reputation showing the world that they acted like a greedy company. I‚Äôm hoping things will get better and that mihoyo gets their act together again and compensates us with actual good rewards. Anyways I was bored and just wanted to vent.",1
"So I‚Äôve been playing since the second week of release. I saw this game as a side game, not my main game (*ahem* insert ID5‚Äôs rip-off of a game) which REALLY affected me in the long run. I‚Äôm behind while others are at AR56 and I‚Äôm at AR45‚Ä¶ This game is jam packed with content if you‚Äôre a beginner! Us since release players didn‚Äôt really‚Ä¶ but if you consider joining now, please do! The main key is to collect the characters you love, not the meta (though of course your account can be based on that). I have Venti who I wanted since release but I couldn‚Äôt accumulate enough primogems so I ended up getting our wind god at his rerun! This game is mainly based on doing activities such as adventuring to untouched or top-secret areas. It can get political which is my favorite tbh (bc you don‚Äôt deal with right wingers or leftists hehe). The only downfall this game has is the fact it heats your phone up pretty badly. I have an iPhone X 256gb so it‚Äôs not my storage but just the game. It‚Äôll crash sometimes but it‚Äôs mainly only after you‚Äôve played for more than 3+ hours on mobile.",4
"Hello! I have played for idk how long but I would love if you had more free characters and more male characters! Then more rerun so people could get the characters they would want! Like have the Endora available for people who missed the event, because I missed it by three to two days!! I am grinding to save for xiao and zhongli but I gave up after I found out they may not have a rerun. Not having a rerun you might as well make them a 4 star so that people can get them while you add more five stars to your game to free up space so people can have characters they want tooo! People wants to trade characters but CAN‚ÄôT I know people can get scammed and what not but I seriously suggest making old five star characters into new 4 star because if you keep adding 5 star what little or left 4 star characters people will have and it‚Äôll get boring and people quit. Over all the game is fun but I suggest those ideas and LET US PET THE DOG AND CATS PLEASE

Update:

Hey Genshin please fix this bug about the pre-installing I did it and now I can‚Äôt update my game",4
"i love it so much and i‚Äôm super addicted. this may seem like a super small issue but whenever i get notifications that say ‚Äúoriginal resin replenished‚Äù ITS NEVER REPLENISHED. i will have like 30 resin and be disappointed. i‚Äôll see the notification and then log on to make condensed resin but i don‚Äôt even have enough resin to make condensed resin.... also as someone who plays this game excessively i‚Äôm a high adventure rank and it gets to the point where there is just NOTHING TO DO. i‚Äôll log on and do my faults for like half an hour and then log off and it‚Äôs so disappointing but that‚Äôs really just because i‚Äôm a no life lol. i‚Äôm a zelda freak and this game does remind me of zelda but is unique at the same time which is why i really like it but i would like it even more if it was released as a finished game with a whole storyline and plot with more story quests. i like being able to COMPLETE a game like this but we‚Äôre just left on a cliffhanger with every story quest that gets released. :,)",5
"This game is amazing, I love it so much. But I‚Äôm gonna get to the point, I think that everyone should get a new type of character, preferably a shifter type. And some side stealth missions. Shifters can shift into other forms(hilchurls, cats/dogs, other enemies) and stealth missions are unlocked at adventurer rank 15. Stealth missions are missions that require a stealth character(shifter) and you can buy a shifter for 1500 primo gems. I feel that‚Äôs a good price, or put it in a pack so people can get it with primo gems. I would love it but give a higher chance of getting a character because I rarely get any characters with wishes. I am adventurer rank 18 and I only have my base 4 and 4 other characters. I wish I had the chance to get a small character but that‚Äôs besides the point. I really enjoy this game and I‚Äôm sure others will too. This game just needs a little push to get even more popular and that‚Äôs exactly what I think this game needs. Thank you for reading this! Much appreciated, and thank you!",5
"Alright, this has got to be the BEST game I‚Äôve ever played on my phone. It‚Äôs incredibly immersive, expansive and so finely-detailed for a game that‚Äôs adapted to the iPhone. It‚Äôs like playing an actual console game on your phone. No lagging, no annoying ads to watch or skip, no required in-app purchases or pay-to-play/win nonsense. It‚Äôs got a Zelda BotW vibe, mixed-in with maybe some Kingdom Hearts/Final Fantasy elements. 

The developers put so much detail in the game, and it shows. There‚Äôs voiceovers, a free-roam environment to explore, tons of quests to complete, etc. Honestly, I‚Äôm blown away that this game is free. Games like this is so rare nowadays, where develop quality games for others to enjoy first and foremost, and cashing in on the game from it being less of an emphasis. Not saying we all deserve free games, but it‚Äôs easy to see how money-hungry game developers are nowadays, and are willing to churn out a mediocre game year after year for the sake of money, and expecting people to pay top dollar for them.

I HIGHLY recommend this game.",5
"I‚Äôve really enjoyed the exploration and the story aspects of this game. But man the grind! You literally need to plan your days around grinding for mats for characters and weapons as only certain mats are found on certain days of the week. Some of the larger non story quests have huge, visible impacts on the world around you but are never mentioned in the main story or by most NPCs. It takes you out of the immersion. Also although it‚Äôs mostly unneeded to enjoy the game, the gotcha system is the most unfair, inaccurate mess of a lie and in todays age I‚Äôve no idea how they‚Äôre getting away with it. Part of the issue is they mix weapon with character pulls and another huge issue is you can pulll 100 wishes and not get a single character. 

I‚Äôve really enjoyed the story for the most part, I wish there was a skip button for some stuff though that isn‚Äôt that engaging though. I could nitpick more but honestly between the grind and the unreal gotcha mechanics I‚Äôm thinking about uninstalling it and just watching lets plays instead or wait until the anime comes out.",3
"ok so I've played this game since April 2021 and it‚Äôs really good could use some fixer uppers but so far so good, i have a few ideas for the game. (1) there are animals all around the regions i‚Äôd be nice if we could interact with them like petting them or playing fetch or stuff like that. (2) if your a low ar you could choose a different lvl up mat instead of the main one like say you ar 27 and you get Yun Jin but you cant ascend her well you can choose by changing it by maybe killing geo enemies. (3)
add more interactive places like the bath house in inazuma we‚Äôre you can go in and it‚Äôs like a spa or hot springs and there‚Äôs restaurants we‚Äôre the player can eat at. (4) characters that you have that are on the map like albedo at his camp xiao at the inn,razor out near wolvendom , kokomi at the shrine, raiden at her palace? (correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) etc. (5) comms, so you know how we get 10 primos every comm it be nice if we could get 20 or make it to we‚Äôre we get one wish a day i think that could really help with f2p players",5
"I love this game! I have it it on mobile and on PC. Though the main problem that most people are complaining about is,storage. It is true that it takes up a lot of storage but it didn't bother me. What is really good about this game is the story, how it works, and how frequently it updates! The story- the story is rich in action, and the plot is very good. How it works- the instructions are very clear and the player (hopefully) understands clearly. Updates- the updates aren't just ""fixed bugs"" there us much more, it updates almost every month and the updates are very interesting (see the newest updates!) 
There is one problem that isn't that big of a deal but may be infuriating to others, it crashes too much. When I first started it crashed like every 10 mins or so. It made me very frustrated but then after a bit it became a mild issue.

Thank you for reading my review! Hope you have a good morning,night,evening,or whatver time it is!",5
I‚Äôve been really enjoying the game so far on my phone. One of the biggest draws is that you build your party to your play-style. I love being able to switch to various party members to maximize the elemental combinations. You do have to be a bit lucky at times in getting characters that work for you but it‚Äôs fairly easy -so far- to get the means for the 10 items ‚Äúwishes.‚Äù It‚Äôs primarily single player ‚Äúworld‚Äù that allows you to have other join your world (or you theirs) once you reach a certain level so you have the option to co-op. There are times where certain mechanics are frustrating (you dodge an incoming attack that hits anyway and it becomes a chain of knockdowns with no escape) but that happens with any game. This is one of the few games that seem truly f2p and is one of the few games that has earned my respect enough to debate donating. I just wish the formatting of the PS4 account linking would allow for cross-save between mobile and the console,5
"So I was skeptical about this app at first. I don‚Äôt play many ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù games or games that required payments and money to win/advance: this game is totally different! No adds or anything bombarding you to buy something!! You just dive in and play the game. Just focus on 2 main DPS. Have a support and an extra. Manage your resources and you‚Äôre good to go! Also, there is no rush to be on leaderboards or anything like that at this time. It‚Äôs an actual game with a ton of content. I‚Äôm new to the game. Just a few days into it. AR20 and I can say the story and side quests so far is amazing and I love the open world concept. Also, it‚Äôs amazing I can play in my laptop to give my phone a break! I only have 8 characters or so but each one is unique and combining elements is awesome to weaken foe. Can‚Äôt wait to get further along in the game and enjoy the content that comes out! So much to do in this game as well! I also like seeking out achievements and this game has a lot so far! I just hope it doesn‚Äôt turn into a gotcha game and remains as good as it currently is.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing over a year, and it‚Äôs a fun game honestly. There‚Äôs a lot of content for beginner/mid players and the community can be really helpful with exploring and building characters. The stories are heart wrenching at times and the scenery is absolutely stunning. But unfortunately there‚Äôs a lot of issues that need to be fixed. The teapot load limit, characters lack of diverse skin tones, sexualization of characters (women and children) and lack of content for late game players who have finished all of the quests. The adventure rank rewards are really sad as well, you‚Äôd expect to at least receive a ten pull for reaching adventure rank 60 but you only get a few blue wishes. Getting characters you want can also be extremely difficult if you have not saved up months of primos and you are not guaranteed. The weapon banner is a whole other war zone I don‚Äôt even want to get into. So unless you plan on spending money or spending hours of your time (or your whole life) on this game then I wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it. Otherwise, good luck because you‚Äôll need a lot of it.",3
"Honestly love this game to pieces! The world-building and story-telling are both stunning and the visual effects pop off the screen. There are so many cool and unique characters to collect and the levelling up system is easy to use. I like how creative some if the designs are and how much variety there is between characters of the same element. Your gameplay can really change depending on which twin you choose and who you main. I personally like the close-combat style that comes with the sword-wielding characters and a friend of mine likes the ranged attacks, which makes for perfect team gameplay. The multiplayer gameplay is also really nice, although a wish you were able to do a bit more with it story wise. My biggest critic would be that there are so many cats and dogs but no way to interact with them! I wish you could pet them or play with them during downtime. Other than that I love the game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and battle games.",5
i‚Äôve been playing this game since june and i‚Äôve loved every moment of it. the graphics are pretty and i love the story. i go through seasons where im addicted to this game and when I sometimes forget it‚Äôs on my phone lol but I still love the game so much. I can always come back to it and each time I get on it‚Äôs such a fun time. there is always something new too do and even when they added inazuma and I was a bit overwhelmed it still gives me the same awe-stricken feel as when I played the first time. I‚Äôve spent abt 40 dollars on this game and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. only wish I was more consistent so i could get as many primos as possible (hehheheheh im greedy). I also love that I can play with my friends because im so trash at video games I can just call my bestie and she‚Äôll defeat stuff for me (thank u 90). I just have one request plzzzz give us a venti rerun. he is so cringe and peak comedy I need him. thank u and make sure to eat paimon before she goes out of date,5
"I'm really loving this game so far! It's fun and the characters and graphics are awesome! Then, I noticed something... In the storage section in the settings of my iPhone... Genshin Impact takes up more than 3x more storage than the app with the 2nd most storage. I just got it TODAY and it's 7GB already. My next closest is photos with 2GB. I don't think the number will go down. Most likely it will go up as I play more. I wish it was less storage but I tend to use up storage a lot so I can't just games above 5GB. 5 is pushing it but 7 is ridiculous! I like to have all my games within a 2GB limit but if it's one of those can't live without and it's 5GB or less then I'll keep it. But I don't think it's worth the storage take up. If you're on mobile and you don't have a problem with the storage thing then I think you should definitely get this game because it's really cool. But, if you're like me... Then this game might not be worth it to you. I will have to delete this sadly but it's a really great game. Just not worth the storage.",4
"This game has 3 types of people who can enjoy it long term. 1, the casual who literally just wants fun gameplay (which this game has, but please get it on your pc or PlayStation.) 2, the ‚Äúwhale‚Äù who is more than willing to spend $2-3k (USD) to get the best version of the character they want (you make wishes and get characters/weapons; duplicate characters and weapons give ‚Äúconstellations‚Äù and ‚Äúrefinements‚Äù respectively) but you have to get 7 of any character (6 Constellations after you first get the character) to max their constellation. This makes the 5 star characters in the game about $200 to even get a chance of getting them once. All in all, it‚Äôs a good game. But the people who control the prices of Genesis crystals and the amount of event rewards (the games gacha currency) are SUPER selfish. They will not reward you for being part of their community. They will only reward you for giving more money than you should ever give to a game like this.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for a long time and I know how greedy Mihoyo is when giving out free primogems, but this is just sad. Most games would celebrate their first year by being more generous and letting the community have fun. But giving away only 10 wishes and having events or contests where people have to spend hundreds of dollars or spend a lot of time for these contests only for the chance to win the cheap awards or 100 primogems. 100 PRIMOGEMS IS NOT EVEN 1 WISH. I‚Äôve played other faces games that give massive awards during special events, but this is just disappointing. Genshin Impact is a fun game and has some great stories, and this was one of the first games I‚Äôve spent money on. It seems like Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt really care anymore with Baal not collaborating with Beidou and Kokomi just being one of the worst characters in the meta. I really don‚Äôt want to leave this game, but please LISTEN TO US AND DONT INGORE US. The players and content creators of this game deserve that much.",5
"Way back in 2016 I started my first ‚Äúmain‚Äù game. Which was destiny 1. I had a lot of fun up until it died in September 2017. Destiny 2 is just bad so I‚Äôm moving on. Then I discovered warframe and it became my main game for 3 years! But burnout and sickness of the developers actions made me quit. Then on October 19th 2020 I found Genshin impact. I immediately fell in love with it, I explored for 8 hours a day and collected absolutely everything. I‚Äôm still playing to this day, I‚Äôm adventure rank 57 and I‚Äôm still using fischl to this day (got her October 31st) this game filled a void that other games had left and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing. Even if the anniversary rewards are disappointing (aside from the amazing web event that brought back so much nostalgia) I will love this game till it‚Äôs end. Im going to play it until it dies in 5-15 years and I‚Äôll be one of the few 1.0 veterans left by the time it dies. I love this game and I will continue to support it for many years to come. 
Sincerely 
-Syhyronica",5
"It was very fun at the beginning, but once you progress more, you realize how much this game lacks. When you are in co op mode, the only thing you can do is fight. I don‚Äôt even mean domains either. Spiral abyss? Not in co op. Claim adventure rank rewards? Not in co op. Unlock statues? Not. In. Co op. When my friend had to do adventure rank quest, the trial was so long she lost complete battery before completing the electro hypostasis. Which is why I began grinding for her when she couldn‚Äôt. Over the past few weeks, I have been doing her commissions, but every time I have almost killed all 18 monsters? Hahahahaha- NO. The game decides to crash the exact moment I killed it. When I got back in, I had to do the commission. Again. And I had less health than when I tried the first time, and I froze to death in the dragon spine commission.

Enough ranting. Despite all the flaws, I guess the game is still fun, just lacking some features I would like. (As in, Let us do more things in co op please??) I still really enjoy the game, just maybe not as much as before. Please read and consider my review. Thank you HoYoverse!",3
This game is literally the best it has characters beyond your wildest dreams powers and different elements of the characters have you can level up your characters and evolve them but obviously it will make a difference but increase their attack damage and every thing is amazing their design my personal favorite characters are Beidou I don‚Äôt know if I said that wrong‚Ä¶. And my second favorite character has to be Yanfei! Who are also don‚Äôt know if I spelled the name wrong but first person she is a pirate and from what I‚Äôve Heard from the kids in Liyue she gives them snacks and this kind towards them and she‚Äôs just a great captain! Yanfei is a pink haired girl and I want to say she‚Äôs a librarian like Lisa but I don‚Äôt quite know The fights are kind of hard if you‚Äôre going until like a temple but overall it‚Äôs really fun to keep rething and still having the thrill of fighting this game helps you take all your anger out and it‚Äôs just amazing so I would consider downloading it five stars!,5
"How are you as a now global company going to base an entire region off Middleeastern/south Asian cultures and then fill it with paper white characters and orientalist designs? It‚Äôs embarrassing. I loved playing genshin and was looking forward to Sumeru since I saw how culturally rich liyue and inazuma were for example. What did I expect when the only dark skinned characters are kaeya and Xinyan and even Xinyan is stereotyped as being scary? Not to mention those characters are four stars and get no attention. Get it together. I know you have the funds and it isn‚Äôt hard to research. You did it with the previous regions and put in so much effort into Yunjin to accurately showcase Chinese opera. But it comes to Arabs and south Asians and suddenly you drop some stereotypes and call it a day? I saw the WEBTOON with how the one villain looked like a stereotypical Arab. That was the one time they made the character dark skinned, have an ethnic looking nose, and ‚Äútraditional clothing.‚Äù And he was the ‚Äúugly villain.‚Äù I regret ever spending money on this game. It‚Äôs a waste of your time. Even the endgame content itself is nonexistent. Hoyoverse never listens to its fans even after wanting to expand globally. Get it together. Im going to pull for kazuha and wait the ‚Äúsumeru‚Äù characters out.",1
"Let me get this out of the way. First, YOU NEED A STRONG DEVICE to even run this game properly. iPhone 8 Plus and above will do the job. Sexond, the gacha, THE GACHA RATES ARE LOWER THAN FGO. Though you get a lot of currency to pull near the start, I recommend saving and not immediately rolling the gacha unless you‚Äôve already decided to pay up. Third, BE CAREFUL REROLLING, YOU MIGHT GET BANNED because bots are rerolling accounts which are being sold. Fourth THIS WILL BE GRINDY I played in the beta, and most other players will agree, it takes time and many resources to build teams, and I specifically said it with a plural word. Fifth, YOU WILL NEED MULTIPLE UNITS for end game since dungeons have different effects which will benefit specific characters. I think I mentioned most of the things that WILL RUIN most people‚Äôs experience, now for the good stuff. This is MiHoYo‚Äôs third major game, Honkai impact blew my expectations and standards for a mobile game, and I know this will do it again. I wouldn‚Äôt have imagined an open world mobile ga,e like this when I first downloaded Honkai. THIS CAN BE AN AMAZING GAME, it just needs time...",4
"Genshin Impact is a wonderfully thought out game. Just by the loading screen I‚Äôm blown away. Every touch added to the game makes to so much more beautiful. I love the voice acting, the art style, the story and character designs. Each character looks like much time and effort was put into them, along with the story. Each frame of this game is something wonderful and just pure eye candy. Everything about Genshin Impact deserves a 5 star rating. I‚Äôve only just started the game, so I have no complaints what do ever. I have an iPhone 7, and it doesn‚Äôt lag, and the graphics are still very nice. Only thing problem are the cutscenes don‚Äôt load, but there is nothing anyone can really do about it. Like said I have an iPhone 7 so I don‚Äôt expect them to work. But even without the cutscenes the animations and overall the whole game makes up for it. I can tell you guys spent a lot of time into this game, and I thank you for having such dedication to make something so great. I wanna say you‚Äôre inspiring. Thank you for making this game.",5
"My graphics before this 1.3 update have been great even set at medium as the game still looked very sharp. However, after this latest update, when I logged back in, the loading screen and in-game graphics look very weird. The graphics look blurry and are wavy and soft. Also, the pixels (don‚Äôt know what you would call it) surrounding the character and ground seem to slightly shake. The slight shaking and blurriness together makes me feel sick. I have tried toggling with the graphic settings and setting them back to what I had them at, but it still looks weird. I even deleted the app and re-downloaded it because I know that sometimes it will fix itself, but it has yet to do that. I am hoping that this is only temporary and that it does not have to do with my phone (IPhone 8, though still should work fine). Genshin Impact is a lovely game though, and I am really enjoying the storyline and adventure ! This was the only issue that I had, hence the 5 stars. Hopefully it will be fixed next maintenance.",5
"This game isn‚Äôt an ordinary game when I download a game i know it‚Äôs going to have some sort of crappy gameplay but this....
This is the first game I took interest in I love all the characters and I can‚Äôt believe that the game is for free I love the music it gives me motivation to play it more also the games design or graphics are amazing it‚Äôs not that realistic but it‚Äôs looks beautiful I also love the fact that all the characters were thought out well . That option for gliding on a wing glider is very unique you don‚Äôt see that every day in every game . I also like that it‚Äôs a free move around game and you don‚Äôt need to only go in one place I have a suggestion to the developers that instead of using sheer cold why don‚Äôt you give them jackets or clothes which will keep them warm. But yeah this game is still soo good this is the first game I actually payed attention to the quest are different all the time they are not the same that is good and I hope you expand your map of Teyvat even more! farewell Mohio you have done a great job!",5
"I knew nothing of this game until my friend got into the beta. I‚Äôve been following it ever since. I couldn‚Äôt wait for its release. The game itself is fantastic. The music the story, sure it‚Äôs a BOTW clone but it does so much of its own thing that it really stands on its own two feet. The only downside I see to the game at all is the loot box style way of getting characters and weapons. But it is early. I‚Äôm only adventure rank 12. It goes to 60 so who knows what you will unlock along the way with time. That also being said even without 5 star weapons or characters I have had no real issue making it through anything so far so the characters and weapons to me are more of a skin/cosmetics thing then any sort of pay to win if anyone is concerned about that. But even with the one downside I gave it a 5 star and even wrote this review (which I don‚Äôt normally do) because the game is so fun. I own every console and built my own computer I don‚Äôt normally play mobile games but this one got me. It‚Äôs very well done.",5
"I‚Äôll start by saying this I love this game and the fandom and I‚Äôll probably continue to play for a very long time due to the amount of effort and money I‚Äôve spent, however that doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt acknowledge the flaws of this game cause if you‚Äôre looking for a game with a diverse cast of characters regarding skin tones , gender , body types, personalities that aren‚Äôt centered around one thing and various different weapons and play styles , then this game isn‚Äôt for you. However if you‚Äôre not looking for any of those things then feel free to play , just don‚Äôt get upset when every character is paper white , has the same copy and paste body or when the enemies look better and have more unique and interesting kits and designs , because hoyo is a company that tends not to care about any form of feedback offered to they by their supporters all they really care about is money lol . Also don‚Äôt mind the fact that all the children characters are little girls and that they‚Äôre are like 50+ girls and women in each region but only 6 guys . Or do mind it doesn‚Äôt matter Hoyo won‚Äôt care ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3
"This is my third‚Ä¶ and last‚Ä¶ attempt to play this game. 
The game starts out good with lots of things to do but‚Ä¶. Then it just peters out into glitchy lameness. 
Every time; once I advance to adventure rank 30 and world rank two; without fail, the characters start acting weird and become almost uncontrollable during battles as the view automatically changes to where you are staring off somewhere else as you are being pummeled by ‚Äúenemies‚Äù and can never get the viewpoint to face a battle or the character becomes so touchy while navigating precision steps that it does stupid things like jumping off cliffs for no reason other than I move forward and the character steps directly off the edge‚Ä¶.beside me NOT forward. 
The ruin guards‚Ä¶ why in the heck do they, in the middle of a battle with over half damage, just disappear to respawn at full power again? My character (Amber) maintains all the damage from the battle while having to beat the same exact ruin guard 3 times because it keeps respawning. 
I feel like the game is DESIGNED to ‚Äúcheat by glitches‚Äù once you reach a certain level.",3
"this is probably one of my favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite mobile game. the graphics are beautiful, the characters have unique designs, the character models look amazing, the fighting mechanics are fun, and the story is interesting & compelling. my only complaints are how often it crashes and how it lags sometimes? im aware that this is because the game has such a big file size (which is another issue, the game is 12 GB), so i have a suggestion for that; the voice lines in the game take up about 35% of the file size (yes, really), and most players only use 1-2 voiceover languages. it'd save a lot of space if players had the option to undownload the languages they didn't use; for new players, they could choose which voiceover languages to download and not download. i'd also like more ways for f2p players to farm primogems!!
tl;dr: amazing game, but not recommended for old phones or phones with less than 60 GB of storage. it's on ps4 and pc for free, so maybe get it there instead",5
"The game is definitely worth getting. I recommend that the primogems (in game currency) be saved up until player level 20 or so just to get a grasp of what the game has to offer. It‚Äôs a gotcha game so summons are always pretty much rigged. You gotta be lucky or spend money until you hit their pity. I know the game is unfinished but they need to work on boss difficulty when four players are able to join in together in one world. The bosses at that point gets killed in 2 seconds and there‚Äôs pretty much nothing to do after spending your daily 160 resin. There‚Äôs not really any point in co op mode because the game itself is easy to cheese through solo. They need to focus on end game more than anything else. The only thing still keeping high level players playing are the mini events. Even so, they log in for a couple of days and finish the event. I hope this game isn‚Äôt just about a lot of characters and easy difficulty. Then it‚Äôll be another trash game like warframe. There‚Äôs no point in playing with no difficulty.",5
"Let me start by saying that I am AR40 at the time of this review. The gameplay and story are amazing. The gacha aspect is a hit or miss with their low rates. However, once you get past the honeymoon phase of the first 20-30 hours, you will start to realize that miHoYo designed the game in a way that limits the player‚Äôs progression in every single way possible. From the smallest thing such as crafting ores to level up your weapons to spending resin for running dungeons and bosses to get ascension materials. They limit it all. It‚Äôs like they are trying their best to prevent players from progression in an OPEN WORLD game. Some might argue that the game is design as a mobile game. The funny thing is that playing on mobile is the hardest compared to playing on PS4 or PC. Furthermore, I have never seen a greedier company than miHoYo. They made $100 million (their entire production cost) in the first 2 weeks, yet they don‚Äôt have any sort of daily login rewards outside of the initial 7 days and when they do send out codes for rewards or host events they give you crumbs - not even enough for a single gacha pull. I hope to see big changes soon because they seem so inexperienced even though they have another game Honkai Impact for the past few years.",1
"I would just like to start off by saying an amazingly well written and programmed game. I play both on PS4 and mobile but far prefer the console version. This game is a true open world game which is rare in games nowadays, with the amazing storyline and side quests. If I had any complaint about it, it would be about the fact that after level 20 leveling up gets increasingly difficult, repetitive and time consuming. Most side quests have to be found by just walking around I would like it more if you added more features to the map like possible side quests or explorable areas for more experience points to help with leveling. I also feel like there should be more mobs it gets a little repetitive fighting the same kinds on repeat though I understand since the game is fairly new. The last thing I would add is a monster dossier that‚Äôs probably one of my favorite thing about games I love being able to see all monsters I‚Äôve fought/unlocked and also a little backstory on them.",5
"first off i just wanted to say this game is amazing. they really payed attention to detail with some things that have heavily peaked my interest, therefor making me want to play even more. although, i am only a mobile user! i play on my iPhone 8, before (a few months ago) i tried playing this but it just led me to a black and white screen. im not sure what fixed the issue because after i waited 2-3 months for it to be fixed and it started working after i get an update for my phone? anyways, the bugs i deal with on a daily basis NEEDS to be fixed because it‚Äôs the small things ruining my gameplay. sometimes, when i‚Äôm fighting monsters, it lags a whole lot and the day switches to night, and the night switches to day. that happens about 3-4 times. it‚Äôs really annoying. whenever it‚Äôs raining for me, my game lags and crashes. and everytime i go into monstatd, the graphics become blocky, and i have to restart the game in order for it to be good again. amongst all these small bugs, i still enjoy the game. but PLEASE please please fix this. thank you",4
"When I first started out playing genshin I had pulled a five star on the starter wish banner and I got venti but than I stopped play for quite a bit and i had lost the account by kissing the password to it I was really sad that day but I 
Hiked up the courage to make a new account then I started all over again and no I did unfortunately didn‚Äôt get venti back from pulling for him but I was glad I decided to give genshin another try and now present day I have made a second account because I got board and k no one my phone with holds that account and my pc with holds my main account I‚Äôm glad I had downloaded and heard about genshin because if I didn‚Äôt I would have still been that same person I used to be back then a plain boring person the didn‚Äôt know anything about whatever she was thinking. I‚Äôm glad that genshin is it‚Äôs own thing. This journey has gave me may happy memories for me and my friends hope to continue playing till the very end. üòä",5
"When I first saw this game, I mocked it, failing to see what was special about it. It looked like an attempt to connect an anime artstyle to an open world rpg. Months later, here I am practically addicted to this game. The world of Genshin Impact is such an immersive and enjoyable experience I‚Äôm sure most people will be able to find something they‚Äôll enjoy. There is a solid story with great characters, a beautiful world featuring great scenery and music, enjoyable battle that‚Äôs easy to get used to, and gorgeous characters you can potentially add to your party and grow stronger with. Yes, this is a gacha game, but once you start playing, it‚Äôll hardly feel like a gacha game. A lot of people put too much emphasis on the gacha aspect of the game, and end up spoiling for themselves everything that makes the game great. You needn‚Äôt focus entirely on the wishes, the game has so much more to offer. If you‚Äôre looking for a great game to dive into, then I‚Äôd recommend giving Genshin Impact a try. 
p.s. ‚≠êÔ∏èBennett is absolutely amazing ‚≠êÔ∏è",5
"i‚Äôve been playing the game for a year now.. at first it was wonderful, i‚Äôd play it during class and any time that i could, i took a small break because it got boring, then an uprise of players joined and i started again. we got this game on the leaderboards and still got nothing. i get that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt owe us anything‚Äù but we‚Äôre the ones paying their bills and Mihoyo does nothing but spit on us and smush us into the ground. your gatcha percentages are terrible, your game is repetitive and terrible(feels more like a chore that i have to play to have a 0.6% chance to get a good character, that might not even be the event character), and you are the most selfish and greedy company ever. you‚Äôve proven you know what 1st year anniversary gifts to give through Honkai, and yet you give us the rewards we got during the lantern rite event. Genshin is the most stingy gatcha game i've ever played. Not to mention how they have NO fat characters(even characters that could canonically be fat, like ganyu) and they‚Äôre only black character they give no screen time, and when she does get screen time she‚Äôs whiter then venti. Genshin boot lockers hate me all you want, but genshin is terrible and not worth putting any money or time into the game.",1
I have put in about 40 hours of gameplay so far. Haven‚Äôt spent a dime but I have quite a few characters unlocked from playing the game. Sure you could easily dump some money in the game to get the characters you want but they give you plenty of currency in game. I find myself making a ten times pull every other day at this point. I know early on this will be easier to do with the rewards in game for the launch but you don‚Äôt have to spend a dime to enjoy this game. The graphics are great the story and lore has been fantastic. There‚Äôs so much to learn and the characters you talk to fill you in on a lot of the worlds background. The voice acting has been awesome and the soundtrack is so good I have to play with my sound on always. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect when I installed the game even though I was waiting for it to release. Any expectations I had have been completely blown away. I‚Äôve been telling everyone to get this game. You have to try it you have nothing to lose but your free time,5
"A year or two ago, I was suffering from absolute boredom. My friends, who were also suffering, tried finding games we could all play together. We met some people online via some social networking apps, and were introduced to Genshin Impact, the game with walking- no, floating- emergency food. We all quickly got addicted, but had to take a very, VERY long break due to school. During that period of time, we eventually forgot the game even existed, and ended up not playing for many months. I eventually got back into it after discovering some of my favorite influencers played it, and started grinding. The wishing system and animation is great, the characters are adorable( and, if I may, hot), and the player base is filled with awesome people. Building characters is relatively easy if you just search up how or if you know how to, but the game can sometimes be tiring. I look forward to playing with you all for many updates to come.",5
"- AR. 58 - playing since day 1

Honestly, the only thing I look for in a game are good graphics and design. For me, genshin is the model of that right now. Yes, I know there‚Äôs problems in the game, like any other game, and yes, I would like more endgame content, an expanded co-op feature, more resin, and a better artifact system (My suggestion is to make artifact domains similar to talent and weapon ascension domains. For example, make Emblem of Severed Fate on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday & make Shimenawa‚Äôs Reminiscence on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Sundays will allow you to choose which artifact set you want. This will allow players to farm artifacts the same way since you can make condensed resin on off-days while removing a layer of RNG). However, I am fine with the state of the game right now because the quality of almost all the content (hangout events are a little boring, but it‚Äôs such a small part of the game that I don‚Äôt mind) that comes out amazes me.",5
"I love this game so much and have been playing since the very beginning. I didn‚Äôt really notice this issue in the beginning because i‚Äôm aware of the different cultures being offered to us and how it‚Äôs less than likely for there to be large groups of darker skin characters or poc. But given that we are about to receive an update that gives us a new chunk of world that explore (a part of the world that is HEAVILY influenced by south asian / Egyptian culture) the lack of diversity is SO disappointing. My expectations for this company are already low but if you‚Äôre going to pull inspiration from a culture SO diverse and a culture that includes skin tones of all shades, you need to match that with the characters that are playable to us as well. There are only 3 TAN (no darker than just tan‚Ä¶) playable characters that I know of and none of which are 5 stars‚Ä¶ compared to the 50+ characters that are pale or white. It‚Äôs so disappointing because it seems like something people have been complaining about a lot recently and we were still met with no improvement for Sumeru‚Ä¶ I really hope there are darker tones characters added to this game in the future otherwise I fear I‚Äôll have to put it away.",1
"Ok so honestly this game is fantastic. The story line is enthralling and fresh. Not to mention the amazing art quality and art. I also never fail to be impressed by the writers. Everywhere you look you can find little snippets of lore and mythology. It has a little bit of something for everyone. But, it‚Äôs missing on key element; it‚Äôs incredibly difficult for casual gamers to get into. If you don‚Äôt have the time to get on almost every single day and do your commissions and battle pass it‚Äôs hard to collect the materials that you need to advance in the game. From Liyue to inazuma there is an insane leap in difficulty. And the fact is, if you didn‚Äôt invest either time or money or both into the game it is hard to advance the story. Not that a game shouldn‚Äôt have some level of difficulty but I think that it would benefit from being a little kinder for players who enjoy the story line but aren‚Äôt super into the experience of mindlessly grinding for materials or studying game mechanics. 

That‚Äôs my two cents on the game. I love it to pieces but it stands to improve in a few areas.",3
"Ok, to start, this is my favorite game in the ENTIRE WORLD!!!  I can NEVER stop playing it it‚Äôs so addicting!!

I only have ONE MAJOR problem with this game; it. Takes. Up. Too. Much. Freaking. Storage!!!!   I usually play on my iPad instead of my phone, bc it has a bigger screen.  My iPad only has 64 gbs while my phone has 128, which is hard.  Anyway, I have almost used up all of my storage and I‚Äôm trying to delete some stuff, and THEN THE NEW UPDATE CAME OUT WITH YAE MIKO AND I WAS LITERALLY WANTING HER SOOOO BAD!!!  So, I logged on to the game with my iPad to get it installed, but what do u know?  It‚Äôs too much storage space!!!  This game without this new update installed on my iPad already takes up 18+ gbs, which is SO UPSETTING!!  Now I have to play on my phone, which is fine fine for now, but when I play games I prefer to have a bigger screen.  

Muhoyo (Now hoyoverse I think), if there‚Äôs ANYTHING u guys there could do abt this big issue I‚Äôm sure a lot of players r having, I would deeply appreciate it!!  Thanks for reading my review!",4
"I‚Äôve always loved fantasy games and open world so when I found this game I was ECSTATIC! I‚Äôve been waiting for a really long time to receive my church mission call and this wonderful game has helped me pass the time. Yes, it is a gacha game which does make obtaining certain preferred artifacts and equipment frustrating at times, but this almost adds to the game‚Äôs charm. There‚Äôs ALWAYS something to do whether that be exploring, upgrading weapons and artifacts and talents, gathering materials, advancing the storyline, hidden or side quests, helping other players in co-op, daily commissions and weekly bounties and requests. Even when you‚Äôve done all you need or want to do in a day, there‚Äôs always more you‚Äôre able to do the next day as your resin replenishes, commissions reset, and expeditions for materials are completed. 
I absolutely love this game and can‚Äôt wait to see what the developers have in store for us in the future! Thanks for reading my review; I hope it was helpful!",5
"It‚Äôs a great game. Like many reviews say, it‚Äôs a free to roam and you sometimes get to choose between different dialogues. At lvl 16, you can play with friends(cross platform too.) you can wish/summon for new characters. If you get a character again, you use them to upgrade your characters constellation. I have seen some people complain about not being able to get a lot of characters. After a while it‚Äôs a bit harder to earn primogems, but only if you don‚Äôt play enough or do any daily commitions. The game is also a gacha related game. You get a percentage chance of getting something. So after so many wishes your gunna get someone. Once you get to lvl 30, you level slow but with inazuma out rn, it shouldn‚Äôt be too slow anymore. AND THE GRAPHICS ARE JUST *CHEFS KISS.* I mean they put a lot into the designs, maps and scenery. Cut scenes are also so pretty. Sometimes I forget that it‚Äôs not reality and sit there sad because it‚Äôs all just a game. But def recommended. Mihoyo makes really good games. The only thing I dislike it the resin and primogems",4
"ill preface by saying i absolutely love this game. the lore, characters and graphics are the reason i continue playing. i along with many others feel like we got a slap in the face in turn for our support because of the anniversary rewards and not to mention its super predatory gacha system that feeds into gambling addictions. at worst it can take a couple hundred to get a character you want, the banners feed of your FOMO. its a shame we are treated this way because this companies audience are the reason they have reached such high places both in status and monetary gain, and by implementing a lower shop value im sure many more people would be inclined to spend. i truly love this game and i wish they took things like the anniversary as seriously as we do. players are just big money signs to them, or free marketing (as we saw when they tried preying on artists and cosplayers.) i am grateful theyre trying to patch things up now, but it still hurt knowing they truly didnt care like we did; it felt like when someone close to you forgets its your birthday or something lol.",3
"I understand that many people right now are very mad at Genshin for no anniversary rewards but put yourself in there shoes you know how much money they would lose if they have given people what they expect? People were saying at least 40 pulls. Yes I understand they gave us nothing but they have absolutely no obligations on giving you anything. They could delete your account for all they care be thankful it was nothing and not something ‚Äúworse‚Äù (like changing my beautiful Venti) It may sound greedy of them to not give us anything, (which In my opinion at least they may have given us a 10 pull) and that they made a ton of money of certain characters but they need the money to pay the programmers, designers, actors, dubbed actors, and new updates, funding for other stuff like conventions or advertising. So before you go on complaining you got nothing think back and step into there shoes for once and see both sides of the situation.",5
"Ive been playing this game since February and have invested around three hundred dollars in the game. There are many things I like about genshin, but many more things I dislike about its company, Mihoyo. Mihoyo, even compared to other gacha games of lesser popularity and content, is a greedy company and this has been proven with the recent anniversary rewards.

I‚Äôm very active in the fandom and we were all very excited about the anniversary rewards, but mihoyo has failed our expectations. It‚Äôs been highly successful yet the most mihoyo has decided we deserve is a single ten pull. Some members of the fandom had lofty expectations such as getting a free features five star in addition to weapons and even more wishes, while other thought that the least mihoyo would do was simply give us a standard banner five star of our choice, similar to how they give a limited choice of S Rank Valkyries in some of their special events in mihoyo‚Äôs other game Honkai 3rd. This was the minimum of what I expected from mihoyo, especially since in earlier events such as the Lantern Rite event we were able to get a choice of Liyue four star while also getting a free ten pull.

I have other complaints, but this is the most notable as if recent times",1
"OK so this game is now my top ten favorite game the graphics and setup is so pretty and beautiful the adventures are sometimes a little bit complex but I get over it but anyway a problem came up on my end so I ran out of wishes to wish for Nolle but when I was buying more wishes and it said it was declined idk why but this game is so amazing and cute and I like the people you can meet on this beautiful, wonderful, wild journey and I‚Äôm also having a little bit of trouble getting the clothes for my characters so I was hoping you can check that out and‚Ä¶OH! so I was going to play this one day and my password was gone so I put it back in and it said analyzing so I was waiting and it said to put a puzzle piece on so I did that and it said something something something and it said account frozen for 20 minutes so I waited 20 minutes and I tried again and it said the same thing so I was hoping u could also check that and overall I LOVE THIS GAME!!üëçüëçüòáüòáüòáüíñüíñüíõ",5
"The game looks stunning and has fun gameplay. There are daily rewards and there seems to always be something to do even after finishing all your quests! I‚Äôm impressed that a game like this runs well on mobile aside from somewhat frequent crashes and occasional fps drops. The only negative is that the in app purchases are expensive. You need to spend $300 to be guaranteed a 5*. There is another downside that only applies to the mobile version. Perhaps the pity could require less wishes. Whenever I teleport to mondstadt or Liyue on mobile, the game crashes. I tried teleporting right outside mondstadt and then entering the city from the bridge, however when I go inside the city things aren‚Äôt fully loaded and I crash. However, on PC my game never crashes :)

Edit: This is not much of a mobile game anymore unless you have an iPad. With each update I have to delete apps and photos to try to make space. I enjoy the convenience of the phone but it is no longer playable because it requires too much storage.",4
"this is an amazing game no doubt from the graphics to the gameplay to the plot to every little minuscule detail yet somehow unlike others my game tends to freeze up and lag even when I believe there to be no file corruption sometimes I run a mission and it‚Äôs too much in the game crashes and sends me back to my home screen and then I get back on and it says file integrity has not been corrupted and sends me back onto the game yet after about maybe 15 to 20 minutes it crashes again and then the time shortens to around 10 to 15 and then it continues and continues so on and so forth until I have to delete the game and reinstalled it just so I‚Äôm able to play for at least an hour until that time goes back down to measly 5 to 10 minutes. if anyone can tell me what‚Äôs wrong that be very appreciated, I use a iPhone XR and I have over 200 GB of storage so it isn‚Äôt that I just don‚Äôt know what I can be doing wrong, i used to run the game at 60 FPS but then lowered it to the 30fps and then the game started to crash even faster I don‚Äôt understand anymore",4
"as an ar 56 player, that has been playing since december of last year‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm extremely disappointed with the lack of rewards and communication we have gotten. the company is under a lot of fire right now but they refuse to address anything which hurts to see. i absolutely adore this game. i play everyday, it‚Äôs just really disgusting to see a company that has made MILLIONS upon millions of dollars give us such awful anniversary rewards‚Ä¶ and just rewards in general‚Ä¶ one-two acquainted fates for reaching a new ar level??? that‚Äôs insane. i‚Äôve tried to stay quiet about the awful rewards we have gotten in the past but the whole situation with the anniversary has really put me over the edge, and don‚Äôt even get me started on how the ‚Äústellar reunion‚Äù rewards are 10x better than what we are getting for the anniversary‚Ä¶ as i said i absolutely love this game the storyline, the graphics, the characters all of it‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs really disheartening to see the company refuse to talk about what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶ if this keeps up the game is going to end up losing popularity or even dying‚Ä¶ please please please fix your ways i would hate to see this game go down the drain.",2
"Very fun it‚Äôs full of updates never gets boring very fun!a and dress ups characters and more but if your under 8 or so the game may be a bit hard for you to understand but if have someone helping you may enjoy it I recommend for all ages pretty fun but it‚Äôs very laggy sometimes and you do get kicked out at very random times but that‚Äôs fine! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing the strange ice quest if your new it‚Äôs pretty hard the base is easy to understand and super fun there‚Äôs food,clothes,character,house‚Äôs and exploring and quest if you like that it‚Äôs for all 72 genders I think there is 72 the game is super fun tho I would recommend for ages 8-20 but any other age works like 5-7 you might need a adult to help tho and the game is free you don‚Äôt need to pay like 50 dollars a month it‚Äôs all free but there is some skins you can buy for quite cheap if you want to super fun I would recommend getting this game for all ages hope this helped you!",5
"Trust me Genshin Impact is a great game, it has a beautiful landscape, the lore and story are amazing, and the characters and their designs are irresistible. But the game is not for casual players. If you want a game that‚Äôs easy to play and where it‚Äôs relatively easy to gain levels this game might not be for you. It‚Äôs is also quite aggravating to play this game without spending money but it is doable. All around this game is pretty good but there are still some bugs and voice over flaws in the beginning and it takes a lot of patience to progress in the story, main leveling system, and character leveling. If you want an immersive game that can last you for a while you will probably like Genshin. The update schedule is every 5-6 weeks but don‚Äôt rush through because then you‚Äôll be bored for a while. The character attainment system is very addicting but don‚Äôt get your hopes up because you still might not get the person you want. If anyone reads this I hope it helped! Have a good day!",4
"Initial impressions are very high but like my favorite gum it loses steam quite fast and you end up hitting a wall of grinding and tedium in order to progress. Have no fear just buy the monthly pass or spend money on a battle pass you might say? Both of these things don‚Äôt actually compensate you with progress within the game or speed up the character progression system. Even if you do end up pulling a 5* character later the resources needed to max them out make it feel like less of a good thing and more of a sinking dread of choosing between progressing and gearing or wasting thousands of resin leveling up a new character. 

Mihoyo is this game a collectors game or not? What‚Äôs the reward in spending any money here. I‚Äôve never played a game where I‚Äôve spent so much and gotten so little, I understand there‚Äôs not a lot of content because it‚Äôs new but this monetization strategy might be successful initially but will drive off spenders like me because unless I keep spending I basically have to grind endlessly just to hit a pity banner. 

Until the game improves and they make more significant changes to the resin and summon system id stay away.",2
"I hope someone out there will see this some day, the game is absolutely stunning, in my opinion it‚Äôs on par with breath of wild, and it‚Äôs as close to breath of wild as you can get on mobile but, (and I‚Äôm probably the only person here with this issue) I was raised a devout Christian, and I can‚Äôt play games with elements of magic or dark magic in them, so I‚Äôve never been able to play a game that‚Äôs as visually stunning as this, because of the sorcery and witchcraft which in my religion and culture is strongly banned. I hope one day someone will make a mobile open world game, as beautiful as this, maybe with technology as the ‚Äúsuper powers‚Äù of the characters or mecha monsters, horizon zero dawn had this concept and I still couldn‚Äôt play because I have Xbox, not play stationüòî it would make me so happy if one day, a game as beautiful and expansive as this, with legendary items and characters, could be made without utilizing magic or bloody gory violence. I think such a game would be able to increase its customer base to no end",5
"First off, I haven‚Äôt played the game too much, but from what I have played and continue to play the game is just amazing, the graphics, frame rate and dialogue are truly top notch. And with elements like the open world and polished combat you are sure to have loads of fun! I also want to address the negative reviews, pretty much ignore almost all of them, those reviews are mainly talking about how the game wont open or doesn‚Äôt have controller support. To that I would, chill out. The game has been out for like 2 days and I experienced the same issue with logging in, but after a little while I was able to get in and start playing. It makes no sense to me when people rate a games quality based on the fact they couldn‚Äôt get into it. I understand it‚Äôs frustrating, but that‚Äôs kind of a weird thing to give the game a 1 star when you literally just need to wait a small amount to play. Overall the game takes a lot from BoTW and I‚Äôed say if you download this you‚Äôll absolutely love it!",5
"I been playing for around 20 hours now and I can say that Genshin Impact is probably the best open world RPG you can get. It‚Äôs similar to breath of the wild where you can interact with many of the world‚Äôs elements. The graphic is insanely well done and the storyline is exceptional. Game like this are free because they rely on the Gacha system to profit. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this because the developers put in an insane amount of work and we can support them by purchasing stuff. However, if you are free to play know that in the latter stages, it will get increasingly difficult to progress without spending. I Benn playing for many hours now and haven‚Äôt reach that stage yet. So rest assured that even if you are F2P, you can have a very good time as Genshin impact focused on solo progress and PvE instead of PvP. I spent $20 on the game and progression would still be normal if you didn‚Äôt. Overall this game seems very balance and it‚Äôs clear that the developers put a lot of effort in making this game.",5
"This game is super fun and I enjoy it a ton but there are two things that for some reason annoy me, 1st off the primogem situation, I have to farm hours just to make enough for one wish which I guess is fine but I wish they would just gift us some more sometimes and give a little more after some of the quests like the dragon spine in the mountains one, IT TOOK FOREVER to do that quest and only got 60 gems, which isn‚Äôt close to at least one wish, I know they need to make money because this game is free but dang gift us a little more in the mail or something. And the 2nd thing which is very controversial but the weird kinda racist outtake on some of the game play like the hilichurls, from readings online they seem to base them off people of African culture or something related to that which is very weird and not so go great, I wish they would address the issue and figure out a way to change sometime about it, but I can‚Äôt magically make that happen.
But yes this game is great in general just some of the issues related to that.",4
"I remember when I first started to play this in 2020 hard to believe it‚Äôs been two YEARs I‚Äôve longed on just about every day, I usually don‚Äôt get attached to games but now I‚Äôm like if I didn‚Äôt have this game in my life I wouldn‚Äôt be apart of such an amazing community and not only that but everything about this game is just amazing! Couldn‚Äôt have played a better game in my life, the truth is that I have been in search of a game like this for a while and thanks to this game I have come to the end of my search! Dam hard to believe I‚Äôve been playing this for two years! I remember playing this on Christmas Day trying to get that last check point and hope that my phone battery doesn‚Äôt die or worse take me back to my Home Screen‚Ä¶I had the iPhone 8 which I believe if you have the iPhone X and up you should be able to play this game without issues, I got the iPhone 13 now and it works great! This game has brought me and my friends closer",5
"I was introduced to this game by a few of my friends. I had heard about Genshin impact, but never really felt compelled to try. When I finally did, I was quickly hooked, and I have been playing for almost a year now. The lore and storyline in this game is GREAT, and I love how deep it goes! The fighting aspect is super fun, and one thing that I love about it is that EVERY character can be amazing. In some of the other games I‚Äôve played, you‚Äôre sort of forced to play specific characters because you can‚Äôt get through the content otherwise. In Genshin, if you put time and effort into ANY character, they can become powerful. A lot of people say that it gets boring late game, and I get that. There‚Äôs not as much to do once you‚Äôve explored everything and done all the quests, but I still have fun running around and doing weird challenges. Genshin is a fantastic game that has helped me get through a tough year, and I can‚Äôt wait for future updates!",5
"When you start out its great, the world is really immersive and you get a a lot of things to do and have fun with, especially for a mobile game. 
I‚Äôm AR57 now. Things have kinda took a large turn from there.
Late game besides the every now and then events and weeklies it just gets boring, and practically feels like a chore, and there‚Äôs really only one place to get currency for the gacha system which is a dungeon (abyss) that to be honest is practically impossible once you get to the later floors that are the ones that give you primos again, not to mention the buffs that you get really are just to urge you to spend on their gacha banners.
And don‚Äôt get me started on the lack of diversity, yes the regions are based on certain areas of the world but that doesn‚Äôt give excuse for only TWO playable characters of 50 overall to be TAN. Especially with the new region coming out based on desert and forest areas around the middle east/south asia there‚Äôs no excuse if the vast majority of the characters will be paper white üíÄ
If you wanna get into the game, great! But stay F2P, spending at least for me is definitely not worth it anymore when nowadays Hoyoverse is just making characters powercreeped over eachother.",1
"After watching an ad, I got interested immediately because of how greatly presented it was. The gameplay? Amazing! Great graphics, voice acting(Japanese dub, mmmm), effects, animations and everything else is as awesome.
 They certainly made NPCs and playable characters have a lasting impression as they can play a role in a quest and interact with each other letting us see the social connection between characters more deeply. 
Even the gameplay too, you can choose to do anything: Exploring, defeating bosses, clearing domains, fight enemies, do commissions, do quests,...There are even random events or small tasks given by various NPCs, it makes the game more interesting, you do not have to stick onto the plot too much, you don't have to follow the same route.
 Overall, Genshin Impact is a truly amazing game according to me, it may take a bit of patience and time to grind and unlock characters, it's a luck-based system, keep on trying and you'll have it.(there's no good characters or artifacts, it's just your skill that would determine things)",4
"I've been playing since launch, and am currently AR 57. All the positives you hear about this game are true. The lore, atmosphere, music, combat, everything is great. Unfortunately, all of this is rendered null by an extremely greedy company that has consistently alienated and recently, have tried to SILENCE its own playerbase. Instead, the new content they put out hand us nothing but scraps, and endgame content is already barren as-is. They refuse to listen to our feedback, and as of the current 1 year anniversary event, refuse to give us any kind of worthwhile reward, especially when compared to other gacha games and are currently undergoing damage control by outright deleting complaints off of various social media. Not only that, but the game as a whole is taking a turn for the worse by constantly releasing new characters that have subpart/undertested kits that lack proper synergy, which is incredibly important for this game's combat system. Once again, instead of listening to our feedback about this, we're constantly ignored and basically told to ""take it or leave it."" If that's their philosophy, trust me, before you get in too deep, leave it.",1
"Hi, I have been playing genshin for a long, long time and at this point I‚Äôm on AR 50. I cannot express how much this game has helped me, through even in real life situations. From Diluc talking in riddles, to Paimon complaining about everything in her way, this game is hilarious and I even wish I could spend more money on the game, despite it not being a ‚Äòpay to win‚Äô. Then again, the fact that Genshin is not a ‚Äòpay to win‚Äô is very rare for gacha games if you will, and this makes me happy to see. Most of the things in the game depend on chance, like getting certain characters. You can‚Äôt just go to Paimon‚Äôs bargains, swipe a card, and kill Stormterror or get Diluc to level 100. In Genshin, you have to work for what you have. May I also add, that the character designs are adorable, and they keep getting better and better! The animation is the smoothest I‚Äôve ever seen in a game, and I cannot even fathom how hard the team worked to create, and are improving, Genshin Impact.",5
"I‚Äôve been poking at Genshin Impact the last couple of days. I love the graphics! The character system is really fun too. I love being able to swap between the main character and others to combine elemental powers and find new ways to take down enemies. Being able to climb every where and glide is a lot of fun too. However I will say the mobile controls are a little annoying at times. 

I love that you can summon more heroes to fill out your team. It‚Äôs tempting to use real money to keep pulling for a hero, however it‚Äôs nice that you can earn in game currency to do the same. I look forward to seeing what new heroes they bring to the game.

I haven‚Äôt been able to find anything that suggest this game can use a controller. I play on an iPad Pro and have a lot of space to navigate, but I find when running around the world it‚Äôs hard to pan the camera around with out hitting other abilities or sometimes my thumb doesn‚Äôt register when I‚Äôm tapping on powers to activate. If developers could add controller support I‚Äôd give it a 5 star.",4
"I love this game and have played it for about a year.  I would give this 5 stars except for an issue that I find very unfortunate.  Rewards collection. 

Be careful when looting, their is not an auto loot setting and you can accidentally leave a dungeon without your rewards.  I recently lost high level loot after barely finishing a dungeon.  I needed that loot.  Dungeons at different levels have different ways to collect rewards.  I imagine this occurs because of different devs working on different parts of game play.  Even for something that appears as auto delivery loot often requires you hit a ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù key to get it.  That‚Äôs what happened to me - why can I leave without my rewards?  I didn‚Äôt play it just to look at the rewards.  That loot should also auto deliver to my mailbox as tons of other games do.  

Developers please take a look at providing a consistent structure to rewards collection- it would be a huge help. Then I can focus on actually playing the game!",4
"So I am officially addicted to this game. So much replay ability is very good in a game and this game feels like it should cost money, and deserves a 5 star review. However, as with many games, there is also a problem. The problem with this one is that it fails to run well on lower end devices. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am still addicted to this game. The constant crashes and massive lag spikes don‚Äôt deplete that much from the game itself, as they barely ever screw you over. I wasn‚Äôt actually going to write a review, until the lag spikes interrupted my gameplay. At the Luhua Pool, there is a quest where you have to help a man find his art supplies. However, my lag spike did not load that character. Or the door to the temple. Seeing as there was no door, I walked into the temple, without doing the quest and a supreme lack of oversight. I claimed the chests when they loaded and teleported out. Now I attempted the quest just because I need XP. So here I am, an idiot who opened a door with no chests. So now I can‚Äôt complete the quest. Thanks, game.
Please fix this I need it badly.",4
"The game and it‚Äôs company definitely has shown previously that it can be respectful and interesting when taking inspiration from actual cultures around the world, which further helps the feeling of diversity through its stories. Each nation is rich in lore, and characters are able to have personalities and backstories that can keep you playing. 

However, with the soon to be release of Sumeru, a glaring problem has shown itself to be the very thing I compliment the game for: taking inspiration from actual cultures. Because it‚Äôs one thing to research and explore peoples cultures to use it in a fantasy setting to show the beauty and history of it, and another entirely to then remove any ethnic features from your characters and also make one of them a straight up stereotype of a greedy merchant. This game has been something I‚Äôve followed for a year and a half, and while I was aware at the start that Genshin had a colorism problem I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs gone this far when I really shouldn‚Äôt have been. I‚Äôm not even really excited for Sumeru to drop at this point. I‚Äôm more just waiting to see the fanbase‚Äôs reaction and what‚Äôs going to happen after.",1
"While I was reading the reviews I saw a lot of people saying ‚Äúthis is a P2W game!‚Äù To all those people, I wish you would take a good look at the game. This is a game that is still going. If you are joining late then I can get why you would think it is P2W because of all of the characters. BUT THINK ABOUT IT! Some of the BEST teams out there are made of ALL 4* characters! They don‚Äôt even have to be maxed or have the best artifacts. Those videos that tell you which builds are great are just telling you their recommendations, NOT a FACT that they are 100% always best with those 5* weapons and artifacts. Also, to the people who gave bad reviews because of glitching and other technical issues, please check your storage. I used to have a 16GB Ipad (which was really old) and when I tried Genshin it was pretty laggy, so it may be your storage. Sorry if anyone read all this and had no issues, but this was just really bothering me.",5
"I started this game in version 1.1, so I daresay I know a lot about it.

The lore in this game is PHENOMENAL. I‚Äôve spent hours upon hours just theorizing and exploring the world of Teyvat to learn more about the mystery of what, exactly, is happening, and who the real heroes are. The game provides just enough information to draw real conclusions and make exploration rewarding, but still reveal major bombshells in future updates. I cannot emphasize how interesting the universe and main story is. Even limited time events like both dragonspine events, the unreconcilced stars event, and the golden apple archipelago have been packed with information, stories, and memorable moments.

. The writing for many characters can be surprisingly subtle and nuanced. It‚Äôs almost as if the game offers multiple levels of understanding everything, making the game easy for very casual or young gamers and still engaging for people who love to analyze and break apart stories. 

The environment is utterly gorgeous and only gets better and better. Exploration can feel magical. Even after well over a year of playing, I still regularly discover new things. I haven‚Äôt lost that feeling of excitement, joy, and novelty. (I think the best way to get this feeling is not to play TOO much! You‚Äôll get tired of anything if you play it constantly.)

Overall, I didn‚Äôt enter this game expecting to adore it, but here I am. Looking forward to what else Mihoyo has to offer!",5
"Besides the anniversary drama currently, I would like to throw in that this is a free game and you don‚Äôt even have to play it‚Ä¶ some people act like they have to play it when that‚Äôs not good at all. Having that mindset only gets you stressed. It‚Äôs ok to take breaks if you‚Äôre upset about the rewards or just tired in general. Onto my review, I absolutely love Genshin impact. I don‚Äôt like the gacha aspect, I really only participate just for, like everyone does, the characters I love, but that‚Äôs not my main focus. I think the main things I love about Genshin is the co-op experiences, the story, the scenery, etc. For me, it‚Äôs like an escape. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the community has resorted to review bombing not only Mihoyo‚Äôs apps, but other apps that aren‚Äôt even associated with Mihoyo. They‚Äôre making the community look like fools. For me personally, I really could care less about the rewards as long as we‚Äôre getting something. So Happy Anniversary Genshin impact and I look forward to the years to come <3",5
"Genshin Impact is a wonderful but ultimately deeply flawed game. It will enthrall new players with exciting world to explore and story to follow. Up until they reach the end of the main quest to discover there really isn‚Äôt much to do. The content you can expect at that point is limited to about 20min of gameplay in the form of grinding and dailies. At which point you‚Äôre basically done. The developers are stuck in a mindset of overly focusing on short term events which add some new boss or piece of content temporarily. The problem being that it doesn‚Äôt actually net add more content, and poof it‚Äôs gone. Any other developer would keep the exiting boss fights and mini games to cumulatively add to the permanent end game of things to do. But not MiHoYo. It would appear in an attempt to pull players in with FOMO they are handicapping the experience for players. A new player today would have not experienced nearly half of the new content that had been released over the span of a year because all of that content was temporary. That‚Äôs why after a year the game continues to feel empty.",3
"I absolutely love and adore this game and the characters. I‚Äôve been playing since launch and have spent quite a bit of money on this game. It was fun to watch it grow and get the appreciation I thought it deserved at launch. 

However, after one year of ups and downs with the game. The anniversary for the game is finally here and do you know what the company decided to do to show their appreciation? They give out 10 intertwined fates (Not even close to a guaranteed 5 star) and use the communities creative talents to promote their game even more. It‚Äôs honestly just so sad and disgusting because we‚Äôve had other events that have felt more anniversary like than this one. Heck, even at launch they gave like 40 wishes!! And after a year of success, Mihoyo has turned greedy. I won‚Äôt be spending any more money on this game because Mihoyo needs to show appreciate for their player base and community.  Giving away a standard 5 star character or weapon would not have even put a dent in their profits, it‚Äôs ridiculous. 

On top of all the outrage from the player base about this hella underwhelming (understatement) anniversary, Mihoyo chooses to stay quiet amidst of it all and not even respond to their player base.",1
"The game is really fun. There‚Äôs lots of places to explore, a story behind every character, and you can play with your friends. But there are some things that bother me.
First, the game takes up a lot of storage if you play on mobile. Second, sometimes the game gets really laggy, but it‚Äôs not really a problem for me. Third, if you really want a specific character, you‚Äôre going to have to work hard, complete a lot of quests, and save up your primogems to even get a CHANCE to unlock a character. Fourth, even though this game is free to play and you don‚Äôt have to pay real money, it gets annoying when the only option you have left is to pay money for in-game currency to buy things. I‚Äôve never spent any money on this game, but I just wish there were easier ways to get wishes.
If you‚Äôre thinking of playing this game, I would recommend it. There‚Äôs some flaws, but this game can be challenging and fun at the same time.
Sorry for the long review, but have a good day!",4
The game is amazing the graphics the story is just amazing but they are issues. Once u reach ar 45 or higher the game does get boring and no longer fun but some might disagree. 2) the wishing system is a problem more likely the weapon banner. Adding the the path systems is extremely useless tbh like the system was fine before WHY CHANGE IT INTO SOME MORE EXPENSIVE like I know your trying make a profit an all but add this new system into the weapon banner is just you asking for more people to spend on it for your own greed. 3) going back to the weapon banner system u at the same time don‚Äôt even give good or enough rewards to make up for the your useless weapon system if u gave some actually good rewards then maybe  the weapon banner wouldn‚Äôt be useless and even if it still was useless you giving good rewards would make up for it. Sorry but I‚Äôm giving this a solid 3 if u want higher rates then remove your useless weapon system.,5

Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn‚Äôt lose to anyone.",5
"Genshin Impact is so successful and deserves that all, I play the game non-stop and can never put down my phone! I love it so much and the game is just amazing. The open world to go anywhere is amazing, with the sights and the realistic touches, along keeping its own design aswell is so smart. The fact the combat makes sense and is easy to do is AMAZING!! The game is so easily good and difficult, it‚Äôs not too easy but not too difficult. Knowing I can build a dream team is awesome too, but as saying that‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs way too difficult. I have tried for almost a year now to get the latest characters but they leave too fast, and are way to hard to get. No matter how much you sit and play the game, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs pushing you to keep playing or spend money.

Genshin has its flaws but it‚Äôs an awesome game, and the fact you need to work hard is the point, to strategize and be hardworking for what you want! It‚Äôs a 10/10 game and I definitely recommend you play it!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game, as of today, for six months now and I‚Äôve never gotten bored.  The story is interesting, the characters are wonderful‚Äîeverything about the game is absolutely stunning. I‚Äôm Adventure Rank 54, soon to be 55, and there‚Äôs still a lot to do, even though I‚Äôm an endgame player.  This game has kept me hooked for hours on end, with something different to do everyday.  Whether that be farming for artifacts, ascension materials, doing the spiral abyss, exploring, or doing quests, I never feel like there‚Äôs nothing to do.  Though the wish system is a little tedious at times, at least you have something to look forward to as you finish your commissions, explore, do quests, etc.  I now have level 90 Kazuha, Tartaglia, and Diluc, and I‚Äôm still building them, even though I‚Äôve maxed out their levels.  

Anyway, this game is wonderful and it has inspired so many people, including myself.  Keep up the great work, Mihoyo! :)",5
"I love playing Genshin; the characters are amazing, the gameplay is satisfying and the art looks beautiful. My problem comes with everything else; barely any quality of life changes since the games release, no new end game content added but plenty of other filler stuff (teapot aka housing, new RNG based rewards to bang your head against and new characters that you can‚Äôt even use if you‚Äôre new to the game) and stingy business practices with outside game events leave a bad taste in my mouth whenever I‚Äôm not playing the game. If I had a full team of the characters I wanted and I could use them in some fun content that shows what a good action rpg this game is I would give five stars easily but as it stands I‚Äôve been playing since the release casually and I have a few half built teams with bad rng artifacts. That means I struggle with content at my world level and am constantly grinding for materials to level up, not a very fun part of the game. If you love gambling you rewards and constantly grinding the same few fights every day download away but unless some things are fixed I will not change this review.",2
"literally played since day one done most almost all events, the game itself is decent at best after the honey moon phase. The game play loops get boring after a while with events just recycling the same ideas over and over again, daily login, mine, resin, and i forget the last one cause its all so boring, farm artifacts because you can never get the ones you want, and roll the stats for it, this whole game is a cash grab after you run out of story, and the only end game content is the abyss, which gets boring to do. Events feel like a chore after a while just to make the game feel new or relevant, but honestly the game just feels like its a giant chore and with story quests being tied to semi monthly updates and content it loses its magic every update fast after while. Then the anniversary just shows they dont care and want money from us with a 10 wish pull item and some scraps of resources. Its honestly laughable at how little they gave back to the community after a year of supporting them. Its been a grindy ride but honestly the game is boring to me and the company that runs it is greedy, even with buffing weak characters so whatever i‚Äôll look for a new game or something.",1
"By far the best game i have ever touched on mobile, as a matter a fact the best game anyone could play right now. The time put into the environment, the characters, the elements reacting with each other and acting as balance in Tevyat, and the gameplay which is the amazing cherry on top.

Despite being a gacha game, this game pushes all factors of pay to win progression into the trash as the free to play route is absolutely rewarding. Each character you are rewarded with performs in different ways which will help you complete missions, the story and even the treacherous endgame we‚Äôve all worked our way to, Spiral Abyss.

Veterans at games in which they are pitted against AI and hard bosses which require the use of the 7 elements, utilizing your surroundings and building teams that will conquer even the strongest of enemies, but it is not without a challenge. 

As a regular player, adventure rank 49, I have never put more hours into any video game as much as this game. The music and the feeling of being in the world of Teyvat is so immersive, and the weather blending in with the amazing soundtrack. I get lost and end up adventuring just to open chests and run around to find places to capture amazing photos and moments. This is a game which holds a place for everyone, and it‚Äôs a wonderful journey. And the best part is it‚Äôs just the beginning.

Thank you everyone at Mihoyo, for making this game, it really was the best thing 2020 has brought for me.",5
"So, when I got this game I was super exited! But when it comes to those scenes? Well it stays on a picture of it, it kinda makes the sounds.. some what but I can‚Äôt see anything, it‚Äôs like the game is going to crash but it isn‚Äôt.. I‚Äôm playing on my iPad, does that have to do anything with my problem?? And when i log on, I‚Äôm logged into my Game Center account but it says I have to go back to it, and when I don‚Äôt swipe the game up and restart, it crashes but that what I have to do to play it, what‚Äôs up with that?! I wanna play the game, not stare at nun all the time or whatever, but enough of me complaining, I just love all the details to this game, it is a remake of hanikai impact, (if that‚Äôs how you spell it) although I haven‚Äôt payed hanikai impact yet, or downloaded it.. so I‚Äôm not sure how good it is compared to this game, BUT I would recommend playing this game because it‚Äôs a super good game to play, only if your interested in fighting a lot and surviving, not too too much for survival but I still love it.

Have a great day, please consider what I said. Choa~",4
"I do really like this game. The art style combined with solid mechanics and an interesting story make it worth playing alone. That said, there are things that do need to be fixed. Early on they throw a lot of free stuff at you (as most f2p games do) and there is a decent amount of content to keep you occupied. The problems start once you hit adventure rank 20 or so. After awhile the game literally becomes pay to play. You have the energy to do a max of 6 missions (depending on the mission, could be as low as 2.) you are basically given a choice, save the daily gems you get to do a free 10 summon once a month, or use them to get more energy so you're able to upgrade and level up characters and gear. Despite this I do really enjoy the game and will continue to play, but if the current resin system doesn't change or they don't add other free ways to just play the game then I will be abandoning the game. Definitely worth checking out for now. Without a few changes in the future I would definitely say pass and spare your wallet.",4
"I usually hate games like these because they require skill to play, but this game requires no skill. The amount of serotonin I got from this is amazing. I especially love the amount of voice acting in this game along with the graphics. I also think it‚Äôs a very nice feature to have a time and weather cycle going even if you‚Äôre sitting idly by. You also get to cook foods and ingredients with items you have collected on the ground or have bought with the game currency which I think is a very nice side feature. I do have a question though, I noticed that we get to form bonds and friendships with the characters but does it go any farther than that? If so I think that‚Äôs really interesting. I‚Äôve been playing since yesterday and I‚Äôm already in love with this game, the plot, and the characters. If you‚Äôre reading this to decide if you want to play the game or not, I highly suggest it. It‚Äôs not a pay to win game, in fact I don‚Äôt think there are any in-app purchases though you‚Äôll have to check.",5
"This game is AMAZING. It takes place in a fantastic open world rich with lore, scenery, and people. The gameplay mechanics are easily learned and the player characters are all very unique. Quests are easy to understand, but difficult enough that some might take some actual planning to beat. The leveling system is simple and gets increasingly harder as you go on. There are  multiple different types of puzzles out in the world that give rewards when completed. Other features such as gliding and cooking will never not be fun to do. 
It‚Äôs truly an amazing game. 
However, it‚Äôs also prone to lag and random crashes. I‚Äôm nearly 100% sure it‚Äôs due to the massive amounts of data within the game that they let you download all of at the beginning of your journey. The crashes can take place at the worst times, but they miraculously always start you back off only a few steps from where you were. 
Other than the lag and crashing, I have nothing but positive experiences playing this game. 
This game IS worth the hype.

EDIT: after about a week of playing, the crashing has almost completely stopped, though once in a blue moon does it happen again. The lag also becomes less common, though not to the same rate as the crashing. Lag occurs mostly in battle, and while it can get annoying, it‚Äôs understandable with all of the fire, magic, and claymores being thrown around. 

Still an amazing game, just thought I‚Äôd add this.",5
"I really love this game a lot. I‚Äôve never played an open world game like this and I see what people mean when it is compared to BOTW. There are so many amazing qualities about this game that I could go on forever.
My issue and small complaint is something I believe quite a few others are noticing as well; the lack of mobile to ps4 cross save feature. I currently have the mobile version but the data this game takes up is horrendous! I have a ps4 that I could play on but I don‚Äôt want to start an entirely new game in order to switch platforms. Because Genshin Impact does have a feature to transfer saves from mobile to PC, I remain hopeful that the same is given to ps4 as well.
I don‚Äôt know whether creating a Mihoyo account would allow me to transfer my data; I can‚Äôt seem to find any answers regarding this anywhere.
Genshin Impact is an absolutely beautiful and astounding game but it would be much better enjoyed if it was possible to transfer mobile data to the ps4 for a better immersive experience.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing on and off since 2020 and every time i come back there are fun things to do but then i get bored again. Sometimes i wish that we could dress up the characters instead of having set outfits, i know that they are putting out different outfits but sometimes i wish we could mix and match. I love all the characters and the lore behind everything is really cool and ties together well, i think they should definitely add more diverse skin shades on characters from the regions that are supposed to have darker skin shades. I think the new regions are absolutely beautiful and can‚Äôt wait for the other ones the scenery from all of them are beautiful. I love genshin and again i‚Äôve been playing on and off since 2020 and if i‚Äôm playing again right now than that means that there are more fun things happening lol, but this game can be slow at times and you can get bored easily so play if you think you‚Äôll enjoy it.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing since may 5th 2021, I‚Äôm a few XP away from AR 58, I log in every single day and play for hours, I have multiple high AR accounts, I play on all servers. Very clearly I love this game but there is very little skin tone diversity. currently in game there are 3 non-paper white characters. Xinyan, Kaeya, and Bennett. These are the only characters in this whole entire game including NPCs that aren‚Äôt literal white.

The current available regions Mondstadt, liyue, and inazuma are based off Germany, China, and Japan, respectively. Germany I can kinda understand but China and Japan?! No way! China and Japan are very skin tone diverse countries, although skin lighting creams and skin lighting filters are very popular in these places it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that their people have a wide variety of skin shades, I have seen East Asian people darker than black people.

and in the new region Sumeru which is based on the SWANA regions which tend to have more dark skinned people, yet in the new trailer every single NPC is titanium white, as well as some of the characters from sumeru have been leaked and they‚Äôre lighter than any other characters. This is very disappointing. Hoyoverse, Please, please care about your fans. üôÅ",1
"I have been playing this game since June 2021 and it was extremely fun for a while. Until it started to show that the developers don‚Äôt really care about their players and only care about the money. It gets stressful and annoying and starts feeling more like a chore than anything else after you keep playing. It‚Äôs more fun if you have tons of money because that means you would be able to get the 5 star character you want. Because F2P players can spend months farming for primogems to get the character they won‚Äôt, only to lose the 50/50 and having to farm all over again and it just takes up a lot of time that most people don‚Äôt have. It would be really nice if the developers could make it more F2P friendly instead of having this as a game for whales and for people with money to just throw at it. And the anniversary gifts could be better. You make enough money from this game to give us a better thank you gift because without your community and players, this game wouldn‚Äôt of become as popular as it has. So please work on making it more fun for your F2P players. Thanks.",2
"Genshin is truly a unique gem of a game. The world and art style is absolutely gorgeous. The story, for the most part, is well written. The characters are amazing and they keep introducing new ones to fall in love with. The game gets constant updates to always give you something to do or something to look forward too. 

Now to address some concerns. The biggest thing people talk about is the gacha. Everyone wishes it was more generous but I don‚Äôt mind it. If you save you can get the character you want. I only buy the bp and monthly moon but even if you took away half my 5 stars I would still have a lot. 

The biggest problem I have with the game is the artifacts. I just wish there was some way to have a artifact pity system. My poor Klee still doesn‚Äôt have a good crown even after many, many tries. But overall this problem isn‚Äôt enough to lower it a star. This game is fantastic and I don‚Äôt see myself stopping anytime soon.",5
Sadly Genshin has a few limitations. I wish that it was more compatible with most devices but I‚Äôll take what I can get. I play on mobile due to the fact it‚Äôs not compatible with both my laptops. On mobile there are a few issues. Whether it kicks you out or just freezes. But still it is still impressive to be able to play on mobile. I think the plot and the idea of the game is good! I honestly really like the adventure aspect of the game. Getting to do and walk wherever you want is quite fun! Having the freedom to grant any of your wishes. The characters are cute! Just like any Gacha game! It‚Äôs sooo tempting to just spend primogems and money on every character. I think that in the beginning It wasn‚Äôt as intriguing but once you get past the ‚Äúfighting dvalin‚Äù it definitely starts setting in. I like how most of the quests seem to connect to the plot. The graphics are to DIE for. It‚Äôs a really great game! And I think I‚Äôm already obsessed.,5
"So i had genshin, and i was all about it. I played for HOURS at a time and yet i didn‚Äôt know it had co-op. Now a-lot of parents don‚Äôt like multiplayer games with people you most likely don‚Äôt know, thats fine, worrying about your child‚Äôs safety. The slight problem is that parents are most definitely going to delete the game if it had co-op installed in the genshin system. Which might default the company‚Äôs game content as a whole. 
A smart add is for a parental control,
Which would manage how much time you can play for and co-op settings which enable removal or only being able to chat with certain people. My mom deleted it for this reason. Altogether, many people cant play genshin because of co-op, and it would be nice if they added controls for parents such as these. Other than that, beautiful graphics and good characters, and controls aren‚Äôt confusing at all, just needs some child safety. 
9/10, would play again if i ever get the chance. Thank you devs for reading. (*'‚ñΩ'*)",4
"I‚Äôm pretty sure this game hates me because I can‚Äôt make it past 60% now, that door is a curse! I waited for the game to download but it took 2 days and way to much storage I deleted all my games just for a game that doesn‚Äôt let me past the loading screen, I was very exited to play at first but now I want to delete it. I actually wanted to play but once I reach 40% a door appears like it‚Äôs supposed to, but after you see the door and the loading reaches 80% or 60% it logs me out. Unfair man, this game looked so fun too. Seeing all the 5 star reviews makes me sick, also people who rate it 1 star are like ‚ÄúGIVE ME MY SKIN!‚Äù So stupid, but this is serious they‚Äôre mad about not getting a skin I can‚Äôt even see the skins cause I can‚Äôt even get in the game. What a wonderful world we live in.  If you read this and you are thinking about downloading the game don‚Äôt do it on mobile if you don‚Äôt have a pc then try a laptop, don‚Äôt do mobile. You will lose apps and time and most of all if you make it in the game.. money. I want to play this game more than anything but I can‚Äôt, I wish I could too everyone that can is lucky even if you don‚Äôt get a skin, ur still playing aren‚Äôt you?!",1
"I love Genshin Impact a lot! But i‚Äôm having an issue with the quest ‚ÄúOutrider Style‚Äù you know how your supposed to glide across and a sudden wind current appears? Well theres a bug or problem with that. Everytime I glide across it just makes me fall slowly and no wind current appears my screen is just stuck in one position and I cant do anything but do the plunge attack on some of my characters the worst thing possible is that I have to do this quest to unlock co op which I cant do because of this bug, anyways in more information about the bug all i could say is theres like an invisble wall that is keeping me from going any further, I cant move my screen or anything it just lets me fall after Paimons dialogue. I tried doing the domain again but the same bug keeps happening over and over I tried with different characters but still, I see no wind current and it doesnt let me fly up. Can you please fix this? Because I might have to quit Genshin if I can‚Äôt do this quest to unlock co-op and yes co-op means a lot to me",4
"I really didn‚Äôt get the hype over this game when i first saw it, it looked liked every other game out there. But when i downloaded it i was impressed. The characters are well made, and the storyline is what makes this game interesting. I found no holes in the storyline, the characters are easy to play, fun to look at, and the powers are very satisfying to use. The graphics are really nice, and this game requires no money to be able to progress further, and to be a good player. The only flaw is the amount of gb it takes, and the lag. Also it can be frustrating when you are in the middle of a boss fight and it kicks you out, and when you join back you are at the start of the mission and your all your food that you used in the fight is gone. This game also requires a lot of grinding, and time, but I still can play for up to an hour and get good results. Would definitely recommend. (ps, don‚Äôt use lisa for climbing)",5
This game compared to mobile games is definitely a must have. It being a open world breath of the wild style game. Exploring and grinding quite fun. The story while so far nothing spectacular is fun. The only two things that brings this game down a little. Is the gatcha system and rates. While free I wish they did things like separate the weapons from the character banner. Do what epic seven and allow multiple rerolls. So you don‚Äôt have to make a new account. Plus that would stop people selling accounts. Another thing is for people that aren‚Äôt used to gatcha game or rusty. Give them some more tips like focusing on two dps rather than the whole team. Had to start over cause I had to much fun and spread my resources thin. Trying out all the new units. Still for a mobile game this is the best of its kind. It‚Äôs about as good breath of the wild a fun but flawed game in iteself. So yeah I recommend it...... though devs can you please stop giving me 5 star weapons and just give me a five star character instead. XD,5
"The tldr is. If you don‚Äôt own a switch and always wanted to play breath of the wild, go head and give this try. If you own a switch just play breath of wild. 
If u want to play this game because of a certain character, then good luck. After 60+ pulls I‚Äôve got 8 characters, 3 of them are different characters the other five where duplicate of same person, the other 52 things from the pulls are weapons. Why weapons/items don‚Äôt have their own banner is beyond me. And if u think ‚Äúwill I‚Äôll just reroll until I get the person I want‚Äù, it takes u 30-40 minutes to hit lvl 10. Which is when u get ur second x10 free roll, so with the odds on the banners you might be rerolling for days and u can‚Äôt skip cut scenes. Yes you can play this game with any character but if your like me and a certain characters combat is what caught your eye to begin with, don‚Äôt hold your breath when it comes to getting that person

After play for couple months and getting to world lvl 6, u got to love how something just straight up insta-kill ur toons. Doesn‚Äôt matter if u have 3-4 lvl 20 artifacts and lvl 80, something still just kill you in one hit regardless if ur full hp",2
"You cannot claim to be international yet be completely exclusive of races other than PALE WHITE. The only moderately tan characters we have are 4 stars xinyan and kaeya. A starter character and a character with a very flawed kit that is highly unpopular. We don‚Äôt just want a flimsy kind of tan side character you can throw in to please people. We want EFFORT put into these characters and DARK SKIN. This game attracts people based off of these characters and I‚Äôm sure many dark skin people and more would be highly intrigued and want to play if they could relate to a character or saw a positive representation of their culture! I‚Äôm also disappointed with the effort put into character gameplay and we should be able to know what to expect with each new patch. Let‚Äôs not forget the billions of dollars your company makes yet players have to save for 2 months just to get one character it would be nice to know early on. With your success your company needs to be fairly more generous with rewards, primos, end games content, etc. Do better! This game deserves to be improved.",3
"I have been a long time genshin player. I joined in the 1.4 patch, and let me tell you, it was a blast! Not only was the game beginner friendly, but there were so many things to do at the time! I caught up to the story around the 1.6 update, just in time for the Inazuma update. I loved inazuma, there was so much to do and I have completed and maxed out that entire region. However , the game has now started to change. It is no longer beginner friendly. The character designs are repetitive and unoriginal. As of today, character designs from the new region have came out and they are horrible. Zero representation for darker skin colors , or just any skin colors other than paper white. This company supports the sexualization of young children and makes promises they can‚Äôt keep. At this point in the game, it is taking far to long to get anything done. There are many flaws in the gameplay, many of which haven‚Äôt even been reconsidered to be changed or fixed. They give out surveys monthly yet only listen to the Chinese players. Overall, I‚Äôm considering quitting and not continuing unless the clean up their act. 1/10 , do not recommend!",1
"Genshin Impact went downhill after the Windblume festival. Company stopped interacting with its fanbase, released characters with really bad kits (some of which can only be improved with multiple constellations, forcing players to spend even more money on the gacha). And don‚Äôt even get me started on the anniversary rewards. 400 primos, a ten pull and a glider. Comes off as really ungrateful for a company who made 2.45 billion dollars in a year just from mobile players. The only other things we got were literal contests, the winners of which had a 10% chance to win 100 primogems. Mihoyo has no respect for its playerbase or fanartists, and calling company advertisement with minimal rewards an ‚Äúanniversary celebration‚Äù shows that. No wonder everyone‚Äôs moving to Cookie Run. For Honkai‚Äôs anniversary, mihoyo gave players a five-star equivalent for free. What happened? The company got so, so stingy when they released Genshin Impact. I love the game and it had so much potential, but with the lazy writing of the recent quests and everything i‚Äôve listen previously, my opinion of this game is getting lower than the company‚Äôs generosity. I and everyone else in the fanbase are extremely tired of this behavior from mihoyo.",1
"I LOVE the game so far! It really is like botw, which makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics, storyline, and everything about the world is beautiful. I‚Äôve spent a good few hrs so far without getting bored. I also like how this game isn‚Äôt pay to play. The spawn rates aren‚Äôt that good but I can live with it. You can still progress in the game with the default characters. The game itself is great, but I do have some suggestions that I think will make the game even better:

- The ability to go into every building. While the towns are beautiful and big, I think it would be great being able to walk into houses and every business.
- Have more ways of healing. Cooking is great but maybe add an inn at each town? And also, have characters revive over time after getting defeated in battle? Or you can even add a feature where characters heal little by little whenever they sit.
- Have the npc conversations go back to where you left off prior to you selecting your reply. It‚Äôs kind of annoying having to go through all the dialogue in order to read the answer to every choice.

Like I said, the game is fun. The only real con I have is that the game overheats my phone and crashes at times. I usually have to play with my phone near a fan and plugged in to keep it cool and prevent the battery from draining. Other than that, you would not regret downloading the game!

Note: I play on an iphone 8 so I can‚Äôt speak for the experience on older models.",5
"This game was one of the few games that I played almost every day. I did commissions, I did quests, I pulled for characters and so on. Now I‚Äôm AR 56 and I‚Äôm taking a break from it. One of the reasons being, that my favorite part of the game, the pulling for characters has become so hard. I‚Äôm a very very very light spender and it takes so long to get even 160 primogems for one pull. I feel the commission rewards, quest rewards, especially archon quests since they take very long, and chest rewards should increase and the rarity for 5 stars should decrease just a tiny bit. Another reason why I‚Äôm taking a break is because of the storage. I‚Äôm only able to play on mobile as my desktop is very slow, and even on the lowest graphics, it‚Äôs extremely laggy. I understand though, it‚Äôs such a beautiful game with amazing graphics, it can‚Äôt be helped. It‚Äôs really, sincerely, a lovely game that I made a lot of memories with, and I hope one day I‚Äôll come back to it and get excited again <3",4
"Genshin Impact was a fun game. It was adventurous with characters and all this fun stuff to do- but no. Here are my reasons of why I don‚Äôt like Genshin Impact anymore: 1. It takes up so much storage. Once, I had deleted ALL of my apps just to play this game and it STILL didn‚Äôt work! Even my best friend had a whole different iPad just for this to work! I know this isn‚Äôt really a mobile game but why release it on mobile if it‚Äôs gonna take up so much storage? 2. Maybe this was just me, but my quality was bad. When I played on my phone and iPad it was kinda blurry. My iPad is old, but my phone is one of the newest ones so why would it be blurry? 3. It‚Äôs racist. Notice how there are little to no black characters? The only mixed character is pretty much white washed as well. Yeah, I haven‚Äôt heard much good things about the creators of the game. 4. The creators of this game are pedophiles. I don‚Äôt have much research of that either, my best friend just told me about it a while ago but I can remember that it was a good reasoning of why you guys are pedophiles. That‚Äôs pretty much it, it‚Äôs a good gameplay, but there is just so many cons about this game and it can be glitchy sometimes. Byee!",1
"Hi, I‚Äôve been playin Genshin for a few months now! I really enjoy all the adventures, quest, characters, and more! I wanting to share an idea Ive been thinking about for sometime. I know the the 2.7 update just came out but I was hoping this it could be part of the 2.8 update(if not able to it can be part of the 2.9 update if satisfied enough). So do you know when you do your burst to attack but some characters have an animation to it? Yeah, so I was thinking when your in Co-Op mode and battling with friends and about to do your bursts, there can be a certain button on different devices that allow you to connect/ make a combo with their burst. Pretty much a screen/animation that shows you and your friend doing a burst together and dealing lots of DMG. Well this is the end, I hope you understood this and took time to thinking about this idea! Please let me know if you have any feedback! Enjoy your rest of the day/night!",5
"I started Genshin Impact not to long ago, and I cannot get enough of it. The aura around it, the feeling of pride when accomplishing something- it‚Äôs a rare trait for games to have. Genshin brought me back to games. The characters play a big role in it too. The characters feel real, they have personality‚Äôs, they‚Äôre fun. The quality of the game is amazing, the way it feels real and the cut scenes are so beautiful. It‚Äôs got be so addicted, I stayed up from 3 am to now, not leaving the app ONCE. 
I personally love Venti, he is my favorite character and I‚Äôm even getting a cosplay of him! miHoYo, if you‚Äôre reading this, please bring the Venti banner back. I was very bummed when I saw that you couldn‚Äôt get him any other way. But still, he ranks top tier of my fiction crushes :).

If you want to download Genshin but aren‚Äôt sure about it, definitely do it. I cannot even describe the tips of this game‚Äôs addictiveness in a paragraph, but know it is the best game I‚Äôve ever played.",5
"Mihoyo seems to be making a lot of money but doesn‚Äôt like to reward their players for that donation. I have seen the charts on how much Mihoyo makes from banners and it‚Äôs amazing to think that people pay that much for characters but you would think that Mihoyo would show gratitude to the players by adding new ways to gain the currency to get said characters for free at times. In the game it may seems like their are a lot of ways to get that currency but there will come a time that players just plateau and will have nothing to do in game other than dailies and weeklies if you need them then log off for a repeat the following day. Chests are not infinite and once all quests have been completed you are left with nothing much to do. Events are a way for Mihoyo to show gratitude for the players but are lackluster once played. Events can get you some currency but the amount is lackluster if you think about how much is needed to obtain a character, plus on how much you have to wish to obtain the character you want with a 0.67% drop rate. In the end i say that Mihoyo should take better care for players as they are the reason why they still exist. They must be fair!",1
"If you‚Äôve played games like Breath of the Wild, maybe some of the ‚ÄúTales Of‚Äù series, this game is so good. The graphics are absolutely phenomenal. The sights to see are so beautiful, it‚Äôs so detailed and pleasing. From the graphics to the gameplay, this game is flawless. They‚Äôre constantly coming out with new characters and weapons, making adjustments so the game runs to its full capacity, and making sure the players are satisfied. You earn rewards for being adventurous and making mistakes. The developers also give you many free items in your in-game mailbox which helps a ton. There‚Äôs always new events and ways to earn primogems and mora (in game currencies) to help you out! Despite some easy glitches, such as chests sometimes not opening in co-op mode, or your friends swimming in the ground (it‚Äôs hilarious), this game is everything I‚Äôve wanted in a mobile game. It‚Äôs hard to believe that this is free to play. Start your own adventure and play with your friends!",5
"Gameplay:
From the few minutes I played this game I could see it had tons of potential. The gameplay felt good, the world seemed interesting, and overall made me think of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which is a good thing. The fact that it is a mobile game is impressive as well; it being free to try is probably the biggest reason to check it out and adds for it are not even overhyping it like other games have done with misinformation (RSL).
Performance:
The large scale environment combined with the console level gameplay is truly impressive with no graphical issues or gameplay bugs. With the ZBotW style gameplay, you can explore freely and see the nooks around the map and still with no glitches.
Visuals:
The performance could come down to the semi simplistic styles but that is also a catch of the game. It is colorful but controlled which makes everything distinct. I am a big fan of environments and atmosphere in video games and I hope to see a bit of variety. I enjoy darker tones and colors but I could still enjoy the lighting and colors.
Hopes:
I want to see this team tackle more types of generas with this similar gameplay and performance. I have seen a lot of fantasy games with the similar visual style and this one has done the best from a glance. However even though they have done it the best doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt spread there wings and possibly save mobile gaming from the repetitive fantasy worlds.",5
"Genshin is fine. Aesthetic wise, it‚Äôs above almost every mobile game I‚Äôve played, and the first few hours are a blast. However, because it‚Äôs trying to be both a gatcha game and an open world game similar to others, it fails at both. It‚Äôs not good at being open world due to having to grind repeatedly, making the world feel less and less interesting by the day. And it‚Äôs not a good gatcha game by making it not worth paying under hundreds of dollars. But the biggest problem with genshin impact is how it punishes you. If you play through the game fast, it punishes you by not having any end game content, and if you play the game slow, it punishes you by having the difficulty go above what you‚Äôre capable of, making everything even slower. To get the most out of the game, you have to play as efficiently as possible while keeping a very specific speed as to not fall into the boredom that comes with moving too fast or slow, and that‚Äôs no fun. This might improve in the future, but that would likely take a year at least.",3
"This tame overall is vey fun and addictive. The characters are easy to get attached to, and the cut scenes, animation, and storyline is very fun. If you enjoy fandoms this game is very good for that, just be careful of the weird people. And don‚Äôt feel like you have to be in certain part of the game. You don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a game, take as long as you want. And when you wish for a character and don‚Äôt get them, don‚Äôt worry. You can get them next time ofc. Genshin Impact has saved me from boredom and has also been my escape. I love making videos about it, and also my own stories or au‚Äôs (Alternative Universe). If you wanna play a game that really feels alive i recommend this. Also, I think an anime is coming out soon. I believe it‚Äôs going to be animated by Ufotable (?) The group who animated Demon Slayer !! So yeah, don‚Äôt let the negative that might be shown make you think this game is not good. It‚Äôs amazing. From characters, cutscenes, music, voice acting, nations, play style.",5
"This is easily my favorite mobile game of all time, thanks to the gorgeous graphics and extremely fun gameplay. The fighting mechanics are nearly flawless (with elemental reactions being a very big contributor to the fun). The story itself isn‚Äôt the game‚Äôs greatest strength, but it is still very fun to play through and see how everything unfolds. I am quite intrigued how everything will play out in the future; it is incredibly hard not to find spoilers all over the internet! It‚Äôs hard to believe that so much content can be found in a mobile game. My only complaint about the game is the whole ‚ÄúGacha mechanic‚Äù rewards system, which makes it incredibly difficult to get good rewards from your rolls without paying money. The pity system is a very welcome addition to this mechanic, but I think the rolls should be a bit more ‚Äúmerciful‚Äù. However, even though I am completely free to play, I was able to get a five star character eventually, and despite not having many, I still greatly enjoy the game! Keep up the good work, Mihoyo!",4
"I had got this game around the time of its release, and I thought it was fun. I played through the two available areas, completed some side quests, but I never increased in rank that much. Eventually, I realized the gatcha rate was pretty awful. 5 stars are extremely difficult to pull, you barely get any free currency, and you need multiple copies of a character to reach full power. Eventually, I just stopped playing, thinking maybe I‚Äôd come back to it if things got better. Fast forward to now, and I check the reviews. Sure enough, it hasn‚Äôt improved. Gatcha still as terrible as ever, mechanics nobody wanted, and I‚Äôve even heard you need 20 GB of space for it. I‚Äôd say I have a relatively good storage plan, but this is almost a sixth of it by itself. That was enough for me to finally uninstall. I figured if they hadn‚Äôt fixed it yet, they aren‚Äôt planning to. I‚Äôve also heard rumors of issues of representation of people of color in the game, but I‚Äôve been away from the game‚Äôs community so I can‚Äôt say for sure what‚Äôs going on there. Either way, it hurts knowing the game could have been better, but the company‚Äôs lack of care just held it back.",1
"First of all, I want to mention the racism that this game includes. The Sumeru cast was leaked, and there is only ONE character that isn't white. (The region is based off of south asia?) And Dori is a whole stereotype? Like what's going on with that? Also, the lack of communication with the fanbase is astonishing. This company does NOT listen to the fanbase or take criticism unless their own money is at risk. Also, there is a severe lack of endgame content, there's nothing to do after AR 55, and events feel repetitive and boring. And lots of story quests don't contribute much to the lore, and center around boring npcs we don't care about. Also, the rate resin refills at is way too slow. And, artifacts are NEEDED to make your characters good, but it's total RNG, and it takes FOREVER to get good ones. Also, bosses aren't getting harder, they're just getting more HP stacked onto them, and Hoyoverse is so afraid of powercrep they don't come out with more powerful characters to easily take them down. Until this game starts improving, I would advise not playing it, or spending any money on it.",3
"The game is good in terms of play and being able to roam freely. There is a variety of things to do and characters to unlock. Plus, events and good lore. But, the rewards for such efforts are quite underwhelming and the anniversary‚Ä¶ yeah that is just 100 times worse. I mean, a total of 60 primos a day without any events doesn‚Äôt help someone get banner character back to back especially in a 6 week span. In addition, just giving people 30k mora after a survey isn‚Äôt much of anything especially for an AR55 ranked player like myself. Now, lemme get to the crappy part which is the anniversary web event rewards. 90% chance to win 100k mora and then there‚Äôs 1,000 people who only get 100 primos. That is just like giving people the middle finger after playing your own game. Plus, the developers don‚Äôt even own up to such mistake which is not a good business move on their end. Just letting it run rampant while sitting back and thinking it is not normal isn‚Äôt right. At least mend the mistakes or else it only gets worse as time progresses.",3
"Goodness I am in love with this game. I have tried to leave but so far no game I've tried feels quite right. I love how it feels to play the game and I have an emotional attachment to some of the characters, including NPCs. The only problem with Genshin Impact is the enormous amount of space that it takes, especially for a mobile game. I have never had this sort of problem with any other game and it gets more outrageous with each update. Another thing is that there isn't enough things to do in late game, and while i haven't yet tried this new permanent update gameplay thing, I feel like there probably never will be enough content for late game. Also, the updates seem to be getting even more boring as they come and I'm afraid that by the time that all 7 nations are out that it'll just be repeating what happens in the first few nations. These are my only few complaints about the game, and I totally recommend it to anyone who likes open-world gameplay.",4
"I have seen so many mobile MMOs that I was scared this would just be a carbon copy of the others gameplay wise. I was so pleasantly surprised. There is no button you can press to have the game play itself, there is nothing to automatically move your character from place to place. You are forced to run around this world and explore which I absolutely adore. Not only that but the graphics are stunning! I don‚Äôt even mind that I had to free up quite a bit of storage on my phone just to download this, it was worth it! I wouldn‚Äôt have even minded paying for this game. I genuinely never expected the quality to be as good as this. Yes Honkai Impact is fun, but this game is on the next level. 
ALSO WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ATTRACTIVE CHARACTERS IN THIS GAME LIKE WHAT?! I‚Äôm going to be really irritated when I look at one of my sketchbooks and it‚Äôs just filled with these characters and human versions of monsters bc I totally haven‚Äôt started drawing the monsters as humans already. 
Send help I‚Äôm obsessed.",5
Coming into this game I thought i was fake when I saw the trailer on the App Store but it blew my MIND when I started playing it first of all I‚Äôve never thought in a million years that a game like this open world battle game would exist this early I‚Äôm very HAPPY ‚ù§Ô∏è I think this is the very very closest game that comes anywhere near Breath of the wild I‚Äôd BOtw had a combat system like this one I would still be playing Botw when I found out of can change the graphics to even higher same with the FPS THE GAME RAN EVEN SMOOTHER!!! And more beautiful I kinda feel guilty playing this game for free I wouldn‚Äôt complain if you charged for this game but thank you so much for making this game free a lot of people including myself can‚Äôt get the money right now but I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs free thank you so much I‚Äôll complete this game it‚Äôs lot of fun I recommend going into settings and changing the FPS to 60 and the graphics even higher your experience will be 100% even more enjoyable thank you!!!!,5
"So, I was a little hesitant to get this game at first. I saw someone playing it, and it seemed kinda fun, but I didn‚Äôt actually get it until around a year later, when another person was playing it. I decided, since it was free, to give it a try. I started the game, and at first I was kind of confused, since some stuff was a little hard to understand without other people explaining it, (wishing, artifacts, enhancing weapons) but once I got the hang of it, I fell in love. This game has cured my boredom so many times, and I don‚Äôt usually do this, but I love it so much, that I have spent a good amount of money on it. It‚Äôs such a fun game, and if you are debating getting it, I would really recommend getting it. Genshin Impact is an amazing game, with amazing graphics, story, and everything about it. I even recommended it to several of my friends, and they love it just as much as me. 10/10 would recommend you get this game. <3",5
"This game is absolutely stunning; it‚Äôs a console game on your phone. Beautiful animation, amazing voiceovers, vast worlds, compelling characters, and more. That being said there are a few things that need to be addressed by the developers: ‚Ä¢ When using PlayStation controllers the UI still shows a,b,x,y instead of the PlayStation controls ‚Ä¢ Controllers don‚Äôt connect automatically like most games. Instead you have to switch from touchscreen to controller in the settings. ‚Ä¢ UI needs to be adjusted slightly to avoid pressing on the Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro. ‚Ä¢ Other than those small things, this game is amazing. The time that is spent on everything is incredible. There‚Äôs TONS of content and regular updates. Some people may complain they have to buy Primogems, but so what?? The game is free to play. I recommend spending at least $60 (the price of any normal game) in the app to support the developers and get more content. Stop being cheap and expecting games of this caliber for free (it already is).",4
"Presented as an open world game, it really is dynamic, and it doesn‚Äôt cling to one thing or one aspect, the game has a lot of aspects and a lot of things you can focus on, like? do you want to explore the map and collect items, or do you want to build characters to defeat bosses, ect,

thought the game has a couple of downsides to it, starting with several glitches in events, the really bad rng, greedy company, and the miserable fanbase.

Breaking it down, 
the game revolves a lot around rng/luck based iteams, characters, weapons, and more, this is something most people can progress and deal with, but in late game, things like this just become frustrating and makes the game repetitive and very non-entertaining‚Äî THOUGH because of events and ongoing story quest IT IS something you can cope with,

Also, I have used money on this game‚Äî explaining this in a central way, Mihoyo is a very greedy company when it comes to Genshin, rarely do we get awards worth while, and the game truly does cater to heavy spenders, through for a casual player, I can see how this isn‚Äôt even an issue. 

One thing that‚Äôs also very frustrating is the gacha system, though, thanks to more frequent reruns, it does make things slightly better.. 

anyhow, This game has really meant the world to me for the past year, I‚Äôve been through tough times and getting on genshin and finding something to distract myself with has truly caused for an amazing experience overall, I truly recommend it.",4
"This game is over really fun! I love exploring the new areas, but something I‚Äôve been seeing a lot recently is this game‚Äôs lack of darker skin tones. As a person with darker skin, I would love to see more representation. So far there are only 4-5 characters with tan/brownish skin colors and with the new update you would think there would be more characters with dark brownish skin tone. There aren‚Äôt. What really pisses me off about this is that the new characters are mainly passed of DARKED SKINNED PEOPLE and yet they are either whiter than paper or only have a slight tan. Also the fan art and official art aren‚Äôt any better. They both completely whitewash characters and I‚Äôm considering deleting the game because of this. Btw what is it with making the strong, powerful women in this game literal noodles. Beidou for example is captain of the crux and fought a whole monster, but I don‚Äôt see any muscle on her at all. If I want to see one of the women look muscular I have to go on social media and google *insert female character* with muscles which is ridiculous. Anyways that‚Äôs all I have to say enjoy your morning/day/evening/night",2
"attractive characters, great graphics, awesome storyline, amazing animations, professional voice acting, etc!! i could rant for hours about how awesome this game is, but i do have one complaint. i‚Äôm not exactly rich and so to get good characters and weapons, this is definitely a more pay to win game. i‚Äôll admit ive spent money on this game and i have a decent amount of 5 star characters but losing the 50/50 on a banner to a character you don‚Äôt want and then having no more primos is the worst feeling ever. ive rage quit this game several times because i‚Äôm so upset about not getting a character i wanted so it‚Äôs a lot harder to get good weapons and characters as a free to play player. id also like to make a comment on the storage this game takes up. i have only 64 gb on my phone and a majority of it is taken up by this game. i only have like 300 pictures due to the 17 GB THIS GAME TAKES UP!! is it worth it? ofc but i‚Äôd love if there was a way to reduce storage space haha. anyways download this game you‚Äôll love it.",4
Dear mihoyo your game genshin impact is really good and I love it so much the characters the lore the gameplay it is all amazing I always get so excited to play but I think we should change the wish system a little bit and other stuff you see We should maybe lower the pity system to 90 to 70 it seems like a good update both for players and can also Benefit you! And for your money and genesis crystals as someone who hardly spends money on the game I‚Äôm happy with what you offer welkin is such an amazing deal I really can‚Äôt believe how you gave that much primos and genesis for it but you see when people buy genisis crystals for 100 dollars they hardly get it so I think you should work with that 1= 3 pulls 5 bucks= 5 pulls 10=10 pulls 50=100 these seem like better ways it really is sad how travelers use 100 but can‚Äôt get 100 wishes :( but that‚Äôs all I really enjoy the game and can‚Äôt wait for 2.4 from - traveller,5
"actually, i really enjoyed playing Genshin for year till i reach 54 AR, because right here you start the thing that players called ‚Äúlate game‚Äù and this means that you have completed about 90% history quests and other sources of primogems and AR experience, so after 54 AR the only thing that you can do is daily commissions and exploring world but its very boring. another problem is resin and domains: you need farm a lot after you reach a high rank, but you always have about 200 resin per day include waiting time for some more. its only about 10 times getting artifacts and you have a little chance to get artifact that you actually need: usually you are getting trash artifacts with DEF in the main attribute. its would be cool if hoyoverse make system like in weapon banner to get what you want.
above all, the game is very interesting, but a little amount of resin and game content for late game is the reason why you can hate Genshin or forget about game after 54 AR.",4
"The world is pretty and the characters make some fun teams, but all the designs are very chaste and puritanical compared to MHY‚Äôs other efforts. It‚Äôs also somehow even greedier and stingier than HI3, a game that was renowned for both its combat and its stinginess towards players. Lack of rewards, bonuses, a pity system that is a couple steps backwards from HI3 including a worse UI, and the ever present requirement for dupes to unlock character traits lead to a very player unfriendly environment.

The biggest claim to fame here is support that extends to console (although even that is limited so much it‚Äôs almost not worth mentioning), but the hoops they had to jump through for that means that monthly logins are awkwardly through a website that has no direct connection to the game.

Overall what we have is a game that is superficially great but ultimately fails in every single aspect once you dig below the surface. If you absolutely need a gatcha game with an explorable 3D overworld then it‚Äôs worth playing because options are limited, but other games have better combat, better systems, and are friendlier to players.",2
"Okay so, I NEVER have enjoyed mobile gaming other than your casual mindless low budget games. Games that you play cause you‚Äôre bored and waiting around. Nothing that you really need to focus on. 
But THIS? This game is absolutely fantastic. It has an amazing story line. It‚Äôs fully fleshed out. Ease of access to play. I downloaded it about 2 hours ago and have been playing it since. I‚Äôm only now taking my first break from it to write this review and then I‚Äôm jumping right back into it. Its beautiful graphics and gameplay design, open world exploration features, and my interest in anime rpg‚Äôs, has sucked me in and I have no intentions of stopping until I need to go to work. This is absolutely amazing. Developers? If you see this? Please continue making games. Don‚Äôt ever stop. I would have paid good money for this if you asked me to. Thank you for being the first to make a mobile game I am willing to put my time into. Would have given this 100 stars if I could. WOWOW!! ü§©",5
"this game is a really immersive and enjoyable game to play, but the only reason why this didn‚Äôt get a 5 star review is because of a couple things. first, its the slightly not f2p friendly game system. i know that this game generally can be played perfectly well without purchasing anything, but its difficult, especially with the way you earn primogems. hoyolab has been generous on some occasions with primogems, but the way you earn them is a long process, and sometimes you don‚Äôt even gain a good amount after completing an excruciating quest. on to the next reason; the storage. this game takes up SO much storage on my phone. of course, if you play this game on PC then you might not have this struggle, but as a mobile player, this is difficult. although these problems bother me, id still recommend this game to anyone that wants to experience a really beautiful game with lovely characters + graphics.",5
"Awful customer service.  After I changed my card I got charged erroneously by two apps, one of them Genshin.  I disputed both with Apple obviously.  Hoyoverse accused me of attempting malicious fraud, threatened to ban my account if I didn‚Äôt spend real money to replace my negative balance after they deduced in-game currency as a punishment, and I‚Äôve yet to get a customer service response that shows they‚Äôve truly read my dispute.  They won‚Äôt even comment on whether or not I‚Äôm still at risk of being banned.  All we‚Äôve established so far is that the evidential charge they cite in my in-game message does not have a charge associated with it, but they‚Äôve yet to acknowledge that it‚Äôs only further evidence I did nothing wrong.  The erroneous charge was for something you cannot buy two of during the same patch - it is literally a pass only available one time because it unlocks rewards.  I couldn‚Äôt have purchased it if I tried.  I will not spend money on this game again, even if they replace my deduced in-game currency and reimburse me for what I was bullied into spending to save my account.  The company is not trustworthy for billing matters.",1
"Overall, Genshin is a very fun game! I‚Äôve appreciated the characters and story so far, just having fun and enjoying it for what it is. However, as Sumeru approaches, it has become very clear how Hoyoverse is going to treat this wonderfully diverse region. As a brown person myself who descends from one of the regions Sumeru is inspired by, seeing most of the characters being sheet pale is just‚Ä¶ sad, not to mention the clashing and stereotypical designs. I understand being uninformed, yet Hoyoverse has made clear effort in the past with Yun Jin, for example. Chinese Opera is a very rich and beautiful art, and they made sure to treat a character with this background respectfully and carefully. They did very well with her, creating and interesting and engaging character. The lack of care with this region is saddening and loses a lot of the depth that comes with it in exchange for cheap orientalist takes on the life and most importantly people in these places. 

Hoyoverse has the power to make this change and they should. The places that inspire Sumeru have incredibly rich histories, cultures, foods, and life. Leaving such behind will ultimately be a huge loss for the story they‚Äôve crafted.",1
"I don‚Äôt care who the kind of people are that work at hoyoverse and I don‚Äôt care of you are for some reason disgusted by what I and many others are saying. Even if you are racist and orientalist at least be realistic and acknowledge that there is more then one dark skinned person in each part of the world, ESPECIALLY IN A PLACE THAT IN REAL LIFE HAS MOSTLY DARK SKINNED PEOPLE. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you hate people because of their race which I don‚Äôt understand personally, your player base shockingly consists of POC and the fact that you are misrepresenting them has everyone angry, not just POC. I garuntee you will see a drop in your banner sales and player rate until this problem is fixed. I know I‚Äôm not spending money even if I can‚Äôt, if I had the chance to, I wouldn‚Äôt take it anyway though because it‚Äôs not okay wether you like it or not. You guys care about your money so much, so even if you don‚Äôt give a crap do what you do so your players can be satisfied and you can get all of your money again. This review will change only if your acts change. Sumeru better have a good storyline too to make up for this, and I want a better anniversary this year too.",1
"This game, is great. You can tell a lot of detail has been put into the world and the stories and the side quests. Which might just be my problem. I understand that the point of this story is to find our sibling but it feels like that whole point has only been brought up once or twice. We‚Äôre just hanging out with cool characters and maybe, just maybe one of them will actually help us out while we run around doing quests for them. I shouldn‚Äôt be taking things too seriously, that‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs been bugging me about this whole game. When are we getting to the point?

Ok on a more positive note, the attention to detail is great. I love the character‚Äôs personalities and backstories. There are different visions that are unique in their own ways and the fact that you can spend quality time with some of the characters is great. This game is great and definitely makes time go by",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for a while, due to school and stuff being stressful it‚Äôs great to relax and play a game. There are some things that could be changed seeing as though this company makes BILLIONS of dollars. Firstly, they could work on their servers more and try to resolve lag issues with co-op mode. Secondly, the resin system is absolute garbage. You need 20 resin for a single domain to get bad artifacts you can‚Äôt even use   , and you get one resin every 8 minutes so i could go take a shower and only have one resin back. Thirdly, it is very hard to get the main currency, primogems. This is not a problem if you are just playing for quests and use the  first free characters. This is only a problem for free to play players and light spenders, as we cannot get enough primogems to properly play in the gatcha. Lastly, the current anniversary awards are not very good. This company has BILLIONS of dollars and it would not hurt to give back to the community that made it happen. I‚Äôm not talking about 90 wishes or a five star. Maybe just a free Inazuma four star and like 40 limited wishes. But it cannot hurt them to actually care about the players that make them rich.",1
"I will say, there are some disadvantages to playing on mobile, but that‚Äôs always gonna happen, no matter the game. I love the graphics, the stories, all the quests that give you a deeper look into this fairy-tale like story, but then you realize it‚Äôs a lot more real life than we may like, from timmie‚Äôs father gone missing, sage‚Äôs childhood fantasies, and to Eury‚Äôs drunkard husband and Noelle not being healthy, in an attempt to make others happier.

Only thing I would recommend is an option in settings to more the buttons around, like for sprinting, attack, ult, burst, etc. so you can move them to a place you‚Äôre more comfortable with. This game is amazing though, absolutely love it and all the updates (actually, I also wish there would be a banner where you have a [smaller] chance of getting them, but all characters on it all the time, as opposed to the normal banners where, for example, Klee is gonna be undrawable in a few days)",5
"I play this game mostly on PC so it‚Äôs much harder by comparison to play on my phone, even with an external controller. The screen is too tiny and the device gets warm. BUT this app satisfies the itch and allows for checkins, shopping, and claiming rewards. The developers have done a fantastic job with almost constant updates and events. Gets a little boring after you complete all the events and quests, but it takes a long time to get there. The grind is real, but I don‚Äôt mind. That‚Äôs the game. You really don‚Äôt have to spend a dime to have a good time in Teyvat and you get all you need to get through the game for free. I spend a small amount of money to keep the devs fed and to keep content coming, and I get to pull a cool weapon or character in return every once in a while. Don‚Äôt listen to all the entitled people complaining about not getting enough rewards. People are responsible for their own spending habits and shouldn‚Äôt expect more than is ever promised out of a gacha game.",4
"I‚Äôm not hip to Genshin Impact, tbh I wanted to find a game to play that was close to a console and man this is it! I‚Äôm my opinion, the graphics are beautiful and it kinda has this Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wind style to it. The map is pretty huge for an iPhone/iPad game, I‚Äôm surprised it can also runs at 60 fps which makes the game even more beautiful (you have to set it in the menu to do it). Battle combat does get kinda repetitive, that‚Äôs my only nickpick. I haven‚Äôt got far into the game (Adventure level 10) but I wish there were more combos you can learn. If anyone played Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time, then you will understand where I‚Äôm getting at. You can spend points/coins/gems to learn new combos,
specials and etc. It‚Äôs not a big problem maybe the feature is unlocked later on in the game idk, but it will make the game a dozen times better, regardless this is still a great game and definitely will get my 5 stars!",5

I have been waiting for a very long time for this game to be released so I pre-ordered it downloaded came back to my iPad first generation to play only to get hit with a white screen it takes about 4 to 5 seconds before it shows up and then I‚Äôm hit with a complete black sky but the characters the buildings the ground everything is visible but you can‚Äôt see from a far everything is black is happening on other devices on the iOS not just The iPad Pro first generation which I am on please fix this issue the game runs perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy A20S! So it blows my mind that the game is glitching out on an iPad Pro first generation. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP!!!  Honkai 3rd impact works prefect on my iPad Pro 1st gen so idk what‚Äôs going on. I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game played around with the graphics on the lowest setting but it will not take that black background away and white loading screen. It‚Äôs funny because this game works perfectly fine even on high stands on my Samsung galaxy A20s,4
"Beautiful graphics, beautiful character designs beautiful sorry black but I have something wrong. Why is it so complicated? I know it‚Äôs supposed to be a very long story, but how does someone new like me? Understand some of these parts why does the map have to big it quite annoys me when I have to teleport to a waypoint, then go to my destination because the way point is far away when I walk or  climb Also, why do you have to put so many characters in the dump like Lisa is a perfect example she can‚Äôt mine also why do you have to make leveling up more complicated than it should be weapon in characters I have a level 20 but since these materials are so hard to find and am I why do I also have to be in adventure, rank to level up a character I don‚Äôt get just let me level up character‚Äôs in peace without being confused about where to get those items or have to literally be an ar rank i‚Äôm sorry if this is very long",4
"If your looking for a fun game to either pass time or invest your days into this is the game to do it with. The other review is someone who tried to launch it when the server wasn‚Äôt live yet. So that problem won‚Äôt happen for you. Back to the review. I‚Äôve played over a hundred hours during the beta and everything translates well to the base game as well. This game has full voice acting for most of the characters in the world going into this game don‚Äôt think of this as a BOTW clone. This game was heavily inspired by BOTW‚Äôs art style but that‚Äôs the only part taken. This game is built from the ground up and people can easily sink 200 hours into the game. A heads up is the company who makes this game is famous for making gatcha games. Everything in this game can be earned in game but it also can be bought with money. There is also co-op in the game. So if the gatcha style bums you out just know that the summon system is the only gatcha mechanic.

 I hope this review helps you out.",5
"This game is great in a lot of ways. The graphics are fantastic. The combat system is sophisticated and fun. The majority of story is inspiring and deep. The world is vast with many many scenery to explore. The events have varied gameplay and great stories too.

The only thing I find problematic is that new players are missing a lot of content and equipment from past events. There are no alternative ways to get them back other than watching videos from other players. Given the quality of these content it‚Äôs really a pity. There are limited stories, weapons, characters, areas, and more. The FOMO is super strong. As the game keeps growing, it would be less and less appealing to new players as the limited content they are gonna miss keeps growing too. Some of these limited content is only for more various play style. Others contain important lore and are crucial for cohesive storytellings. The later is even worse as it prevents new players from fully experience the story.",4
"Hello hoyoverse! I absolutely love this app, it‚Äôs amazing and has many options to do in this game. But there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd love to address, characters. You see there‚Äôs only 3 characters that are tanned/black etc. Kaeya, xinyan, and the upcoming character. Please for the sake of the diversity on our character designs, make some more tanned characters. I think it‚Äôd put the work out there for others to know about how we love to see others in a game and supporting them. Also another thing is plus sized characters. All characters we know are very fit and skinny. We‚Äôd love to see some characters that are a little bit more diverse then others. It‚Äôd be more open and a little more creative. Keep up the good work!! The characters just need a little work, and maybe also could add some animals? For example, in the water, add sharks so when you swim in the middle of the water it‚Äôs a easy way for the animals to get you. Just please add some diversity to our game, xoxo, genshin player. <3",4
"The graphics for this game are stunning, and I love that there is a storyline besides just mindless grinding. I also like that the gacha system seems fairly balanced, where it‚Äôs not to a point of being a p2w game. However, I feel as though gameplay can become slow at times, especially when you finish the main storyline quests. For example, after finishing the original stormterror quest (the one in the very beginning of the game), you need to reach adventure rank 18 or so. That‚Äôs fine and all, except there isn‚Äôt much to keep you occupied during this time period of ‚Äúin-between‚Äù (ranks lower than 18 but higher than 10) except for daily commissions and some side quests. Unless you want to do what I mentioned before (mindless grinding), there isn‚Äôt much story to keep you going. The commissions become repetitive and there isn‚Äôt much story behind the other side quests.

Still a fair 4/5 though. If you read through my entire ramble, thank you.",4
"When I first started playing the game I had a lot of fun exploring the open world, doing quests, and building characters. But Hoyoverse has very clearly displayed harmful stereotypes through its reveal of the Sumeru characters along with an antisemitic caricature Pulcinella. The three current regions each have their separate representation and inspiration from China, Japan, and Germany, while Sumeru will be a ‚Äúexotic‚Äù muster of a nation. Not to mention the colorism that‚Äôs shown through the lack of varying skin tones, only two playable characters being brown thus far ‚Äî with no dark skinned characters ‚Äî which Sumeru characters so far have barely added to that number. (The majority of characters of Sumeru characters to brown ones is incredibly high). It‚Äôs very clear the company and its employees have done no research nor care about the cultures and people their work is inspired by and it shows that in incredibly harmful ways. It clearly caters to a certain ‚Äî racist and ignorant ‚Äî audience. With the racist direction Genshin Impact is taking, I will not be playing if it‚Äôs not changed. I was looking forward to Sumeru but with each reveal of what will entail is greatly disappointing. Hoyoverse, do better.",1
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game and I always look forward to logging in and exploring Teyvat. The character design is so beautiful, the graphic design on the world is outstanding and overall this is such a fun game. 
I love saving primo gems and wishing for new characters. It‚Äôs always a good feeling to get and test out new characters. I personally have a couple favorite characters that include Thoma and Lisa. They are both calming characters and miHoYo did something right when they created this game.
I 10/10 recommended getting this game- it will change your life in ways you never would have thought of.
The characters back stories are so interesting to read. They also help get into the zone of getting to know these characters. I love how everyone has a different personality. It makes the game a lot more interesting. Sometimes I wonder how the day is going to go after logging in. ‚ÄúIs Kaeya going to flirt with me today?‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder w",5
"When I first started this game, it truly was the most fun I‚Äôd had in a long time. The devs truly seemed to love what they were doing, and they understood what their players meant to them. But now, sitting at this games one year anniversary, I and so many others feel incredibly hallow about this game. Mihoyo no longer has respect for the people who play this game and strictly prioritize financial gain. Even while spending so much on twitter hashtags, they couldn‚Äôt once think of saying they were thankful for where their players have gotten them. They ignored complaints they received from players about how they felt regarding the anniversary rewards, they continue to ignore bugs and fixing broken characters that desperately need fixed. They‚Äôve gone as far as to block anyone on certain websites that mention the anniversary rewards. Even typing this now I fear what could possibly happen to my Genshin account for saying the things I am. It‚Äôs become an even more toxic environment than it already was and I unfortunately don‚Äôt know where I stand with this game anymore. So please, don‚Äôt waste your time with a game that doesn‚Äôt care about you.",1
"Firstly I want to say i‚Äôve never been more addicted to a game before Genshin Impact. The game is absolutely breathtaking from graphics, to beautiful scenery, and how realistic the game actually is. I‚Äôve played genshin for over a little 2 months now and I‚Äôve loved every second of it. Just recently my account got randomly deleted. The game just logged me out one day and when i tried to log back in I was not able to retrieve my old account. It simply just started me all over from the beginning where the siblings are fighting the ‚Äúunknown god‚Äù I‚Äôm really sad about this because i was so determined to finish the game no matter what. If mihoyo cant retrieve my old account, I think i‚Äôm going to be done with genshin, just because it‚Äôs such a long story/process that i don‚Äôt want to do all over again. Other than randomly deleting my account this game is on another level and I recommend it to anyone!!",5
"I really wish I could rate this game higher than one star.  It has a ton of potential, and I looovvvee the idea of a wide open world with quests.  I play on an iPad, and the first problem I encountered was basic navigation.  There is a joystick control in the lower left corner of the screen, but it‚Äôs never mentioned in the help, and there‚Äôs not enough contrast that you can easily see it.  I only found it because I remembered another game with a similar control that I hadn‚Äôt been able to see either.  Once I got navigation sorted out, I advanced to Adventurer 4 and had fun doing that, but then I got to the part where I made it to Mondstadt and was given my glider and forced into a confrontation with Stormterror.  The audio is apparently corrupted because it keeps stuttering and the screen is completely black except for a few controls.  Every now and then, I see a red arrow, and I assume Stormterror is in that direction, but I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing.  Things like this really ruin the game for me.  I will probably uninstall and reinstall and try again, but I don‚Äôt hold out hope it will help much.  I‚Äôd like to be able to escape that quest, but I can‚Äôt.",1
"So I I got the game and decided to check it out since the ads on it were really good. I really want to enjoy the game, but the entire game is just like, ""no you don't get to enjoy this"". 

The intro backstory is very VERY laggy. Like I couldn't really enjoy it and no matter how many times I close out the game and reopen it to see if it'll stop the lag, it doesn't. 

The second part is the game. The entire world is literally a black void, not even joking with you. There's nothing but black void. I was heavily confused and tried accessing the game controls and couldn't find them to see if it'll fix the black screen that I'm seeing. 

Last part is that Everytime the character steps in water, (can't see the water mainly because the entire world is a black void but know it's water because it keeps saying wet) it give this bright blob of light, not letting me see the character at all and it won't go away for like half a minute. 

These are the only problems I'm experiencing at the moment so I would really really REALLY be grateful if there was a way you guys could fix this because the game looks absolutely amazing from the ads. Since it's very much new to the public, I highly understand why this is happening. Which is why I'm still giving 4stars since this is very much excusable. 

Overall, I'll be fully ready to give a 5star when these little malfunctions are fixed. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"I love this game the characters are adorable and everything is so detailed, from the grass to clouds in the sky it‚Äôs amazing and vibrant, I love that the map it so huge! If my friend hadn‚Äôt told me this was coming out I probably never would have played it but I am glad I did! This is the kind of game that you want to play for several hours and there is so much to explore, I wish you could actually team up with online players and have a more social aspect kinda like tales of wind and Iruna does that would make this game absolutely PERFECT! Maybe in the future I hope the devs will add that in instead of just for certain boss fights. I‚Äôve always been very specific with the types of games I like big maps, free roaming, joystick controls, good story and graphics and of course being able to team up with actual people I really hope the developers make note and possibly included it in a future update cause that would make it my all time favorite game!",5
"Genshin Impact is the game I play to escape reality. I think this is probably one of the best games ever made! I love the characters, the designs, and the graphics! However there are some things I really hate like Paimon‚Äôs voice. I really like Paimon and her personality but her voice is just WAY too annoying! At first you might think it‚Äôs cute but she talks ALOT so it gets super annoying. Something I also hate is some of the skin colors of the characters. I‚Äôm not trying to be racist or anything but I feel like the characters are a bit too white. Like when Nahida for example. Nahida is one of my favorite characters and I love her play style but I hate how she‚Äôs just so white. Also I feel like you guys are whitewashing characters. Let‚Äôs take Keaya for example, Kesha‚Äôs skin is dark in the game but when I was looking in the offical art I realized that Keaya‚Äôs skin looked much lighter and I didn‚Äôt really like that. Anyways that‚Äôs all I had to say I still recommend you download this game though!",4
"this game is a masterpiece of modern game engineering. any way you choose to play the game, there is something to entertain according to the taste of each player. this game is also a global conversation between players from all over the world, and the game mirrors the perspectives of our planet in the game; european/american, china/mainland asia, japan/korea, which also mirrors the cultures of the players in a fun way, and the co-op opportunities and social media presance of content creators is also a global conversation. probably one of the best action-rpgs i've ever played, a new sort of model, though! the game is free to play because the ""whales"" pay for the game and that allows folks to play for free and get an equal enjoyment of the game. a revolutionary sort of approach to gaming. also, being on mobile, counsole, and PC means that multiple platform communities are goong through the same content regardless of the method of gameplay. quite a fascinating game.",5
"Claiming that the fictional regions in these games are portrayal of actual countries, yet not properly depict them is not only concerning but ignorant. Yae Miko, as a shrine maiden, should have proper shrine clothing, Nilou and Dori are not a belly dancers and therefore do not need to show that in their models, and lastly being scared to add darker skin-tone/variety to the character models. Sumeru is based off of the SWANA regions and Natlan is based off Indigenous North America, yet you make the models shades lighter than Mondstadt‚Äôs NPC and characters, a German-portrayal region, and Sumeru‚Äôs archon #FFFFFF. You even make the enemies be shades darker than the playable characters, which makes me and many others believe that you view anyone with a darker tone (not the tan you slapped on Dehya, Cyno, and Candace/ Kandake) as antagonistic (ie Xinyan‚Äôs storyline and scenes from the GAA). It‚Äôs showing that you could not care for proper representation, design wise and even the pronunciation of some characters‚Äô cultural names, and care for some loose change. You were supposed to shine this region but now you are making us waiting for the umpteenth redemption for Natlan, which majority of your players have little to no expectations for already.",1
So yes the game is good and I downloaded the game a while ago but deleted the game because I lost interest in it and so I decided after 2 months of not playing the game from deleting it I went to the App Store and downloaded the game again and so after I downloaded the game it took a long time to download (and I do not think this had anything to do with my iPad tho because it is starting to get fixed and when I download other games it never takes very long to download) and so anyways then I finally went in the game to go play but I thought it was going to just make me play and no I had to make my account and wait at least 30 to almost an hour to load the data and the resources which was boring and so then I thought finally I can play the  game but no instead I had a loading screen of symbols and it does not load all the way and I cannot play the game and the game is still good but the issues are not letting me play again which is upsetting.,3
"I‚Äôm usually not even into anime-style games, but you guys have really done a fantastic job here. I have yet to find another mobile game with so much content, such amazing graphics, and the playability that this game has. Just one of these factors is hard to find in most games, but you have successfully incorporated all three (and then some). It‚Äôs really quite impressive. 

You can tell there was a lot of thought put into it‚Äîright down to the line of glitter that leads you to your destination while you‚Äôre inside the city of Monsdat (I would be lost without it!). The way it curves over the landscape is awesome. I don‚Äôt know much about graphic design, but I can imagine that it took much longer than we would expect to incorporate into the game.

You would think that a game like this would have bugs, or would be funny due to the fact that it is run on a mobile phone, but it runs so smoothly and I haven‚Äôt run into a single hiccup (other than sometimes the squirrels don‚Äôt move when you approach them, so killing them for meat is easier. Not complaining there lol). 

I have been playing for several months and have not gotten bored or run out of quests to complete. Like I said, I have yet to find another game that even compares in terms of quality‚Äîand trust me, I‚Äôve looked! Thank you to the developers üëèüèª you guys have created an amazing thing here.",5
"Right now when I start the game on my powerful iPad Pro all I get is a blank white screen for about 10 minutes, then music starts and I‚Äôm able to ‚Äúplay‚Äù. Upon initiating my game, the intro cutscene was 98% frozen and only offered about 3 seconds of actual footage until I got disconnected somehow from Ethernet (likely server side issues). 
	After about 6 forced restarts of a broken laggy cinematic that I cannot skip, I managed to reach a very smooth part where I could pick and name my character. After that it was a couple more seconds of broken cinematic which I somehow managed to get through on the first attempt. Then the real horror began... 
	My first open world experience was that of a 5 inch view distance and then black nothingness. All enemies were giant blobs of white light, and only some of the grounds textures would actually load in. The only part of the game that actually works smoothly and completely is the User Interface Game Menu such as talents etc etc.
	Character animation is very well done, but with all these other issues mounted up I‚Äôm gonna have to call this a game flop for IPad Pro users.  üëé I do not recommend this game for anyone using a Mobile Device.",1
"Overall, I am absolutely blown away with this game. As someone who has been around since Honkai‚Äôs earliest days, I knew I could expect great things from Mihoyo, but I didn‚Äôt think I could be more excited than I already was the day of the release. I remember being there for the countdown before everyone started screaming that the game was finally out! The mechanics, visuals, gameplay, movement-everything just feels absolutely amazing! There‚Äôs just one small problem I have. Occasionally, my game ends up crashing. I do play over my iPhone 8 and it tends to have a heating problem, so I‚Äôve balanced this out with lower graphics, but the game crashes frequently and I‚Äôm unable to prevent it anymore than I already have. I‚Äôve taken precautions to reduce battery usage and prevent over heating, but it will still occasionally crash! I‚Äôm in awe for this game, but I‚Äôd love for this problem to be looked at if possible for some of us who wish to play undisturbed.",5
"*F2P means Free to play* 
Genshin impact is an amazing game for anyone interested in open world RPGs. It has UNLIMITED things to do: world quests, side quests, boss fights, story quests, world exploration, etc etc. Though you have infinite things to do, you can spend a lot of time playing the game only to earn a measly amount of primogems (the currency used to gamble for characters). For example, by completing all four daily commissions, you obtain 40 primogems and a 20 primogem completion bonus. To put this into perspective, you need 160 primogems for a singular wish. Every ten wishes, you are guaranteed a 4‚≠êÔ∏è character OR weapon. After around 75 wishes, you are guaranteed a 5‚≠êÔ∏è character (or a weapon in some cases). Though the game isn‚Äôt solely about getting new characters and weapons, it‚Äôs nice to be able to obtain cool in game content without needing to pull out the credit card. Other than that, I think the game is phenomenal and I can‚Äôt wait for future updates and content.",4
"when my friend first introduced me to this game,I honestly thought that it wouldn‚Äôt be a great game and that I wouldn‚Äôt like it. oh boy was I wrong,I have grown addicted to this game, the storyline, characters,and the details put into this is absolutely stunning! each new update and quest leaves me amazed,these little events make it much more fun. im glad I was introduced to this game. also I‚Äôve got to say that the music is phenomenal! the amount of work and time put into the music is literally AMAZING! BRO ALSO I SAW CLIPS OF THE 2.7 UPDATE AND I THOUGHT XIAO WAS GONNA DIE- LITTLE SIDE NOTE!!!!!!! bro i have an amazing idea for the hydro archon! due to the fact that the hydro element is water (obviously) randomly came up with the idea of the hydro archon being a merman/mermaid/merperson? since ya know,water? I felt like that was an amazing idea! you obviously don‚Äôt hVe to but I just wanted to share this little idea I had<3
THE NEW SUMERU UPDATE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,FROM THE NEW CHARACTERS TO THE STORYLINE IT IS AWESOME! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòç",5
"‚ö†Ô∏èREAD BEFORE DOWNLOADING‚ö†Ô∏èlisten genshin is a great game awesome story lines nice bosses,breathtaking landscapes and very handsome and beautiful characters! But the thing is it take a lot of storage for most people idk for me it hasn‚Äôt happened yet but that‚Äôs depends what you play on . Another problem with genshin/hoyoverse (hoyoverse is the company that made genshin) is that the diversity. See the new region sumeru is based of south East Asia but here‚Äôs the thing most of the new playable characters are practically paper white the archon they worship is white enough to be a glowstick some country in south East Asia like The Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, And Thailand have mostly tan skinned people . Like me! I‚Äôm   Filipino and darker then all the new characters right now they have I think only 2 tan characters. The diversity is real huh.
But overall it‚Äôs a great game despite all the controversy it still remains a good game with its graphics, storyline, characters, And bosses!",5
The first time I played this game was a few weeks after if came out. I got introduced by my cousin and i have been playing ever since. I really like the game play and the wishing system. The lore is great and has such a good plot. But after sometime the events started to become boring and a lot of the game play too. It was the same thing over and over again with the game play and I wanted something new too. The events stared to become not as fun and to tiring. Plus the fact i started school too. So I stopped playing genshin for that whole school year and summer break. until i heard that kazuha was getting another re-run and a fun event came in play. Ever since that i have been playing more again. not as much but definitely more then the year before that. Overall I think that this game is amazing and definitely one of the more fun mobile games I‚Äôve played. üëçüèº:),5
"I started playing this because my ex partner did. Whenever I‚Äôm not playin Fate/GO I love to play this! The character designs are gorgeous and it‚Äôs a well thought out game. The only thing is that it takes up a lot of space. Ok so update- I wanna say the game is really well designed and creative HOWEVER I really hate that with all the updates this app takes up 18GB of data on my phone.. the updates also take a really long time, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because of my low storage because of the app. I continue to play since I have Mona,venti,Diluc ,Jean,xiao,Hu Tao, and Childe but it‚Äôs very unmotivating to have to wait 5 hours for an update to not even work because you don‚Äôt have enough storage. Also, after a couple teleports, the game crashes and takes forever to go back into. The pity system pretty much forces you to purchase overpriced primogems to get anyone, especially since high ar players don‚Äôt have many ways to farm. Unless you either purchase $250 of primogems or save for 7 months you‚Äôre probably not gonna get anyone.",3
"So when I first heard of this game, I was thrilled to try to play it. So I downloaded it, and I played the demo version. After a little while of playing the demo version, it told me if I wanted to continue playing, I had to get the full version. So I did‚Ä¶ at least, I attempted to. It was on that loading screen for a while, but that had been what I would have expected. So, I waited. And waited. After three days I checked the game to see if it had finished loading, only to be disappointed by the fact it didn‚Äôt load. It wasn‚Äôt even halfway loaded when I checked. So I had deleted it, which was a shame because it was interesting, and even better, a free mobile game with AMAZING graphics. I don‚Äôt know what happened with it, I even check my device‚Äôs compatibility with the game and it was in. So besides that one thing, it was pretty great to play, even if it was for a short while. I‚Äôm actually considering to try and play it again, to see if it will work.",4
"This is literally the best game ever made. It has a interesting storyline, and enough fighting that it‚Äôs not boring and not too hard either. I also really love the graphics and the music, it really is very calming. I also like how it is very user-friendly, for example there are tutorials and systems that allow you to get free characters so that you have protection. Plus, the characters have a lot of backstories, too, each with their own unique personality and amazing features. One of the things I like the most is that it‚Äôs free. I know a lot people like to spend a heap of money on games, thinking that it would help them, but seriously, this game is just as interesting and fair without money. The only thing that is kinda‚Ä¶ not good about this game is that it takes up A TON of storage. But of course, that‚Äôs fully expected with such spectacular gameplay, graphics, and storylines!",5
"Firstly, I genuinely do recommend this game. The beginning of the game is so much fun and there‚Äôs a bunch of content and stuff to do! You get a lot of  in game currency and you‚Äôre able to get a bunch of different characters for free! The graphics are stunning, it‚Äôs satisfying when you level up your characters, theres a bunch of different activities, and lots of events. However, the reason why I didn‚Äôt rate it five stars is because of the endgame. After playing for a while you exhaust the content and it gets really grindy and theres not much to do. Of course, there‚Äôs events and all that kind of stuff, however besides that there‚Äôs really only the spiral abyss.
My recommendation is to take the game slow, enjoy it in the beginning! If you don‚Äôt like the endless grind at the end you can always just come back to it later when there‚Äôs more content. So while I do recommend the game, just be aware there‚Äôs not much to do in the endgame. :)",4
"This game is amazing! I‚Äôve been playing for a while now and I love it! The characters, the storyline, the graphics! And I think it is the best game out there! Though I am free to play and it is hard to get the best 5 star characters‚Ä¶ BUT THIS GAME IS STILL THE BEST!!! And all those people who say that the creators only care about getting money and are stingy about giving us primos. Just think about how much time and effort they put into making the game. And just for you to say their bad about giving us primos!? How about you try to make a game as amazing and probably hard to make!? There is probably over TWO THOUSAND workers and their job is to make the game! They work so hard and their life‚Äôs work goes into that game! And now you guys are saying that their stingy about giving us free primos!? No other game gives you ABUNCH of free stuff for the game! So stop being stingy and think! They work hard on it and you need to cut them some slack!",5
"The game itself is absolutely fantastic. The characters, the storyline, the graphics, it‚Äôs all great. The main reason why I can‚Äôt give it a full five stars is both because of the community and miHoYo. All of the drama surrounding the first anniversary is being handled terribly on both sides. I can understand why people are upset, the first anniversary was a highly anticipated event and it fell short. The rewards were mediocre at best, and the web event only benefited a very small number of people. MiHoYo has also been censoring people by removing the signature feature in-game, and by removing posts and banning people in Discord and on HoYoLAB. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs right at all, but I also believe that the ridiculous backlash from the community was completely unwarranted. Particularly when it comes to the negative reviews that are being spammed both on Genshin, as well as on Honkai. Overall, it‚Äôs a mess of a situation but if you‚Äôre a new player who wants to get into the game then do it. I would highly recommend it, just avoid the community at the moment.",3
"The game‚Äôs graphics and music are beautiful and the world is fun to explore, but once you‚Äôre done exploring and doing the quests there isn‚Äôt much to do. Most end game content uses resin and you use a day‚Äôs worth of resin in like 15 minutes. 

The rewards the game gives you are negligible and embarrassing when compared to other gacha games. AR rewards are nothing considering how long it takes to get AR levels after 50. Getting primogems is difficult and is required to get characters in the game. The likelihood of getting characters is very low and the pitty system doesn‚Äôt even guarantee you the character/weapon you want. And there are no deals or bundles in the shop that help you get characters. This is very disappointing as players have the potential to enjoy the game so much more if their favorite characters were more accessible. 

The game is enjoyable and has potential to be far better. It is worth trying, but at the moment I would suggest new players not to buy anything in game as everything is overpriced and simple not worth what you pay for.",2
"This game is by far the BEST free world adventure role play game I ever played. The graphics is top notch, the gameplay is smooth, and to top it off, each character is amazing (Zhonglin is my fave). It‚Äôs also great that you have your own world for yourself and if you want to co-op, others can join your world without affecting it and vice versa). I love the voice acting for both English and Japanese (I prefer Japanese) but the one thing that stood out to me is that when you are doing the story, sometimes the characters would address me as ‚ÄúHe‚Äù even though I was the female twin. I didn‚Äôt get too bothered by it but it just stood out. Also, as a suggestion to the creators, it would be nice if there more outfits for each character and not only two outfits in the shop. I wish there was a huge variety of outfits or skins for the characters. Like October is coming up and it would be nice if each character can have their own Halloween costume",5
"It's have to be the best game I have ever played in my life! I got addicted to it so fast! I haven't found a glitch in the game yet and I've been playing for a very long while. I'd like if the banners stayed up a little longer for farming purposes. The game is very large but I know it can't be helped. The quality of the game and the graphics are amazing I have no complaints at all! The one problem is that effects me the most is that you can't climb on a wall that is faces more towards the ground, but that isn't a very large problem which proves my point that this is an amazing game! I will say that some people may find this game boring and not intense enough, but from a personal perspective I found many games boring and needing to be more action packed. When I found this games I knew I could take my time because theres nothing that makes you rush besides the banners. Once again, great and outstanding game Mihoyo!",5
"Genshin impact is a great game! The main story is very interesting, and the details and work that was put into the game is amazing. The acting is perfect, and the art and animation is breathtaking. The character designs and personality, not to mention the backstory given to each character is so cool. If there was a sixth star, I‚Äôd give it 6 stars, but there is only one problem. Maybe it‚Äôs just my fault for playing on a tablet with only 32GB, but it takes up half of my storage space, and it‚Äôs always a hassle whenever there is an update (Not to mention the frequent game crashing). To sum it up, I think this game is amazing, definitely my favorite game I‚Äôve ever played. The only thing that is wrong is that it takes up a lot of space for someone with an 32GB device, so if you have lots of storage on the device you‚Äôre playing on then you will enjoy every second of the gameplay.",5
"First i want to say that I have been playing this on Playstation 4 for about a year. I know that this review is for the phone version but i just want everyone to know that the Ps4 version is just‚Ä¶.the best game i have ever played. I‚Äôve played many RPG games and this one just beats all of them by a billion. The first time playing i was astonished by the beautiful world and the gorgeous characters. The storyline is so amazing and interesting, and the commissions help so much when you just wanna chill and play and don‚Äôt wanna focus so much on the story line. At first i was a bit worried i would remember the controls and understand all the buttons and things i have to do, but it was actually so simple!! After 10 minutes of playing i knew this was gonna be the game i would never stop playing. I get so connected to the characters and i just LOVE how everything works. 10/10 amazing game and would recommend to anyone!",5
"Fun game, i can honestly say i dropped more hours in it than i expected. Very dynamic play style and the first mobile mmo to feel like an actual mmo. A lot to do and a fantastic story. Now why my review is 2 stars. Reward scaling is ridiculous. You have a game mechanic called your adventure rank which governs in game difficulty and level caps. Every time you gain a rank you get a reward to help with the new difficulty. Except, the rewards are useless by the time you reach that adventure rank. They would have been useful maybe 20 ranks ago. You can only get meta characters and weapons through very low chance summons. With maybe 2-3 banners up for 6 weeks. It takes at least 50 summons for a guaranteed 5 star. Summon mats are not easy to get so youre grinding for a month just to get maybe 20 summons. Improvements‚Ä¶allow players to grind for characters and character constellation materials. More banners! Larger shop for in game currency and purchasable currency. Better weapon acquisition system for 5 stars. Logical reward scaling for AR40+ ‚Ä¶System to grind for cosmetics",2
"I starting playing Genshin Impact back in March 2021; I downloaded it in a mediocre hotel room over crappy wifi after having seen the millionth ad for it. I have not been disappointed. Although, some of the ads are quite questionable in nature and don't represent the game well enough, I assure that it's a great game. It's a very wide-open map with plenty of things to do and explore; (I've even tried to get my partner to download it so we could go on Genshin dates just because it's such a expansive world map.) The problem that comes with large maps and plentiful content though is the amount of storage it takes, but it hasn't been a major problem for me.... yet. I'm also grateful for the many platforms that can be used to play GI; I play on mobile, but I'd like to play on PC as soon as I can. There's so many options and opportunities in Genshin. I highly recommend downloading it!!! üò©üëç‚ù§Ô∏è - Owl",5
"First off let me say that I love this game. I have played gacha games for many years but have not found any as immersive as Genshin. The music, the scenery, story, gameplay and characters are amazing. I play just about every day. That being said, there are some things that could be added or improved.

1. Weekly boss battles don‚Äôt need to cost resin. They are only playable for rewards once a week and the resin they cost could be spent on other things such as artifact quests, wits, material and mora quests.

2. Resin either needs have a higher cap or a faster refill time. Both would be preferable as that would allow for more game time between updates.

3. I also think it would improve the game to have occasional quests that offer up free new four and five star characters/ unique weapons/ skins (like the quest for Barbara‚Äôs summer skin for example). Other games do this and still use the gacha system to release characters. This idea would help with the oft heard lament that game content gets finished too quickly. The interesting part of this idea is that it could be used to encourage exploration or could require players to visit multiple regions.

4. Certain characters in the game get a lot of negativity due to having not aged well as the game has progressed. These include Amber and Qiqi and would benefit from buffs to improve gameplay",5
"I‚Äôll admit ‚Äî I‚Äôve never been interested in the mmorpg-style of online games, and I had no problems initially disregarding Genshin Impact because of its mainstream hype during the year. But to my surprise (and slight chagrin), the game turned out to be incredibly engaging! I‚Äôve never been so invested within an open-world setting before and the fact that certain adventures and events are ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù throughout the months allow the environment to not feel stale or boring like most other rpg games. 

Honestly, I haven‚Äôt stopped playing it daily after downloading it only a few days ago, and after thoroughly enjoying it for a while, I couldn‚Äôt believe that a game with this much world building, fantastic art, game mechanics and story was listed as a free app! I could go on and on with how much I love this game, but just know that you will not be disappointed when exploring the world of Genshin Impact!",5
"I love genshin so much. The people, everything! Especially the gacha. I just need to say something, why is there only one blasian character? Xinyan isint even included in the story. I don‚Äôt thin‚Äô it‚Äôs fair especially since she‚Äôs the only blasian and mihoyo made the npcs think she looks wierd, scary etc. I think it‚Äôs really bad. If somebody makes a genshin charcter blasian to people say you‚Äôre ‚Äòblackwashing‚Äô. They just heard the word white-washing and made up ‚Äòblackwashing‚Äô. Besides that, the anniversary rewards. I feel like mihoyo is a greedy company and don‚Äôt care about the people who play it. First of- the anniversary rewards. What is going on‚Ä¶ 1 intertwine fate and 300 mora. 100 primo gems just to a few people out of millions. This is not fair. It‚Äôs not even a single one pull. Other gacha games have done way better. Like 10 pulls every day for the week, a 5* of their choice, 70 wishes, 100 wishes, etc. Mihoyo is one of the biggest gacha games with free play and RPG. Even the maintenance rewards are better. Some events are better than the anniversary rewards. So why mihoyo?",3
"I‚Äôve been playing since release and sure the game has come a long way from then compared to now and I thought they would eventually increase rewards and gifts esp for f2p players but seeing the anniversary rewards is just‚Ä¶ really? A lot of us spent money in release because we wanted to see how far the game could go and how great it would become and fell in love with the game and the only thing you can give us, the people that gave you the money, is 10 wishes? Seriously? A whole ten wishes for your first anniversary. That‚Äôs trash. Even the CN players are frustrated and the company won‚Äôt listen. I spend a fair amount of money every month on this game and even though I don‚Äôt mind the rewards because I‚Äôm p2p, I‚Äôm genuinely frustrated for those who don‚Äôt have the money to spend. Give back to the people that got you this far. I really hope that mihoyo ups the rewards and does something for the community cause eventually people will leave the game to seek out another that gives to the players (ex. Cookie run where they give a ten pull and over just for update compensation or minor errors that are fixed, do better mihoyo).",1
"I love the game and it‚Äôs functions. A small problem about it is the rates for 4 and 5 stars. Sure there‚Äôs a soft pity but as a f2p player primogems, which is the main currency for gaining  Intertwined or Unreconciled Fate for wishing and the only way of getting new characters besides the ones you get for free, but the character rates seem like they‚Äôre almost more common than others like in my main account I got more Noelle‚Äôs than I did getting Xiangling. I‚Äôm not hating about it but it‚Äôs a bit annoying to get some of the characters I already have than the ones I use on my team. Hopefully there‚Äôll be an update or some kind of event that helps with it. And I know that the rate up for certain characters are boosted in the featured banners but I don‚Äôt even get much of those featured characters than others like Razor or Ninguang. Either way great game and I hope there‚Äôll be a lot more content coming soon :D",5
"The fact that people are giving this game one star because of the skin colors of characters in game is frankly ridiculous. It seems snowflakes are getting offended on behalf of the Middle Eastern community, many of whom have expressed time and time again that they love how their culture has been shown and that they appreciate the new Sumeru region. 

This game is honestly beautiful and a joy to play. The graphics, music, and gameplay are all on a totally different level than most mobile games. I‚Äôve been playing since launch and just played through some of the Sumeru update with it‚Äôs whole new map and new story quests, and I am in total awe. I didn‚Äôt think the exploration could get any better but it did. The story quests have also improved in writing and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Exploring the world in this game is truly a magical experience.",5
"I love this game but I had to take a star off for everything that is bothersome in this game. 
1st is paimon. There needs to be an option to completely replace or mute paimon without muting the other characters. Paimon is not a guid nor is she a good companion. The way she is used to further the plot is annoying at best. If the traveler has a voice, then WHY do we need this flying piglet to speak for us? This is not how you do the ‚Äúsilent but deadly‚Äù troupe. There‚Äôs a long list of issues I have with paimon but I will leave it here.
2nd: the lore. This game loves to shove lore down your throat at every given turn. Lore being in some story quests are fine but I play the events to get primogems, not find out about razor‚Äôs parents. This could‚Äôve been explored in his story/hangout quest. Why they felt the need to add it just as a new map launched is beyond my understanding. There‚Äôs just way too much lore and too much forcing a connection with npcs. I don‚Äôt care about them, I want to find my sibling.

Oh and the drop rates for gacha are despicable.",3
"I have been playing since beta. I like to put time into a game before I write a review. I can honestly say I have fun with this game. I have played on all available platforms (PS4/PS5, PC, iPad, Mobile). This game is perfect when traveling or visiting family or friends out of town as you can take it with you wherever you go! The gameplay is great, You can always hop on and off as you please. I would say if you enjoy anime aesthetics and gameplay that resembles something like Zelda BOTW and the like then this game is worth your time. It is a FREE to play game so if you are on the fence, download it, try it. Literally nothing to loose, and you may gain a game you enjoy playing. If you ever feel like spending money on it you get characters/ weapons for doing so. If not you can still earn them by playing the game. Not sure what else to say. Go try it for yourself!

Thank you for your time.",5
"Hey! This is Pluto. 
Thank you for making such an amazing game. It‚Äôs honestly the best game Ive ever played in my entire like, life! There‚Äôs so much to explore! The music, the scenery, the story and characters. All of these elements is what makes a good game. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever quit Genshin, even if someone told me to. Sure, maybe the prizes and stuff aren‚Äôt too great, but that‚Äôs what makes a person so motivated to continue. At least, that‚Äôs how I feel when I play this game. The feelings and memories you can receive from Genshin Impact are remarkable. Exploring and battling with friends, choosing a companion to use for your entire journey‚Äî it‚Äôs the best thing someone could ever experience. Thank you, Mihoyo! I know there‚Äôs been a lot of hate with the awards and stuff.. but I don‚Äôt really feel that way about it. The anniversary is quite literally awesome! If you could, could you give me Kokomi? I play on the PlayStation and I‚Äôve been farming for her. Please send her to me, thank you.",4
"the game itself and the different play style and characters are amazing but you have to play it on a playstation or a super expensive gaming computer just to play with the game freezing or the potential for your device to mess up. I normally play it on my computer but it started sounding like a really loud fan and I didn‚Äôt want it to fry up because I use the computer for many other things. So I resorted to playing on my phone like I did when I first started, it‚Äôs okay, the graphics are bad it drains your battery, it has the potential to freeze for sometime and then you have get out of the app(it also did this with my computer on occasion) and most of all today when I was wishing my game froze so I waited for it to continue as usual but it would go back then when I tried to back out it still was on the same screen. Genshin almost made it to where I would have to get a new phone because it isn‚Äôt made for phones, it‚Äôs made for expensive gaming consoles and computers. I recommend the game for people who aren‚Äôt playing on a phone or a regular computer.",2
"I really enjoy Gentin impact and I think it‚Äôs a really fun game. The fact that there can be a free game as good as this with no ads is crazy to me. I love this game so much, however I have two issues. The first issue is that I wish there was a way to transfer my Apple account save too another account so that I can use it on my PC Secondly, I find myself finding way points, but not being able to activate them even though I am right next to them on the map, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre under me or what, but I find myself running around and not being able to find the way points, even though I‚Äôm right on top of them on the map, other than that this game is flawless. I love the graphics and I love that it‚Äôs essentially breath of the wild on your phone. The fact that this can even run on phones. Is insane to me. Five years ago I never would‚Äôve even. Fathomed this this game is awesome and I feel like everyone. experience it",4
"We have all been patient with the state of electro as an element for a long time because we expected it to get buffed with the coming of the electro archon. But with the coming of inazuma the electro archons home there was 0 change then we get a character who‚Äôs portrayed to be all powerful and super strong during the story for the character. But when we get them as a playable character they hit like a wet noodle.

Greedy mihoyo tried to alleviate this by putting two of their best constellations at c1 and c2 this is a shred they are an archon they should feel amazing out of the gate at c0 then feel cracked out once you start getting constellations.

In their current state the electro archon is worse than 3/4 of the 4 star characters which is horrible because they are not only a 5 star but A FREAKING ARCHON A LITERAL GOD AMONG HUMANS!  They can literally be replaced by a delusional girl with her make believe bird friend. (Fischl) who‚Äôs a 4 star who been out since launch. Why would I want to replace Baal who requires way more investment for little to no damage or battery gain when I can just use fischl and outperform her in every way with horrible artifacts.",1
"This app is a great app. The visuals are amazing and the story is the best. Three characters have very cool designs and you get a lot of freedom. There‚Äôs also lots of things to do so you don‚Äôt get bored! Such as hangout events, wishing, daily commissions, world quests, story quests, archon quests, and much more. This is a great game and I‚Äôve spent quite some time on it. Its truly addicting. But, there are two main problems that I‚Äôve had so far. First, let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm running toward a mountain or a hill. When I get closer while I‚Äôm running, it takes a while to load. Basically, its just a solid color and takes a while for it to get its actual texture. That is really annoying because as I said, the visuals are amazing and I would love to see them. Second is crashing. I crash so much and I gotta say it really gets on my nerves. Thats really all I can say, thanks for this great game and I also recommend getting Genshin Impact.",5
"I‚Äôm not the type who usually enjoys MMORPG‚Äôs, they‚Äôre incredibly grindy and boring for me. However, Genshin Impact is one of the games that has changed my view on MMO‚Äôs. Not only are the graphics and characters great, but the story keeps your interest. I can‚Äôt wait to see how far this game will come along!!

Couple suggestions though!!

Is it possible to have friends on other servers? I wasn‚Äôt able to locate one of them because he was in Europe, and I was in the American server. If not, definitely should be a thing! :)

Another thing that would be really neat is romancing characters in game! Going on dates and gifting them things.

Some other suggestions would be to make talking to friends more accessible, even if we‚Äôre not in co-op, it would be nice to talk to the ones online. 

I think the co-op mode definitely needs some tweaks, but it‚Äôs getting there. It‚Äôs not the greatest game for co-op, because there‚Äôs a lack of things your friends can do with you. We should be able to do more quests with them. It would also be nice to be able to have avatar emotes in game. 

Another thing I think could need updating, is the camera option. There‚Äôs a lack of poses and features for it, as a creative person, it would be nice to be able to take more photos of my game and with my friends! 

But all in all, you guys did a really good job with this game, though there‚Äôs still a few things that need to be tweaked.",5
"When I first downloaded this game, I first thought to myself whether this game is going to be as good as PS4 and PC, but after running through it, it surprised me. After playing the game for almost a week now, adventure rank 27, I can safely say this is one of my most favorite games i‚Äôve ever played. This game is so beautiful, and the fact that I have my graphics all the way low and it still manages to run smoothly is unbelievable. What I also love about the game is by the fact that you can get a guaranteed 4 Star if you summon on a multi. This way when you summon, you won‚Äôt get fully shafted by only getting 3 stars. Overall I rate this game 5 stars because it‚Äôs a lot of exploring, quest, cute girls to collect from the gacha system, cool combo‚Äôs, and an intriguing experience. The one small problem i‚Äôm having at the moment is crashes, where my game just freezes, but that‚Äôs just a bug and I expect them to fix it in the later future. Good Game!",5
"The game on pc is amazing, fun, graphics are nice gameplay is smooth and addicting  , the world looks very nice and there is a lot to explore and a fair micro transaction system, and most importantly it is not pay to win, devs are generous as well and give you quite a lot of premium currency for now, this seems unreal for a mobile game and it‚Äôs really a step in the right direction for a f2p game, my only complaint is that I cannot play the game almost at all on my iPhone 6s Plus, I have a black wall around me and it pretty much follows me, I cant really see more than 2 meters ahead, also I cannot open the settings menu either to try to lower graphics n stuff but this seems more like a glitch than a incompatibility with the device. I understand that the devs recommend iPhone 8 and above for it but I feel like it could be easily playable if I could get rid of that black wall, I would really appreciate if this will get fixed and I will give it a 5 star for sure.",4
"Honestly I just finished Yelan‚Äôs story quest and it was disappointing. I was expecting to know more behind Yelan‚Äôs character and her background, but instead we just got involved with her solving some kind of case, which I wouldn‚Äôt mind if we got to know more of her while doing it, but she was just bland and the quest wasn‚Äôt really about her which really disappointed me due to the fact that it was also long compared to other quests. And this is not the first time it happens. I remember Ayato‚Äôs story quest too. One of the most boring ones I‚Äôve done. It feels like I wasted my time expecting to get a good quality content out of the quests and it gets pretty annoying. I really put some of my time playing this game, but seeing these types of quest might make me want to quit. I put effort into getting a character that piqued my interest which makes me want to know more about them and see them in quests but it is truly disappointing to see their quests being boring and time consuming. I really hope hoyo gets better at making character story quests.",2
"I don‚Äôt really understand why this game is getting so much insensible hate. it has beautiful graphics and a very interesting storyline, beautiful character designs, etc. I can see that much time and effort was put into this game. And thank you for that mihoyo. I love all the games mihoyo created, honkai impact, tears of Themis, etc. 

  I love the aspect of farming very hard to get a five star character and feel very proud of myself when I get them, I know that you either also have the 50/50 or don‚Äôt get that five star character but that just presses you on to grind harder and it‚Äôs not like that character disappears forever after that banner, they get reruns so you can just easily farm and save more for them. 

  All the characters have a lot of effort put into their design, personality, and their weapons, my favorite characters overall are kazuha, Kokomi, Ei, yoimiya, shenhe, keqing, and a few more. I don‚Äôt see why people hate character and go as far as writing hateful comments about those characters or to the people who actually like those characters, I may dislike sucrose for her over shyness but I don‚Äôt go as far as writing or giving hate to people who like her. 

I‚Äôm very excited for the up coming updates to see what mihoyo ha sin store for the game, I‚Äôm very very excited for Fontaine with Lynette and lyney. 

Thank you so much for creating this game!",5
"The game is amazing and the graphics are just so mesmerizing. I play on mobile so my game glitches when I play Co-Op (multiplayer) but then again it really depends on the device you play on. My phone is a 7+ so it‚Äôs pretty old but the great thing about this game is that you don‚Äôt need to play in Co-Op to have fun! You never really run out of content and the game is constantly coming up with new ideas for events! The layout isn‚Äôt too complicated which I love and there‚Äôs always something for everyone! I love to go around doing quests and fighting monsters while my sister will run around and just enjoy the graphics. Recently, they came out with new outfits for characters which exciting because this is the first time they‚Äôve done this. Mind you, there‚Äôs also a great storyline which you can tell that they actually put work into it which adds to the experience. I highly recommend!",5
"sorry for any spelling errors üòã
but this game has been my addiction fir the past few months because like... look at it. it's beautiful to look at, it has a great character selection, it has good monsters and bosses to fight against, the story is great, and theres so much more about it that i love. it's so mesmerizing to get home after a long day and just get wrapped into this world where you get to fight monsters and talk to fun characters and not have to worry about things like school or work. it's really therapeutic to just look at how pretty teyvat is. everywhere you go there's beautiful sights and scenery around. the soundtrack is amazing too! it's so insane to think that this game is entirely free if you choose not to spend money and you get amazing gameplay, beautiful scenery, cool characters and soothing music when just exploring around the world and then more intense music when in battle. i will never get over the characters. i live for wishing and seeing the purple or yellow fly through the sky and get a cool character. the amount of joy i felt when i saw the yellow wish and got hu tao or venti is immeasurable. sure, it may sound a bit dumb because it's just a game, but this game is just.. fantastic and it's basically therapy for me and so many other players. i'm super excited for the new update! currently waiting for servers to be done with maintenance for 1.5 üò©",5
"In game I my vision extends out at about a 9ft radius with everything beyond being completely invisible and black, along with water being invisible at all times. There are also a couple glitches where my character flashes after stepping into or out of water. Monsters also seem to flash brightly when they come into view making them hard to fight (the light fluctuates but covers a third of my screen) if this turns out to be a personal problem with my device (an iPad Pro) then I will simply delete the game but I would hope this can be fixed. I have been anticipating this game for about three months since I discovered you from your other project  Honkai Impact. Considering that games performance, I know Genshin Impact will do just as well and if not better considering it‚Äôs multi-platform and cross platform co-op. Five stars since I know when I can play it, it‚Äôs going to be bomb.",5
Okay I have been playing for such a long time and I love it there‚Äôs events you can do quest explore fight monsters with friends and wish on new banners but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs for all mobile players but I can‚Äôt even play the game okay so I have been on the Asian sever for a long time and I switched to the American sever so I can play with my friends but ever single time I log in i can‚Äôt play the game and there‚Äôs a big event I don‚Äôt want to miss I love he game and I get play the very second I log in it kicks me out I can‚Äôt even get a glance of my character and I want to play until this game is done I also farmed a lot of primogems so I can wish but I can‚Äôt even click on wish before it kicks me out and it‚Äôs not my storage and it‚Äôs my favorite game and still my favorite game I just want to play again still you should download this game and rate high because this game is going to knock your socks off best game in this universe and in Teyvat,4
Genshin deserves 10 stars it‚Äôs the best game ever quality everything the characters which everyone loves the details the adventures the plots the reason why there is traveler is amazing only a genio is could‚Äôve of that this game could be in the top best games most played games most love games if you don‚Äôt play this game I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre alive this game is one of the purposes that I‚Äôm alive and I‚Äôm just a normal human in this world rating this game and no they aren‚Äôt paying I don‚Äôt even know I just love the characters especially the archons they are historical I love the people that the archons know the people that the people that the archons know I love every single part of this game remember your account cause if you lost it you loose everything in the world that‚Äôs the purpose of playing this game having the best out of the best fun  and if you don‚Äôt have fun you better start playing this awesome games Calle GENSHIN IMPACT!,5
It was a really good open world game at first lots of stuff to do characters were all unique it was different and fun but then there was a huge lack of skin tones within the characters and a stereotype on one of them game isn‚Äôt mobile friendly cause of how much storage it requires only after the thrid region even though we still have to wait about a few more years for the 5 more regions which will basically kill off all of the mobile players so maybe make it more accessible on other devices like Xbox and such so more people can play it and lastly you guys only listen to us when you game starts getting extremely bad reviews the fandom as been begging for more diversity and the devs refuse to listen to us just make the game more fun and accessible for everyone and stop being unfair to new players most of the new banner characters they have ti wait till the region unlocks for them so they can just level up the character let alone get their talents and builds done,3
"First off, this is NOT a slander, okay. I love Genshin Impact and its wonderful gameplay. BUT, there are some problems I‚Äôm facing right now. As everyone shall know, downloading Genshin Impact would take up ALL your space, and won‚Äôt let you play. The problem I‚Äôm having as of right now is that I would delete photos or even apps I don‚Äôt really need, and the game just won‚Äôt work. If I could show you a picture, I can. But, I think the owners of Genshin Impact can NOT make it so much space. Genshin is a GREAT game and I love it so much! Also, amazing plot and storyline (to me, you can disagree I don‚Äôt care)! But if only the game didn‚Äôt make up much space, I would be able to try it and maybe have fun! Well, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. Like I said, this is NOT a slander of this beautiful, and amazing game. I love Genshin Impact and everyone playing it. It‚Äôs very popular and I hope it continues throughout the years. Thank you for reading!",5
"When I first checked out this game in the App Store I thought it would be another one of those poorly made mobile games with the same concept as always. Genshin Impact does not fail to change that. Graphics/Gameplay wise don‚Äôt feel bad at all. The game can get immersive and keep you busy if you‚Äôre into rpg games. The character design as well as the environmental design is eye catching as well giving a ‚Äúlifting-mood‚Äù to me. 

The dialogue isn‚Äôt that interesting but the voice actors sure do make it like it doesn't matter what they say. They did a good job trying to pick voice actors for the characters.

In conclusion I definitely do recommend everyone to check out this game if they‚Äôre bored or tired of the same old poor designed mobile games. Genshin Impact so far has definitely changed my perspective of mobile gaming but there‚Äôs always some downside of it. Let that reassure you that it shouldn‚Äôt stop you from enjoying it. 4/5 (no ducks in the game)",4
"Its a fantastic game and i highly recommend buttt i will say i would recommend a pc or computer with a pc fan thing(i forgot what its called) or a phone with a lot of storage cuz trust me it takes loads of storage and your device will get really hot like any other high quality game now the reason why i give it 4.5 is because the warning is very annoying in my opinion and it keeps crashing my game ofc i understand the safety of people but can their bc a setting where you can turn it off? But if not thats still ok someone's safety is way more important. i would highly recommend to learn about pity, pyro, cryo, hydro, electro, anemo, and geo (i forgot the name of plant one but there is not a playable character for it) i would suggest you start as soon as you get a lot of storage pc, etc bc its a really nice experience ofc ur gonna get mad at sometimes but i love how theres always smt to do for mostly every level",5
I spent a hole 4 weeks saving up 40 wishes to get the 5 star hero and to me surprise 30 of those 40 wishes I only got weapons. It is says that it is guarantee to get at least a 4 star hero every ten wishes and I only got a hero one time out of 40 wishes and of course that one hero was a hero that I had already gotten so I saved up for so long just to get no new characters and a few weapons that I would end up either selling or using for weapon XP. Other than that I think that the game is very well coded and there is a lot of storyline to the game so you could play for endless hours and you would still have plenty more of the game to play so I highly recommend this game for anybody that wants an RPG game that will last and with a good storyline. I hope to get my money back because I also got annoyed at the fact that I didn‚Äôt get a new hero so I spent 5 dollars just to get no weapons for another 10 wishes.,5
"Let‚Äôs all agree that Genshin impact is a fun. Yet. Pretty fantastic game that can be played on ps4, ps5, mobile, and pc‚Ä¶ BUT‚Ä¶ There is one problem with the pity system in the game (read to understand) you simply have to wish (pull/spend some game currency for a character) about 75-80 times to hit soft/hard pity. Just to get a 5 start character/ weapon. Now‚Ä¶ I just wanna say that it‚Äôs not fair to the F2P players. (Free to play mean no money spenders on the game) that they have to work SO hard to get the character that they want. It literally take months for a F2P player to get 10 pulls on the banner. And once they have enough for a 5 star, they might lose the 50/50 which is annoying‚Ä¶ (losing the 50/50 means‚Ä¶ not getting a different 5 star character; a different one that‚Äôs not on the banner) Genshin impact is basically easy for the people that pay REAL MONEY. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love this game. But getting primogems (wish currency) is the HARDEST THING TO DO! üò≠",4
"This game blatantly lacks representation and is a horrible example for creative characters. the world building is great sure, but having the character be based off of REAL LIFE places such as Europe, china, japan, the middle east and so forth you'd expect some sort of rep, correct? there are a total of 4 dark skinned characters in this game who are all the same exact shade. Not to mention the lack of body types and physical attributes, you can‚Äôt argue that this is a ‚Äúanime game‚Äù because so many animes have brought forth creative designs and interesting concepts. Artist all over the place who make Ocs and redesigns do a better job than the actual staff who design and write the characters in this game. The characters designers must be very delusional to think nobody notices this or cares, they support horrible voice actors as well who have done racist and concerning things. Overall i wouldnt recommend this game as someone who is AR 56 and has been playing for YEARS i do not recommend this game unless you want to loose money, be associated with a pack of losers, and then be extremely bored when you finish all the in game content. Thats all <3",1
"Genshin. I first started playing couple months ago and at first it was really good. The graphics is amazing, voice acting is top tier, and the story line is great. The problem starts when you advance and become and decent player. It takes a long time to complete challenges and upgrading your character becomes really Grindy and boring. The wish system is bad in my opinion. It takes way to much primogems to get a five star character. The only reason I would grind was to get primogems but no matter how many countless hours of grinding and over thousands of primogems I haven‚Äôt gotten one five star character. It‚Äôs so rigged and the chances are way to low. Back to quest, some is unnecessarily long with barely primogems rewarded, the texts get extremely long and boring. A lot of the time I wanna punch Paimon because she‚Äôs the most annoying thing in the game. My advance to improve the game, add a lot more creatures and animals because it doesn‚Äôt feels Livy, make the grind and rewards much better, MAKE WUSHES COST LESS.",3
"I want to start off by saying how amazing a game genshin is- and i 100% recommend people to play it‚Ä¶ if they can. When i first started playing it was only around 5gb which was a lot- but manageable. I currently have an old model of iPad with only 32gb of storage. Now with the app at a total of over 14 gb, it makes it almost impossible to download, and, if i want to play it, i have to delete almost everything else on my iPad. Now don't get me wrong- i LOVE the game- i just really wish that the developers could find a way to make it take up less storage- although i understand that with how detailed the game is, that making it online would make it even more laggy. I also think that the wishing system is a bit flawed considering my friend got 2 5* by ar 10, and i‚Äôm sitting here with a pity tartaglia at ar 50- buuut thats probably just my luck :,). Anyways, its a great game overall!!! Thank you for making this, we love it! <3",4
"As i said loved it in the beginning. I‚Äôve been playing since launch of the game. AR 59 now. The game is beautiful when you start out and you have loads of content to play through. But once you reach AR 45 (ish) it becomes a repeat of dailies and waiting for next patch. The next patch is just a repeat of past events. One reason i still play this game still is because i have friends who can play this on other devices but even then it takes up so much space on their end. I wish the devs would make up their minds if they would want to keep this a mobile game bc the dont want to make end game content due to ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù yet they have these time limited events for weapons and v important lore. Like ‚Äúyeah you would‚Äôve known if you were playing in december ‚Äú üôÄ god forbid you take a month or so off the game. Now you don‚Äôt have enough to wish for the limited character and you missed the limited event. Don‚Äôt forget you didn‚Äôt get the event sword ‚úçüèª‚úçüèª‚úçüèª but adding end game content (other than dailies, using resin, or abyss) is anxiety inducing ok üëçüèº",2
"When I first got the game I was really excited but when I signed in I had to use a email that wasn‚Äôt mine and it‚Äôs kinda weird that it requires a email but besides that, I have a iPhone 7 and my friend owns a iPhone 11 and she can work it just fine so I didn‚Äôt really think about anything. When I got to the door I pressed start and then it asked for a updated version so I said yes because it said it was free but it told me to clean up storage so I did I deleted half my photos and almost all my apps because I just didn‚Äôt care but I went back in and it still wouldn‚Äôt let me in. I turned off my backups and deleted my remaining photos still nothing.. So I went on my iPad and downloaded it and clicked not to updated it and the game was absolutely AMAZING it had the best graphics I genuinely loved it! But I finished that version and it asked for a update and unfortunately I still couldn‚Äôt update. I hope you can fix it for iPhone 7+.",4
"When I first got Genshin impact, I thought I wouldn‚Äôt really like it ( I‚Äôm not big on rpgs). But when I fought my first fight, I knew I would love it. There‚Äôs so much to explore and so many different ways to play the game, I‚Äôm never bored. A really good thing is that you don‚Äôt necessarily have to pay to be good at the game, you just need skills. And the game never pressures you, so you have all the time in the world to get better at whatever it is you need. One small complaint from me, though, when you‚Äôre in a cutscene and you leave the game, when you rejoin you have to watch the cutscene all over again. But overall, even though the game might seem challenging at first, it gets easier as you learn different things from the helpful npc‚Äôs. One big thing that you can notice is the graphics. They are amazing! Sometimes better than pc graphics. 10/10 Amazing game, great for all ages.",5
"I‚Äôm sorry did I do something to offend the developers? Because I swear I‚Äôm cursed with artifacts. I‚Äôve played this game since day one, I have poured blood, sweat, tears, and dollar bills and what I received in return is a big laugh to the face. I love this game I really do but I‚Äôm starting to feel the burn out. Artifact after artifact after artifact and any good ones I get turn to straight garbage, every single time. Time from time I‚Äôve given you guys the benefit of the doubt and I understand it‚Äôs all rng but at this one point there is a developer that has locked all crit rolls in my artifact because I no longer get them and this all stated to happened after the team switch. So tell me what have I done? How have I offended you? Do I not give you enough money to atleast get a really artifact once a millennia? Tell me oh developers what I‚Äôve done so I can correct the wrong I‚Äôve made. Or at least change the rng settings for artifact to be a little more kinder?",4
"Very appreciative of how I notice the clock counting down to maintenance. And then once it happened, I found some work to do and came back just moments ago to find what was an estimated 5 hour update with 90 gems per hour and still got more gems than the time was worth.

I like how feedback is actually taken in as it‚Äôs a huge part of what sets this apart from other games like it. Is it perfect, no, most things aren‚Äôt. You‚Äôll definitely want to invest in a controller for your phone if you‚Äôre like me, however, the cross platform accessibility is a huge plus. 

The game is charming in visuals and for a mobile user (once again üòÇ) it‚Äôs on the top of the ‚Äòputty games‚Äô.

As a lover of the old LoZ, FF, and the old platformers, it is its own game. Not to say it doesn‚Äôt borrow mechanics heavily, as literally MOST games do! but it also makes it its own before presenting it to you in an optional play for play or play and pay to play.

In that regard, I was never forced down an ad, a reminder that could spend money, or any real roadblock in the main game.

However, I‚Äôm told the curve flattens out once the story is done and you are faced with a slower progression. I‚Äôm fortunate to play games slow in progression but quick and numerous with farming anyways so it‚Äôs a treat.

Give it a try, and at the cost of a download, install, and 10gbs of space you‚Äôll find out if it‚Äôs a good fit for you.",5
"hello I am very sad to give this one star review but it‚Äôs probably the only way I‚Äôm going to get noticed with my complaints so as the title of this rating suggests there‚Äôs an issue with the twins so when I got the game it was very early I would say in the development like the sky and the water hadn‚Äôt been even implemented in my version but neither did the models for the two twins when it said select the twin I ended up just picking one since I couldn‚Äôt tell which was which and I got the opposing gender which I thought would be fine it was a little annoying I thought I could deal with it but now it‚Äôs really starting to mess with me and I would like to find
Out if there is a way to switch them I know it‚Äôs very simple and cosmetic it just really would help the experience and help me enjoy the game more if I could get help elsewhere it would be very nice possibly an email to talk to someone with I have tried other methods but nothing seems to work and if I am able to get what I want to enjoy my experience with the game better I will give a five star review if not that is OK but I would like to know if there is a way to Fix this. Thank you for your time and again sorry",1
"As of writing this I have just finished the chapter 1 prologue missions on PS4, mobile, and PC. I‚Äôm a heavy mobile gamer that dabbles into the console from time to time. This game has great longevity and playability... there are elements of a lot of games in this one including BOTW but it‚Äôs also very different than those games in a lot of ways. There is a unique gameplay and style to this game that you can‚Äôt find anywhere else.... from playing through the opening fights and missions I‚Äôve found the load times and quality of graphics on the PC far surpass the PS4 and mobile... my computer isn‚Äôt the best gaming computer either (acer nitro 5) runs seamlessly and feels more fluid.... this is also my first ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù game I‚Äôve played that‚Äôs not solitaire or some match 3 game... I highly recommend this game for everyone.... now if they can get on board with the Apple TV and run the game through that platform... I feel like there would be great potential!",5
I have been a long time player of genshin and probably will still play for awhile more. With this recent dehya banner and my summons on it I have come to realize how terrible it all is. Not only did they release dehya as one of the worst characters ever released the rates of getting the character/weapon are so terrible I can‚Äôt continue to condone and spend money on this game. For frame of reference I spent a minimum of 354 summons on her banner and her weapon banner (about 120 on weapon and 230 on her banner) which if you look at in the store is equal to $900 of summons. Yet with all that I only got her once and her weapon once. That is not okay. The summon rates are too atrocious for me to support anymore especially if they are going to release a character that me and many others have been looking forward to for a long time now in such a horrible condition. The game is a good game overall but the horrible summoning rates and price of summons just kills any interest in supporting this game monetarily anymore. You can play the game but I would suggest never spending money on this since it will all just go to waste.,1
"So this game is actually AMAZING. You can explore and adventure throughout the entire game. There are just absolutely beautiful graphics and characters to discover. This game is basically perfect!‚Ä¶ except for the storage and updates. If you have an older device you might find that this game is capable of taking up half of your storage alone. But it you‚Äôve got plenty of room on your mobile device, you won‚Äôt have any trouble with this game. Now for the updates, I love them! The only problem is that every time genshin updates I have to wait for my phone to update the app ( with it open and on ) for up to an hour! I really love genshin impact i just wish it would be a little less of a hassle to play. But keeping in mind that it has such amazing gameplay it is understandable why it needs so much storage, especially since it‚Äôs mobile accessible.",5
"before i say anything controversial, i‚Äôve been playing genshin impact for about two years now. this game is beautifully designed, and i couldn‚Äôt recommend it more. though, there are a few things that i want to talk about. as i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen before, there is almost no content for endgame players. seriously. sure, it may take a while to get there, but for the people that have, it can be really dull. secondly, the wishing system. (this is how you get cool weapons and characters.) getting primogems as an endgame player is a pain. sure, you can go exploring but that only gets you about 1~5 gems every chest. the only way to get a ton is the spiral abyss, which has stupidly difficult mechanics. even if you somehow save a load of primogems, there is still a chance you may not get the characters you want. there are a ton of f2p players that are incredible at this game don‚Äôt get me wrong, but i honestly feel like the majority of players can agree that this is mainly a p2w (pay to win) game. i know that these developers need to get their money somehow, but baiting people into buying stuff is just wrong. there would be so many more genshin players if we were able to get characters easier. once again, don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a fun game, but i regret spending money. enjoy new players (: ad astra abyssosqe!!",5
"This is definitely the best game on the App Store, but honestly that‚Äôs a low bar to clear. Genshin impact is easily on my top 10 favorite games of all time! Genshin impact has a massive world brimming with life, characters that have depth and feel real, deep yet simple combat and story that had my jaw on the floor. Genshin impact is known for its gacha and for good reason, because it‚Äôs gacha is one the worst I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing, it‚Äôs less about getting lucky as it is getting 80 pulls and having a 50% chance to even get the character. For scale I‚Äôll give you the numbers, one pull is 160 primos, each day you have daily commissions that give 60 primos and events will typically give 50 primos per day. So each day you get 110 primos and each pull is 160 primos so you will spend well over a month gathering primos trying to get the character. Absolutely horrible.

If you have not downloaded this game then you are missing out.",4
"Hello genshin impact and the genshin fandom! I would really consider your help if your not busy currently. I apologise if im wasting your time, but i just wanted to say that i have been experiencing some issues which is my own fault due to my internet. But it has caused me a really big issue in here! I was just going to do some quests but my game map wasn‚Äôt loading very well. Which i didn‚Äôt really mind since it happens a lot. But this time it has kinda caused a issue! I got stuck while walking on some rocks. To the point i got inside them. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it but it‚Äôs been bugging me a lot. And i don‚Äôt know how to fix it sadly. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice or help me! I couldnt play this game for a few days cause of this. 

But on other notes. I really love your game! And it deserves all love and recognition. I cant wait for some new updates on this!!",5
"Ever since I started this game I was just glued to it. I got qiqi, my first 5 star in just 20 pulls and I was happy! The archon quests were so fun and exciting, PLUS the world quests were all so creative! I got so many primos and free wishes, and I saved for zhongli and got him, guaranteed. Overall, I was happy. My limited 5 stars collection was growing and I finally made it to the end of the current archon quests available! Then, everything went downhill. I had finished most of the world quests and archon quests and I was getting kind of bored, cause I had nothing to do now for primos and entertainment (besides my dailies, which only gives me 60 primos a day and spiral abyss which only happens every month) It was also hard to save for characters now because I‚Äôve basically explored everything and already claimed the primos. Now all i could do was 1. Do my dailies 2. Spend my resin and that was about it. I also went from getting 8k+ primos a month to 2.2k primos. Mihoyo please show some love to your endgame players :(",3
"5*->4* because of the rates. Makes me want to stop playing tbh. This game has such miserable rates. Don‚Äôt even get your hopes up for a certain banner or you‚Äôll be crushed. Saved 60 summons for a certain banner.. nothing. The only way you‚Äôll get it is if you have 180 summons saved (which takes forever) to be able to hit both the normal pity and then the banner pity. Absolutely disgusting when you can‚Äôt even level the constellations of these characters until the next banner hits (if you have wishes saved and skip on any other cool summons...) Good thing the art in this game and the exploration help to make up for the trash rates, hence my rating. The grinding is a drag but luckily it ends when you hit cap level & get the needed artifacts. However, this game could be so much better if it weren‚Äôt so stingy on wishes and drop rates. They‚Äôre hard enough to obtain as it is‚Ä¶ I get wanting the game to last, but there are other ways to do this.",4
"1) Loyal Genshin players have been asking for months for Genshin to increase resin count/lower resin time to make up for the increased amount of domains to farm. They have not listened or made adjustments.
2) Design team puts in research and effort in making characters properly represented by the cultures they are inspired from (Liyue = China, Inazuma = Japan) but does not give the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia the same treatment. Whereas other regions are representative of specific countries, the region of Sumeru is an orientalist mess, taking from various different cultures in countries that are separate from one another.
3) Design team is allergic to creating characters with melanin. Other games such as BOTW, Dislyte, etc. are able to create culturally researched characters with varied skin tones. 2 out of the 48 playable characters in Genshin, including the ones from Sumeru (a region with NPCS and enemy bandits with darker skin tones) have skin tones darker than a paper bag. 

As the game developers continue to show blatant disrespect to feedback from their fanbase, I am no longer supporting Hoyoverse as a whole including their future games.",1
"i will preface this with i love the gameplay. i play every day, am currently ar 54, and love exploring! BUT. there are some HUGE issues that are entirely unacceptable. despite being a mobile game maker, mihoyo makes this game impossible for mobile players. my game will crash ~every 15 mins or if i teleport more than like 5 times. this makes it difficult to do co op with others, because i will just freeze up and i either have to be kicked so they have a full team or they wait a few mins for my game to start back up (neither solution is that good). the updates also take up an outrageous amount of storage, and to update i have to delete pictures and apps to be able to play (i cant even imagine how it will be with all 7 nations). these issues have to be fixed because at some point these issues might grow so huge i have to stop playing (i know mihoyo doesn‚Äôt care, but if you are considering downloading this on a phone, please make sure you have tons of storage or can transfer to a computer if needed).",2
"Ok so to start this game is amazing, the graphics are really nice and gameplay and lore is creative and fun, the main problem that most players have is that the primogems and resin system is really bad. Once you get into higher adventure ranks it‚Äôll be even harder for people to get primogems for wishes which is really bad altogether for a gacha game and to top it off the resin system is also really bad when players want to buff up their characters. You get 1 resin every 8 minutes and it‚Äôs terrible for people who need anything from any kind of domain, please Mihoyo at least upgrade the primogems earnings and resin time. Free to play players won‚Äôt be able to enjoy this game without a difficulty spike and since they are free to play they won‚Äôt want to spend their time buffing up their characters, I beg of you Mihoyo please make this game gacha system easier, you will still get millions even if you add more ways to get primogems and resin.",4
"I‚Äôve played this game for the past year, albeit I took a couple months break. Everything about this game is amazing. From the lore and storyline to the voice acting, combat, and open world - it‚Äôs seemingly a AAA Action RPG title, that‚Äôs free to play. The only gripes I have is the lack of content in some patches, which some call them ‚Äúfiller‚Äù patches and how hard it is to get Primogems (premium currency in-game) as a free-to-play player. This is coming from someone who has a ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù account AND a free-to-play account. Aside from that, I‚Äôm grateful for a game that keeps me excited to play everyday and new content from patches to come. Genshin Impact is the only game I‚Äôve consistently played for the past year. Every other game I‚Äôve played, even if I logged hundreds of hours into it, gets stale. However, Genshin Impact doesn‚Äôt. Thank you Mihoyo and the Genshin Impact development team. I can‚Äôt wait to try Honkai Star Rail.",5
This has become my favorite game. I am disabled and it helps me pass the time I‚Äôm confined to my bed. I love finding treasure and oculus as well as solving puzzles. The combat isn‚Äôt my favorite part but it‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs a pretty well thought out system so that for people like me who aren‚Äôt crazy about grinding for artifacts or can‚Äôt afford the best weapons or units or constellations can still play all of the content and do reasonably well. Nothing in particular feels insurmountable even with basic units. I love that they added finding chests and oculus into the anniversary rewards though as a budget player I wish they had given out a free 5 star for the anniversary or done double artifact drops or given out 100 wishes like other gatcha games. I will continue telling others about the game and recommending it to my friends and family members but I will let them know the issues as well as the perks.,5
To start off this review please know that this is a gacha game. The content isn‚Äôt necessarily pay to win but it will definitely make it easier. Being a F2P player will definitely ask for a lot of grinding. With it being a free game the gameplay is more than enough. On the same level as mmorpg‚Äôs you would buy. The reason for my rating is the lack of end game content. Millions of players have been constantly playing since the release who are now in the end game. We are getting bored. It‚Äôs becoming a chore to play the game at this point. The lack of any decent anniversary rewards doesn‚Äôt make it better either. Expect nothing but stingy-ness from the company. They only want your money and don‚Äôt care what their consumers think. They also show favoritism to their Chinese consumers. Also currently now putting out censorship on all their forums resorting to any negativity towards the anniversary rewards. Mihoyo is a joke. I would still definitely recommend this game if you‚Äôre looking for a game to explore a new world and NEVER spend your money.,2
"I really, really love this game. It has kept me company during quarantine and (I play on my phone) has let me explore something absolutely stunning without the need to buy a console. The soundtrack is perfect and I find myself listening to the songs just to relax or to relive the moments of the story, a story which is actually pretty well written for a gacha game. I spent quite a bit on this gem of a game and I do not regret it. But gosh, what are the rewards for the anniversary? I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lot but this has just made me feel awful, it‚Äôs plainly underwhelming. I don‚Äôt understand why, what‚Äôs the need to reward your players with what‚Äôs very close to nothing? The rewards‚Äô page in game doesn‚Äôt even say that it‚Äôs the actual anniversary. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it is, in fact, since the game is pretty much empty as of now. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it, everyone is disappointed or outraged and I‚Äôm just incredibly sad. 
I don‚Äôt want 100 wishes or a 5 star selector, I just want to feel like I‚Äôm actually celebrating. Like a year actually went by and we reached this milestone together. I love this game but all of this is awful.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time, and I‚Äôve also contributed to the amount of income the game has received. Not only me, but others too, have given their love and devotion to the game. So you can imagine how we felt, when we were given rewards that weren‚Äôt up to par with our expectations. The rewards do not thank us for the dedication and love we‚Äôve shown so far. It almost feels like mihoyo does not care about the players they bring in, and the ones who are still here. Not only have we been disappointed yet again by the greed of this company, but we have also been given characters with terrible kits recently. These characters, the company still chooses to not fix. So far any attempts to give them constructive criticism have been in vain, because they have all been ignored. We want to be able to stick with this game, but it‚Äôs been getting a bit hard to stay. Especially when you have the company completely ignoring our concerns and inputs. Im not telling new people that they should play this game, but I‚Äôm saying that they should be prepared, because it might get worse from here.",1
The game when I first had download it it was working pretty well nothing was wrong everything was running and going smoothly and I have been playing for a while so when they said that we had to update it again I did and it wasn‚Äôt working so I tried to delete the game and reinstall it when it was done reinstalling I had opened up the game end it was working for a little bit then a few seconds later it started glitching like my screen was frozen and somethings will take forever to open up at first I didn‚Äôt think it was a big thing because it would only happen like a little but then I was playing and end it got me out of the game I didn‚Äôt know what had happened so I thought it was me and I accidentally get out the game but it wasn‚Äôt purposely got me out I come back in the game and it‚Äôs glitching more I could hear the attack sounds when I wasn‚Äôt making an attack end it was so lag this all happened today.,3
"I love Genshin so much, and spend so much time and effort into it. The graphics are amazing, and I‚Äôve bonded over this game with friends a lot. The only thing I feel like you need to go more in depth in is the storyline. It starts off amazing, but then near the start/end of the inazuma quests, it feels like just stuffed together to be able to create newer, hotter characters. And don‚Äôt get me started on how much storage it takes up..yikes. Less things to do as a higher AR player, and even though i am very exited with the new 3.0 update, the characters are disappointing. With barely any colored characters, it‚Äôs hard to to really be SO happy with the game. Not to mention the primogems system. With spending 100$, you can‚Äôt even get to hard pity. The community is also pretty bad, but I don‚Äôt feel like I should blame it on HOYOVERSE. But again, maybe I should. In anyway, HOYOVERSE is a very money hungry system. Don‚Äôt spend money on it, and enjoy the game.",4
"Update: Controller support has been added with update 1.3: I originally gave the game 3 stars, but have increased to 5. Thank you developers for listening! This is definitely my favorite game in recent years. 

I‚Äôve been playing this game since it came out and it‚Äôs been one of the best I have played in a long time. It‚Äôs just getting started and there‚Äôs already so much awesome content. However, I‚Äôm giving the game 3 stars because of no cross save with consoles and no controller support on mobile. If I would‚Äôve know cross save and mobile controller support would have been an issue, I would have started the game on my PS4 instead of my iPhone. I usually play about 3 hours a day, but I would play a lot longer if I could use a controller with my phone. Even better, allow cross save so I could continue on my console. Now that I have a PS5, I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on playing on a big screen.",5
"ive been playing this game for years now and little by little i get even more disappointed from it. its starting to get hard to play for me because i feel like they dont listen the players voices, like‚Ä¶ ever. that could go for a lot of things the company has done with genshin, but with that aside im talking about dehya here. multiple complaints have been made about the new character dehyas kit, shes a wonderful and pretty character,, but the audacity to make a VERY VERY troublesome kit then basically say ‚Äúwe think theres nothing wrong with it so were just gonna ignore you üòã‚Äù right to our faces is lowkey crazy. i waited for dehya since i first saw her and ive never been so disappointed. it feels like a waste to spend my everything on her if shes not actually worth anything, and the company just refuses to fix it.   and whats even worse is that theyre basically fixing everything BUT her kit‚Ä¶ like seriously üòê  some new bug with her kit has been constantly found over and over again, and despite the amount of issues we‚Äôve reported to them,, they just wont learn from it.",1
"I give this game a 5 star because this game makes me feel so much better and it‚Äôs so much fun whenever I‚Äôm bored or lonely and I have nothing better to do, my mom will always tell me to get off my phone Bc I play it way to often and I need to take a break, but y‚Äôknow what? I play all day under my blanket and don‚Äôt gone out unless bathroom, eat, or water. It is my favorite game in the universe. My favorite character in Hu Tao, sadly‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get her.. and I started to cry after she left but I still have another chance in the future, but still, SAD. Anyway I hope to play this game forward on in life because I put a lot of Effort and work in this game. 2020 was the first year I started, and I only had 3 characters, traveler, And the 2 starter pack people. Anyway I just really love This game but the only thing I need is extra time to get the character on the banner.. anyway that‚Äôs all! (2021 dec 14) ;)",5
"genshin has brought me a lot of comfort since i started playing back in february, and being able to wander around a different world than my own has brought me a lot of happiness. though i can understand why people have their gripes about certain things, and i do too, for me personally the good far outweighs the bad.

i adore the characters and story, you can clearly see a lot of thought and care put into each design, not just in the characters but in the environment as well. and the story itself just feels so big and grandiose to me, since we've barely scratched the surface of the tale being told. i'm very much looking forward to seeing how the plot plays out!

though, this game is not without issue. once you get pretty late in the game there's not a whole lot to do, you can wander around but past ~AR45 there's a good chance you've explored most of the area already. there are constant events which is great, but they're never permanent and there's only so much substance they provide. 

all in all, genshin impact is a great game, though it takes up a lot of space i'd say it's well worth it if you enjoy open world exploration and intricate storylines, and if you're willing to wait for new content to be added once you reach the end of the currently available archon quests.

and to mihoyo, keep up the great work!",5
Sooo this is an amazing game with amazing characters (Hu Tao) and music (whatever the liyue theme is called) and TERRIBLE gacha rates but it does make sense I won‚Äôt go into too much detail but you really can‚Äôt expect a game like this to have amazing drop rates in gachas in most gacha games I play (anime rhythm games lol) you just get a card that will not affect the game that much other than giving  some boosts that you can enjoy the game without but in genshin you literally control the character it (kind of) changes the gameplay (I think I went into detail) ANYWAYS time for the main issue that has been bothering me ever since I got the game so I keep getting this thing where the last part of the loadingscreen (geo thing)  won‚Äôt load when I open the game I just have to wait and it still doesn‚Äôt load it‚Äôs getting really annoying and im tired of it so please fix this mihoyo,5
"Okay, so if you‚Äôve heard this game from tik tok or twitter or another social media person and wonder if it‚Äôs a good game, you‚Äôve come to the right place. My opinion on this game is: I FREAKIN LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!! If you‚Äôre wondering why, it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much stuff to do, so many characters you can roll and simp for, and etc. I absolutely love this game, although, this game does take up a lot of storage, especially on mobile. If you love gacha games and wasting your beloved money from your wallet to get characters you‚Äôll absolutely die for, then yeah, you‚Äôve come to the right game. In seriousness though, this game has intrigued many people who love games that involve wishing for characters and weapons. Involving adventure, having story quests where you meet different people. It‚Äôs a beautiful game, with beautiful characters, beautiful music, and etc. It‚Äôs a really good game and you should try it out üòÅ!",5
"This game is so fun overall. I love games like this. The world is very large and fun to explore. The foods are very creative and I wonder how long it took to put precious time and effort into this wonderful game. I have a lot of characters and it‚Äôs a tad annoying to level them up, but that‚Äôs part of the game, so I shouldn‚Äôt complain. The details are amazing and I love every single one of the characters. Also, the lyre from the Windblume Festival is really nice to play. I‚Äôm able to play my friends songs and whatnot. I can‚Äôt forget the voice actors/actresses‚Äô outstanding jobs! I know they‚Äôve probably been working in that occupation for a while, so it‚Äôs probably no biggie, but I‚Äôm glad you guys chose these people to voice the characters! They‚Äôre so on point with the voice lines and dialogue, and it probably took a long time to make it so neat as it is now. Keep it up! Love the game üòÑüòÑüòÑ",5
"This game is honestly one of the best games on mobile, I‚Äôm not surprised it came from the creators of Honkai Impact. I don‚Äôt see it as a Breath of the Wild clone, it has its own uniqueness and even with similar functions when controlling the character I barely even think about the similarities. My only gripes with the game are the lag in certain places, especially when fighting against lots of monsters. The lag mostly happens whenever I use Klee. The voices and dialogue are great as well, but there are some places where the dialogue box either doesn‚Äôt match up with what the voice line of the character is saying or it‚Äôs incorrectly saying something. (For example, I am using the male character for the game, but Paimon refers to me as a ‚Äòshe‚Äô when talking about going into Stormterror‚Äôs Lair.) Overall not too bad of an issue, since this doesn‚Äôt happen all the time, but it would be wonderful if you guys could fix some of these bugs. Thanks!",5
"AR 40 here
No matter if you are a hardcore player or a casual you will eventually hit AR 30 and you will start to run out of meaningful things to do in Monstadt and Liyue then you‚Äôre left with a few options, scavenge the world hope there‚Äôs a respawned chest or one you‚Äôve missed, wait for daily commission and resin, or pay the absurd price for resin that also increases in price. Don‚Äôt forget about co-op, with only 180 resin a day you can do 9 domains with your friends! Even if it took 10 mins to do one domain thats 90 mins of gameplay that you would have to wait 2hrs and 40 mins to even do one domain. You can play the game casually but if you don‚Äôt hit AR 40 your world bosses won‚Äôt drop parts that are randomized that gate your characters talents. We ask for more food(resin) they give us a bigger bowl what a joke! They are trying to address everything else but avoid resin and won‚Äôt tell us why or when. Even if you love this game can you justify 0.6 rates? Don‚Äôt get haggled with their little changes and their so called ‚Äúevents‚Äù that barely give anything... They will empty your wallet anyway so why can‚Äôt we ask for more? Oh right we ran out of money need whale friends to help!",1
"The game has so many hours and hours of content all for free. I cannot thank Hoyoverse enough for letting us play this. Getting into the game first;of course; can feel slow to a lot of people. But oh my goodness when you give this game the attention it deserves it‚Äôs wonderful. Amazing scenery and soundtrack, lovable characters; a fun experience just waiting to be unpacked. And I love that I don‚Äôt need to spend money to have a good time. Genuinely Genshin is very generous when it comes to free rewards. A lot of the community makes jokes that it isn‚Äôt during it‚Äôs anniversary events but that‚Äôs not true. There‚Äôs plenty of ways to earn primos (the in game currency) and the gacha system is pretty fair! If your debating on whether to give this game a chance-please! Give it your time! Meeting the right people, bonding with characters; it‚Äôs all hours of my time I will never regretüíó",5
"Genshin is honestly peerless in its category. Imaginative, massively broad in scope, graphically beautiful, satisfying to optimize and learn. The greatest challenge facing Mihoyo at this point is endgame content, which can feel somewhat limited and repetitive after several months of dedicated play. However, that is not nearly enough to condemn it, and Genshin has been a daily part of my life for over 400 days now. I even decided to run a second account from scratch to relive the story and see what luck it would have with the gacha system. The fan base can be uncomfortably fanatic sometimes, but you can probably avoid the odd ones and find a good niche. My largest caveat is about the gambling experience of gacha, which some may not struggle with at all. If you are like me, this game can become a major outlet for creativity and stress relief. Would download again if I went back in time.",5
"This game is open world yes, but they lack endgame extremely. If you‚Äôre looking for a game with good endgame then pass along as this game only offers 4 floors called the abyss. It is four floors and refreshes only once every two weeks. That it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the only endgame they have. Also, they don‚Äôt have guilds, pvp, or actually dungeons. Only these things called domains which take about 3 minutes each to play. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this game until they add the things listed above that they‚Äôre missing. If a game doesn‚Äôt have good endgame then it will die faster than the company thinks. Plus the community has been asking for these fixed including a fix to the resign system since day 1 and they haven‚Äôt addressed or properly fixed the issue everyone is having. There are multiple better games out there as this one is incomplete with the terrible lack of endgame content. Once you get there you will see that there is literally nothing left to do. Pass on this game and go find a game with good endgame content. You can thank me later.",2
"First of all, I can't believe this game is free to play. It's expansive, includes TONS of characters, has interesting and interactive world building and the lore is is unique. Maintenance is always rewarded generously, and there are CONSTANT events going on. You seriously can't get bored of this game.
 
However, it's poorly optimized and doesn't run well on most devices, which is why I play mainly on my PC. I wish we were allowed to limit render distance so the game would run better. I also wish there were more options for customizing the settings, such as eliminating all the animated grass. I just don't enjoy how it looks personally. 

Otherwise, the gameplay is fun an innovative, they add new mechanics (such as my favorite new mechanic: fishing!) and the daily commissions are extra incentive to play daily. I always have quests to do and areas to explore. I look forward for the content to come! Thank you Mihoyo :)",4
Hello! I love this game sooo much and that‚Äôs why I have it a 5-star just one problem nothing about playing the game just about starting the game. When I first started it let me right it and I played the game for about a hour or so and I chose the girl but I wanted to chose the boy so I deleted the game then got it again but this time it asked me to download the full version so I did and about like an hour later I checked it because I thought it would be done already but it was not even to the middle and I wanted a whole day for it to be done but it was still not even close to the middle I‚Äôm trying to say that the full download takes forever and I mean forever! And the REAL problem is that you must you have to do the full download if you want to play the game! But the game was still fun just maybe change the time of the full version if you guys can<3,5
"I absolutely love this game dearly , I can‚Äôt live a day without it,, when I‚Äôm stressed I just get on and start playing , sometimes I get sad by the fact this game might reach it end and get shut down,, I hope it never does. The memories I made in this game is amazing , I got happy and sad but it‚Äôs all good because I can always make new friends . I love exploring . I love fighting and I love rolling on banners ! The 50/50 does hurt my f2p soul but regardless it‚Äôs still fun . Thank you mihoyo for making this game.. thank you for your hard work and for everything . I love this game so much and I will forever play it even when people will slowly leave  <3 I can‚Äôt explain my happiness or how grateful I am for having an opportunity to play this game hehe I hope someday I get to play with my EU friends (I‚Äôm in NA ) and have a lovely journey dear traveler ! And you too mihoyo ^w^",5
"This is the ONLY, I repeat the ONLY RPG I have actually stuck to playing. I love this game so much and I am honestly beyond addicted. Though it takes quite a while to level up, which in my honest opinion is a good thing. This game is meant to be long. It‚Äôs not one of those games that you join and 10 minutes later you‚Äôre already level 10. You gotta have dedication to play this game. I‚Äôve been playing for 2 months+ and I‚Äôm adventure rank 28. Even though summoning good characters/items can be difficult, it also shows that hard work pays off! The pity system pretty much raises your chances of getting a good character/item at a certain amount of wishes. ( ex: 70 past wishes= 5‚òÜ) after wishing a lot, I finally got Klee, a 5‚òÜ character! Tip: If you have a choice ALWAYS use the limited character banner wishes (use intertwined fate). This game has seriously made me fall in love.... ‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é‚ô•Ô∏é",5
"I generally don‚Äôt write reviews, so I‚Äôll try to keep this short. Genshin Impact is definitely my favorite mobile game I‚Äôve ever played. I definitely would recommend it to just about everyone. The mechanics in the game are easy to use and leveling up actually makes sense. This game is basically a crossover of Nino Kuni, if you‚Äôve ever played it, and Skyrim. I absolutely love this game. So, now on to a few issues I‚Äôve found. This game takes up about 10 gigs of storage, making it impossible to make room for. I‚Äôve practically deleted my whole iPad for it. I‚Äôve also found that the game will randomly crash at points, making me have to open it up and wait for it to load each time it crashes, and it‚Äôs quite annoying. Besides those few things, which I hope they can patch, Genshin Impact is a fantastic game. Thank you so much for reading this, and please go download it and give it a try!",5
I absolutely love this game but the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the 50/50 system I find it pretty unfair for the people like me who have bad luck and end up always losing their 50/50 Im currently on a 50/50 and I really want hu Tao (who is a upcoming character really awesome dps) but I‚Äôm on a 50/50 because I accidentally got another character called xiao or maybe I wish there would be a re funding system where if you got a character by accident you can return them and have guaranteed again of course you can‚Äôt re fund them all the time just 30 days after you got them or like 20 days it would be a lot more helpful hopefully in the future they can do something to fix this issue it‚Äôs really upsetting to get a character you do not want I love xiao but I love Hu Tao way more and it upsets me that I might not get her in this year of 2023 since she barely comes back to the game,5
"I've been playing Genshin impact for almost 2 years old. I never got tired of it! It's really fun. Overall, I wish you guys would fix the problem where when you try to do your normal attack it doesn't attack backwards. You get what i mean? If you don't then okay. Also, the characters are very pretty! Some of more then pretty like, Yae Miko, Raiden Shogun, and Yelan. I would say the male characters are cool but the female characters for just prettier. I downloaded this game in 2021 because I found it on Tiktok. I deleted it though because I thought it was boring. Later on though, I redownloaded it because my friend told me to. I kept getting laughed at because I picked Aether ü•≤. I really like Genshin impact though! Genshin Impact is very fun. I wanted to make a new account for months but I finally found out how to! Genshin Impact is the 2nd most played game I've played. The game is really good. Like REALLY good.",5
"Its amazing to me games are allowed to collect and store troves of personal information. This app wants total access to everything on your phone. Why does a game need to access my contact info? Why does it need to have the ability to access, modify and even delete any photo on my device? Its insane that so many people don‚Äôt understand the consequences. Some random person in china can look and examine every single photo on your phone, copy and save said photo without notifying you. Snap a pic of your ID for employment or other reasons yep this company now has your ID. A sexy selfie for someone. Yep they have that as well. There is no restrictions because you have given permission under the false guise of ‚Äúerror reporting‚Äù or other problems. You think they can only access game related photos but no they get all your photos. Also they get access to your info like emails, phone numbers, age, device info like OS and OS version so they can exploit vulnerabilities. Even worse if you play on PC. Absolutely zero reason for a game to need this info outside of ID theft and stealing period.",1
"This game is extremely stingy for no reason. It is a great game which is why it got a 3/5 stars. It has three main problems. One is that it is a game that forced you to log into the game everyday with its resin system combined with a slim chance to get good gear it takes more than a month to fully complete your character. The second problem is that it is super stingy and greedy right now is the anniversary event for a game that has been out for two years you would expect the game to give us a good reward, but no it gives us a single ten pull     ( you need 90 pulls to get a guaranteed 5 star character) and a trash event that I would assume takes 2-3 hours of boring story that I don‚Äôt care about. I have seen games that make way less money than this game and is way more generous. It is greedy also in the sense of that you need to pull 90 times to get a guaranteed 5 star. The. Once you get a 5 star you only 50/50 chance for your desired 5 star which is a problem because it is extremely hard to get primogems in the late game. So overall this game is extremely mid and needs to be more generous.",1
"At first I kept getting ads and assumed it was the same thing, you know the drill, get the ad, don‚Äôt try it because of assumptions, then play it and it‚Äôs great and you‚Äôre addicted! I tried playing it but I didn‚Äôt like it the first two times because I had a problem and I didn‚Äôt realize it, I didn‚Äôt have enough storage and thought there was something wrong with the game, twice. So this then, I read it throughly and then cleared out a bunch of my storage and started playing. It didn‚Äôt take long to download and my first thought was: Wow, now I get why people are so addicted to this game! It‚Äôs actually very fun! So, thank you for making it and I really recommend it actually for people who need a game. I play it all the time now! I played it in the car earlier, in bed, while waiting in a store, it‚Äôs truly amazing. And you don‚Äôt need wifi so it‚Äôs all good! Thanks again!",5
"There‚Äôs barely any diversity in the characters which makes it really boring. All the characters are incredibly pale and even in the leaks for Sumeru they are all pale. Really disappointing especially because I was looking forward to seeing diversity. With recent leaks I‚Äôve been even more upset. Sumeru is supposed to be based off African and South Asia and yet you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell from looking at the incredibly pale characters. Another thing is there‚Äôs so much lore in limited events that if you don‚Äôt play for every event you‚Äôll miss out on so much. I took almost a year off of the game and as it turns out I missed some HUGE lore dumps like Scaramouche being introduced. It‚Äôs really disappointing to not be able to even play the quests you just miss out completely!! It‚Äôs so hard for new players to understand lore wise what‚Äôs going on and be able to experience the same things that veteran players did. If events were re-run it would make everything better, new players could see lore and characters they would ever get a chance to see in quests otherwise.",1
"If your like me and you love fighting games anime stuff and all the kind of stuff then I guarantee you will absolutely love this game it‚Äôs so fun the bosses are pretty hard to kill if your at about level 1-19 maybe I haven‚Äôt played this in a pretty long time if you ask me, but I recommend playing this it‚Äôs a very adventurous game the characters are ‚ù§Ô∏èADORABLE ‚ù§Ô∏è like the skins/characters so yeah. I just wanted to say how wonderful this game is I recommend playing this when bored or maybe sad if you feel like it. And I will for sure make this a 5 star game. But just one things that I think genshin should do is lower the price to buy wishes because if your saving up like me they should be expensive just for 1 ten pull that is used once. Thank you so much tho hoyoverse for this incredible game it cheers me up all the way I just wanted to say thank you for this amazing game hoyoverse BYE!!!!!!",5
"This may sound clich√© or dramatic, but two months ago I lost my grandmother to kidney failure. She was my best friend in the whole world and I went into a deep state of sadness. My friends texted me about Genshin Impact, so I tried it. I immediately fell in love with the character design and the The Outlander Who Caught the Wind story quest. I‚Äôm not saying that this video game fixed my sadness but it did make me feel more joyful. Although some may say Mihoyo is not genserous to their community, you may be saying something in the ballpark of the truth. Nevertheless Mihoyo has represented that they could build an uplifting community from scratch. Though there are a multitude of reasons I play Genshin Impact, I mostly play for the experience and for fun. Personally I have become very emotionally invested in this game and I have not been disappointed. Thank you to Mihoyo for brightening my world and other‚Äôs. You truly are great.",5
"Now, before I go off about the things I don‚Äôt like, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that this is probably one of the funniest games I‚Äôve played. There‚Äôs a HUGE variety of things to do with a compelling story and charming characters. I mean it‚Äôs heavily inspired by Zelda (breath of the wild to be exact) but it‚Äôs free. But that‚Äôs the thing. I wanna be a f2p gamer but getting a character is so hard. Not to mention the fact that you have to wait for you‚Äôre favorite character‚Äôs banner to come back or might not even come back at all. It‚Äôs stressful because the chances are SOOOOO low and annoying. Ppl can spend a lot of money on the game and not get anything from it, I mean there is literally a 0.6 % chance of getting the banner character. Anyways I think that to fix this problem you should
Number 1: increase the chances of getting a character ( or 4/5 star weapon) and not some useless 3 star weapon 

Number 2:  give me better rewards and more primogems, I mean ppl can reach up to adventure rank 56 and only be given 1 wish which would probably end up being a skyrider sword per usual, maybe at least 10 wishes every 10 adventure rank reached, or 1 wish per adventure rank 

Number 3: I think this the best option which is to add all rerun the banner characters the standard, it doesn‚Äôt have to have a high chance just as long as i know that someone I can bring home venti or zhongli",4
"It is the first time that I have a game of this type and I must say that it is a game in which you are easily hooked by its stories, plot, action etc.  It really is fun and you can spend hours playing it and you don't realize how much time you spend until you realize you've been in it for more than 5 hours, it really seems like a very good game to me.  But it would be great if in a way you could link the game of the PS4 with the mobile so you could advance until when you are traveling or have free time at work I would not mind that the only way to play it is with the control it would be great to be able to playing the Genshin impact account of the PS4 on the mobile I do not know if a certain modification or adjustment could be made for it but I will be waiting for comments to see what the community thinks about this idea as well",5
"Hey y‚Äôall, Genshin Veteran here Haven‚Äôt played in a long while and I greatly enjoy the game it‚Äôs easily a four to five star game but and there‚Äôs a crucial but here I can‚Äôt enjoy it anymore due to the massive storage cost. Deleted the game a while back to take a break a relieve my tablet of the storage and came to the realization on the next update that I couldn‚Äôt download the game again. Wouldn‚Äôt even let me attempt it even with a completely empty tablet save for the necessities of course. I‚Äôm aware that a patch has been made to enable players to delete previously completed quest data and I do appreciate that but for those of use who have played the game, deleted it, and are trying to come back and can‚Äôt what are we to do about it? Anyway thanks for listening to me rant about an issue I found particularly pressing or maybe it‚Äôs just for me in particular. Sincerely, A fellow traveler from afar",4
"I grind for so long to get 10 fates just to pull on the event/standard banner just to get a four star weapon I can‚Äôt use. I spent all day farming to get materials to ascend my characters and get fates to pull on the standard banner, only to get a four star bow which I cannot use because aim on mobile is hard. I don‚Äôt understand why the banners wouldn‚Äôt give us at least one character when there is a whole separate banner for weapons that is up all the time. If I needed more weapons, which I don‚Äôt, because I get 9 every other time I pull, I would pull the weapon banner. I don‚Äôt want to put my time and effort into something that i‚Äôm not guaranteed to get anything useful that i need from. The game doesn‚Äôt have to be incredibly difficult because its free to play, you have many ways to get money by the things you sell and the many others who are willing to pay to help build their characters.

ALSO it is a total lie when it says 3.2gb‚Ä¶ takes up half my phone",3
"ok, yes i‚Äôm just writing this for nahida luck but i actually really enjoy this game. i don‚Äôt log on all that much except for new updates or whenever i feel like it, so im not an endgame player yet and there‚Äôs still a lot for me to do. for new players, there‚Äôs going to be a whole lot, and that avoids what most endgame players complain about. the graphics for this game are absolutely stunning, and the character designs are so pretty and intricate, i find myself just staring at them for a while. the quests are really immersive and fun to play if you don‚Äôt mind the cutscenes. one of my problems with it is i play on mobile, and it  takes up so much storage. i understand this is kind of unavoidable, but it‚Äôs still something i think should be addressed to new players before they find themselves addicted and purging apps and photos to be able to play. definitely not speaking from experience. another problem i have with it is how difficult it is to get primogems when you‚Äôve done everything. you‚Äôve done most if not all quests that give you primogems, and the only way to get more is through daily commissions, that don‚Äôt give you a lot, and buying some. events give some too but they‚Äôre temporary and not always consistent. aside from all that, this is a great game, and one i highly reccomend!",5
"I completely love Genshin impact. I‚Äôve been playing it for almost a year, and first off, the characters are all very good and the GACHA system is pretty good . The characters are super detailed and all unique. The combat is smooth, and the storyline is engaging (yet it is unfinished) And the game is pretty F2P friendly, if your not trying to collect every character. For example, your going for someone like Hu Tao, who is a five-star. Instead of getting her, you get Bennett. Bennett is a Four star that even if he isn‚Äôt a 5-star, he can still carry and help you along the story. The design of the open world is just gorgeous and I love taking pictures. The one very small problem is that I don‚Äôt see as many POC characters. Though, a new place is coming out soon based off Egypt, so I think we‚Äôll be seeing more characters of color. I definitely recommend this game!!",5
I discovered Genshin impact over a year ago because my dad played it and wowowow do I love it I really do like how there‚Äôs events frequently and there‚Äôs a LOT of content especially when you join the game now! I do love the free rewards when you first join :) I do have to say (so far) after about adventure rank 45-60 there‚Äôs not a lot of content left to play but there‚Äôs still a lot of stuff you can do even after there‚Äôs not a lot of content coming out and I do love welkin! I do think it‚Äôs worth the $5 I‚Äôve gotten it multiple times and no regrets! It definitely helps if your trying to save primogems for a character that you want!  I do wish there was more ways to obtain primogems as an F2P but overall the game really has no flaws to me! I do enjoy the new patches ever 40ish days! To anyone who‚Äôs reading this review I hope you get the game and enjoy it as much as I do :),5
"This game is amazing with a couple of flaws. The two main problems I have is the co op and I can‚Äôt find anything to do. The co op feels kind of pointless when you can‚Äôt interact with npcs or things like the black smith. The second problem I have is there isn‚Äôt really any quest I can find. Sure you can do the bounty‚Äôs, daily commission‚Äôs, boss battles, and the reputation commissions, but it all has a limit of some sort. The bounty‚Äôs you can only do three per week same goes for the reputation commissions. The daily commissions only have four per day. Then the boss battles. They are pricey for resin, so they seem pointless to do if your out of resin. If you could just make the co op more interactive and give out more side quest to do it would make the game way more enjoyable.

Edit: I just crafted a portable waypoint and when I tried to use it I deleted it by accident. If you could add a screen asking if you are sure you want to delete the waypoint that would be nice.",4
"Let me just say this first. The game is fun. It will have you hooked for hours running around for all sorts of crazy shiny things across the world. It‚Äôs beautiful and wholesome and I do enjoy it‚Ä¶ most of the time. The game however is plagued with annoying additions that really make me not want to enjoy this game as much as I should. Several quests have had me consider throwing my  iPad into a wall with how tedious and frustrating they can be. Bugs that cost me a character at a critical moment, monster designs that make me think ‚Äúwho thought this was a good idea‚Äù and of course the god awful leveling up system are just some examples of why I simply can‚Äôt say this game is great (debatably it‚Äôs not even good) 
Again think the game is fun overall, just needs work. A lot of work. 

Oh and whoever had the brilliant idea to make quests turn off the co op feature should be fired and banned from ever touching a laptop ever again. Do you hate fun  or do you just not care?",3
"So my cousin has been playing this game a lot and they‚Äôre obsessed and then my best friend started playing it‚Ä¶now he‚Äôs obsessed so i decided to try it out. When i downloaded it and opened it, it said i need more storage so i deleted four apps and all my photos and i had 53.4 of 64GB used so i was confused, i turned my phone all the way off and on and tried again, once again it said i needed more storage. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling it again, but when i deleted it, it wouldn‚Äôt let me download it again, so again i turned my phone off and on again. Once my phone turned back on I tried downloading it again, it still wouldn‚Äôt let me download it, i tried downloading another app to see if it was the app store itself but the other app downloaded just fine, so i deleted the app i downloaded and tried downloading Genshin again but it just wouldn‚Äôt work, im really confused and kinda upset because I really wanted to try this out. Please help me fix this.",3
"So I followed this game through development as it always interested me. As a fan of anime and anime games and breath of the wild being one of my favorite games, just a polished beautiful, fun to explore, and awe inspiring masterpiece that it is, my interest in this game was high. Now I know it doesn‚Äôt have the polish of the financial backing that a game like BOTW would have but when this came out I downloaded it super excited and spent the day playing. First impression ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright I guess‚Äù put it down for like 8 months and picked it back up a couple days ago just bored and I have to tell you this games mechanics and systems go deep. The story is great, combat is so fun, all the characters you get to use, and I‚Äôm having an absolute blast seeing what‚Äôs Behind every corner or down every valley or up every mountain. I‚Äôm so happy I gave this game another chance it‚Äôs a charming little gem!",5
I‚Äôm in a hard place in my life right now with no way out. This game is the highlight of my day. Finding things that distracted me from the abuse I‚Äôm going through are hard to find let alone keep. I‚Äôve had this game for about 3 weeks and my mental health has improved. The characters are interesting and unique. The graphics are nice plus the game almost never glitches. There‚Äôs no need to spend money on the game unless you really don‚Äôt want to wait to get a character. The story plot it follows is interesting and introduces the characters as your adventure level go‚Äôs up. The people I‚Äôve met and talk to on this game have been so kind. I‚Äôve never met someone who was rude in the game or the fandom. My one ad only minor complaint would be that there should be more characters of color. I have yet to see a black character but I‚Äôm also not super far into the game.,5
"I have never reviewed a game before, but I had to for Genshin Impact. My phone is constantly full of games that I download, play for a week or two, and get bored of and delete. Genshin is definitely not going to be one of those. 

It‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful open world with great character designs, good plot, and lots of side quests to keep me interested. Even better: it plays like a solo player game and doesn‚Äôt constantly throw pay-only opportunities at you. I feel like I can play in peace without having to make a bunch of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in a guild I don‚Äôt care about or never able to do anything really fun without shelling out real money to get to a certain VIP level. Really, the only downside is the fact that it eats my battery up and I have to plug in to keep going. But the fact that I want to keep playing even plugged up to my too short charger just shows how great the game is!

Highly recommend!",5
"Hi, I was thinking one thing that would make Genshin even more fun is pets! It would be so cool if players could battle creatures and if they win, choose to keep the creature they fought. We could use these creatures in battles and even ride them (kinda like the wave riders in sumeru). A creature I'd really like to have is a fire bird that can fly. You can ride the bird while flying (the flying wouldn't be restricted to low on the ground you could fly up into the sky and any where you wanted). I would also like to see a dragon (same thing like the fire bird in terms of flight). Pleeeeeeease ü•πü•πü•πü•πüíôüíôüíô

And if nothing else can you please make it so we can pet the dogs and cats we see on the map? Everytime I see one I want to interact with it but the only thing I can do is scare it by hitting it with my sword ‚òπÔ∏è. 

Thank you for reading my response and I hope you at least take my ideas into consideration. Have a wonderful day!üíôü¶ã",4
"Hello devs and other people from the Genshin impact staff team. I love what you guys have done to this game, I can tell it‚Äôs a inspiration of legend of Zelda breath of the wild, which was a beautiful game indeed. Including your game as well devs/staff members. I love the art work so points for that, love the fighting system so points for that as well and finally playing with friends! That‚Äôs gotta be the best part, now if u guys can make this even better that would be amazing. Alright anyways what the title of the comment says ‚ÄúController support for IOS‚Äù please add support for that, you guys already do that for pc and ps4 why not IOS. Please devs and staff members, add some love for the mobile community by adding controller support so we players can have a easy time enjoying your beautiful game with an controller instead of our fingers on a screen. Thank you for your time and I hope you guys have a beautiful life and health one as well.",5
"Hello Mihoyo, I hope your seeing this. First of all I just want to say that Genshin Impact is super fun to play and it‚Äôs literally the only thing that saves me from boredom. Second is I have a really cool idea that I think a lot of players would like. If possible, is there any way you can make a thing where you can duel other players? If you don‚Äôt get what I mean let me explain. So basically, you could ask someone to duel and you bring along four characters. If the person accepts the request you will be automatically be sent to a open area to duel. After you and your opponent click ready, the game will begin. While your opponent charges at you or decides to dodge, you also unleash attacks. To make this more simple, your basically fighting a monster accept that monster is your player opponent. I get if your too busy to do this but please consider!",5
"It‚Äôs been 2yrs and I can‚Äôt believe this game is free to play when it‚Äôs an entire, complete video game with regular updates and events. I know people complain about gacha and the amount of content, but you genuinely don‚Äôt need to use gacha to play, and there‚Äôs an obscene amount of content (especially if you‚Äôre someone with a full time job and other hobbies lol). You can play difficult end game content with F2P characters if you put in the time and look up one of the hundreds of guides online for F2P team comps üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAnd you don‚Äôt NEED the battle pass to get the most of the game; you don‚Äôt need to buy the Welkin Moon.

If you want to run around and explore and go through a story and side quests for 70hrs+, Genshin has your back. idk it‚Äôs just wild to me that it‚Äôs free (and that people complain like it‚Äôs not ‚Äúactually‚Äù free??) It really, really is a full game for $0.",5
"I hesitantly downloaded Genshin over a year and a half ago.  I had very low expectations as everyone called it a ‚ÄúBreath of the wild‚Äù ripoff.  Very quickly I discovered that the open world and exploration were the similarities ended (maybe the climbing mechanic and cooking are also similar).  What I found was that this was an extremely polished game that had a very engaging world full of characters and stories.  I have loved every minute in game and discussing it when away from it.  The music, the graphics and gameplay are all fantastic.  The game is generous too.  You can actually do pretty well with just four star characters, I personally have pulled characters because I love the design and the way they enrich the gameplay.  The lore is also really, really good.  I really enjoy this game and hope you will too.  Happy second Anniversary!!",5
"This game is so much fun! There are lots of characters and quests. There‚Äôs always something to do! It‚Äôs really fun! The only issues I‚Äôve experienced are that it takes 5 to 10 minutes to get into the game. This isn‚Äôt a horrible issue, and its worth the waiting. It just gets a little annoying some times. The other issue is that I can‚Äôt watch videos. In the being cutscene and all the other cutscenes it freezes and the voice gets staticky. This is super annoying! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs like that for everybody or just me, but please look into it. Other than these things the game is amazing! I really recommend it to others! And it dose take lots of storage, but it‚Äôs totally worth it! If the developers just look into these couple issues, the game would be perfect! It‚Äôs the best game ever! Keep up the great work developers! <3 <3",5
"They continue to ignore calls from the fandom to provide skin diversity within their game. The only have two brown characters that they  white wash in their own official art. Also the new region tht is coming out is based on the SWANA region but the characters don‚Äôt reflect this. Most of them are pasty white tht look like they will burn in the sun. People have being calling from darker skin characters for a long time and this was their opportunity to heed these calls. I never been in a fandom tht is so colorist or played a game by a company that is so colorist. They want to use brown and black as inspiration for a nation but they can‚Äôt even give space for those same type of ppl to exist within the game. I‚Äôm tired and I have no plans to continue purchasing primos to get any of the future characters. I implore other to do same, and that new players find another game to play especially if you are darker than a brown paper bag lol. This fandom and company is a mess that can play with own mental health regarding your skin if u are weak of heart. I‚Äôm disappointed but not shocked 
Sincerely, a black fan",1
"I have spent a lot of time playing this game since it was recommended to me 2-3 months ago, and I have made lots if progress, reaching Inazuma, unlocking the bottom of the Chasm, have level 60+ characters, etc‚Ä¶ Lately, there has been a massive connection issue, where it will start loading, and damage will only register onto me, which means my character dies when the opponent dies if enough damage was done. Not only that, but although it may be integrated this way, I have begun to grow distant from this game after reaching AR 40 and having to deal with level 70+ NPC enemies, and bosses. I main as Razor and Bennet, and although having done around 50 pulls on the Ayaka banner that has been present since I started playing, I have not gotten close to having a single character who is completely worthy of building. Aside from all of this, the graphics are great, the gameplay is stunning, and the Co-Op feature is a fun way to help lower leveled players.",3
"I see a lot of people complaining about the primo gems thing, but if you are grinding out the game and are willing to buy the welkins thing you can get almost a wish a day for a month (28 wishes) by also completing all the commissions. And if you need some primo gems just grind out dragon spine I got like 300 primo gems from the quests alone and probably another 300 from all the chests and then 100 for all the achievements and like 50 for all the waypoints so roughly 750 primo gems from dragon spine alone not counting the frost bearing tree rewards. If you are going to complain about lack of in-game currency on a game that offers it for free in practically everything you do then you need to get your priorities straight, however if you are going to complain about getting Qiqi and a skyward atlas instead of any good reasonable 5 star then I‚Äôm all ears.",5
"So.. usually when I see games like this I expect it to be a knock off version of something, or its just not a type of game where you say ‚ÄúHey, I love
this game so much I play it multiple hours a day!‚Äù Yeah no. But over the past few months or more, I have been getting dozens of ads for this game. Of course, I would always skip it. Assuming its not gonna be enjoyable. But just about 2-3 maybe 4 days ago, I finally gave in and downloaded it. Usually I guess how a games going to be based of the ad, and most of them basically lied so far. But, this one was actually pretty nice. There is so much to do, and its so fun to play. All the characters are super unique and cute and I think its just a really good game! One of my favorite parts about the game are the wing glider things. I just like walking off the edge of the cliff and flying off. Very fun, would recommend.",5
"I absolutely love Genshin, it‚Äôs a great game and I enjoy all its content, however there are a few issues. I‚Äôve played Genshin before on the PS4 and it ran rather smoothly, so I was surprised when the mobile version wasn‚Äôt as well done as the PS4 version. What I mean by this is when I downloaded Genshin onto my iPad, the game frequently crashes and glitches. I can barely even tap into my quests, wishes, team party, or anything of the sort without the game crashing, and me having to log back into the game. Another small issue is that some content is exclusive only to the PS4, so I just ask that some of this be taken care of. I would download Genshin on the PS4, but in doing that I risk all my data being erased and restarting from scratch- so please mihoyo fix the crashing issue, I really don‚Äôt want to have to restart but the crashing is so frequent üòîüòîüòî",5
"Kokomi is a 5*. Her value should be comparable to 4* c6 character but she does not. She is outlclassed by so many 4 stars. Yes she gives hydro off field hydro application, and tons of heals but that is not enough for a five *. Her jelly fish aoe is small , no reposition. Trash damge can‚Äôt compare. Terrible kit. A healer that needs to be on the field (her elemental burst require u to be in field). What a piece of garbage unit. If ur gonna give her hp scaling and take away crit, at least give her decent scaling. She is so bad. Her kit is so wacky. Love her design but whooooo made her kit. Where is the balance team. Kokomi jelly fish does constant 99 damage. Garbage, during her ult it does maybe 1-2k but guess what she needs to be on the field and can‚Äôt reposition it. Garbage. Why is she built like a hyper carry???? If u want ppl satisfied. Either make her elemtal burst not selfish, or give her hp scaling better so she is comparable to other dps. Also her jelly fish really needs some rework in numbers. It‚Äôs pathetic. Give jelly fish go scaling. For goodnes sake u took away her crit. At least justify that.",2
"I‚Äôve been supporting this game since it‚Äôs release and has not done a thing to get my account back due to losing it because of their bad security. It‚Äôs absolutely horrible. They clearly don‚Äôt care about their service because they are over here answering irrelevant questions (Aka obvious trolls) and won‚Äôt bat an eye to those who need actual help. There are multiple reports of people getting their account hacked because of their bad security and the furthest report said they got their account back after 5 months. Company says there‚Äôs different facilities for each problem, then why is it taking so long? Why am I constantly seeing reports of people saying they haven‚Äôt gotten their account back after 2+ months? It‚Äôs horrible and just straight up neglect, I paid money on this game so of course I would be uneasy, they need to take better care of their consumers if they actually want players and at least fix the security ONCE AGAIN. That 2FA is not enough to stop hackers from entering and from a big company full of talented coders, they should know that by now.",1
"This game has been on my radar for a couple of months now. Gotta say I‚Äôm pleased with the results. It‚Äôs sort of a clone of botw but has enough of its on content and mechanics that make it stand on its own. The exploration in this game is amazing, and while there are cash grabs in game none of them seem to be required or really off scale the game like that (you‚Äôll just need to make sure grind if you don‚Äôt play). Top it all off with the fact that there‚Äôs a pic client and you can literally pick up where you left off from your mobile adventure. I think this ones a winner. Now I‚Äôm not sure why there isn‚Äôt any controller support for iOS devices l especially when controller use is a wide thing nowadays. Nothing wrong with the on screen controls just like the feeling of pressing buttons. That‚Äôs the only real gripe I have have with this game which is honestly minuscule. Peeps pick this one up, it‚Äôs new, it‚Äôs free, it‚Äôs fun",5
"This game is stunning! Exploration is a pleasure because you never know what you‚Äôll find; the story is decent, and it‚Äôs really satisfying to pull off elemental reactions! I do have some gripes though. As a F2P player, getting new characters is hard. You can (mostly) only do so through wishing (gambling). It probably is possible to progress to end game without a super diverse roster, but I only have two archers and I can‚Äôt increase the level cap of one because I haven‚Äôt made it to a certain region. This brings me down to one useable archer. This could pose some problems with bosses, and this is where I have to wish. Trying to get new characters is hard for F2P players because you get little more than 60 primogems (currency to buy wishes) daily. To make 10 wishes, you need 1600 primogems. This is how the game entices you to spend money. If you are prone to a gambling addiction, do not download this game!",4
"Okay, this game is more four stars because it‚Äôs pretty Pat to win, but please hear me out on a couple things before you play. 
The game is similar to breath of the wild in some aspects and is a very beautifully animated game. Most of the characters don‚Äôt have too much fan service and the story is actually pretty interesting. While I do have to say the current banner system is pretty bad since it can be hard to get characters especially if you‚Äôre free to play or don‚Äôt spend a lot, the game is a very well made game that is free. If you‚Äôre considering following the genshin channels for news if recommend steering clear from some of the community which is quite toxic at times. As a perso. Who‚Äôs been playing for almost two years, I really hope to see more improvements and am very excited to see where this goes to in the coming years.",5
"I love this game so much. All though every time I play it, eventually something happens and I have to start a new account. But that‚Äôs fine! I just think a few things could be added to the game. 1. This one is about the traveler. This game is very creative. But what would make it even more creative is if the traveler had different attack animations for each element. 2. We‚Äôve all seen the little Japanese cushion seats in the Komore Teahouse and Kamisato Estate. What if u made it so we could sit on them? And finally 3. We know there are beds in genshin. We‚Äôve all seen it. But what if we could SLEEP on those beds? I‚Äôm sure if the game were exactly like real life every character we have would be exhausted because they get no sleep. Pls Hoyoverse take these into consideration and pls if u can‚Äôt do all of them pls do at least one. These are minor things I really wanna see in the game!",5
"I didn't have to delete alot honestly - worked just fine ‚Äî would give five stars if they hadn't removed guest accounts, although I understand cause I would assume people like trollers or hackers would find a way to get online ‚Äî so, that's all y'all can get away with but still angry on the fact that I had Yanfei, (that one Electro that pulls that sword out of her boobas,) noelle (useless but I loved her voice lines and her outfit in general, decent character,) and alot more (it's been a year so I can't rlly remember all of them) but Yanfei was my dream... (I'm better now cuz I got that ninja loi ‚Äî she's cute, bean sized raccoon girl??) but, I don't really mind loosing the characters and the guest account cuz (pausing real quick just to say I also had ningaug‚Äî) it doesn't bother me to just simply make a new account that wasn't guest‚Äî (expected something like this to happen, don't get me wrong‚Äî) but, yeah have a good day thanks for reading.",4
"Genshin isn‚Äôt a American or western based game, it‚Äôs literally made in a place that doesn‚Äôt give a flip about meaningless garbage such as diversity or representation. If you have a problem with that you either need to move on or seriously get a life outside of social media. Coming from someone who‚Äôs black as well, I could care less about not seeing characters that look like me since I can relate to characters and like them regardless of skin tone. Even if they did add in characters like that, if they were stale or boring In anyway or not likable I really wouldn‚Äôt care. If they do, good for them, if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not going to lose sleep at night and whine like a toddler on here or social media over something as meniscal as that. Honestly the fact that the recent reviews are like this is both pathetic and just downright sad. Western fans are such a stain on this community.",5
"Genshin Impact is, by far, my favorite rpg even though I‚Äôve only been playing for 2 days. However, although the game is amazing, and I love the feel of it. I have two problems. One, the game keeps crashing, now this problem I can understand because the game is new, there‚Äôll be some bugs. Not to mention the reason it keeps crashing could be my phone‚Äôs problem, not the games. However, the next problem I‚Äôm 99% sure is the games fault. I can‚Äôt login. I used to login using Game Center, but whenever I try to login it says ‚Äúthird-party not registered.‚Äù I don‚Äôt understand this because, first off, I‚Äôm using the same device so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm logging in from a completely new device. Secondly, Game Center has always worked, so why is it saying that now? I really want to login into my account because I‚Äôve made decent progress and don‚Äôt want to have to start over from the beginning. So please, if you know a way to fix this, please do share.",4
"As a new player who just reached Adventure Rank 23-24, the game is super nice so far. I like the graphics, mechanics, and mechanisms. Finding quests to complete is a blast and I would recommend this to 1 or 2 of my friends. 

However, I do not like the fact that the chances of getting a five star, let alone a new character, is super hard. I did receive Noelle from the beginner banner, but even after saving up to 30 Aquant (sorry idk how to spell it) stars/ gems, I have yet to get a single new character. Also another common issue is the storage mobile players such as myself will probably run into this issue at some point. I had to offload the app and sign in again with my old account just to continue playing. I was informed this game was available on the switch, but it wasn‚Äôt released at all. 

Overall: If you have a gaming console or computer please use it instead! If not, you can buy more storage or offload app to see if it helps!!",3
"So I've been playing this game since October 2020. You probably won‚Äôt see this but please fix Yae Miko. Ive had trouble building her because she has no health, her attacks are extremely slow, and she has to be on the field more than Fischl. People are only defending her because she is a 5 star and she has a good design. She does have a really good design, but shes not enough. Fischl is currently better than Yae because she is easy to build, her constellations are easy to unlock and she is more flexible with less field time. Yae Miko has harder to get constellations, and needs a lot of field time... This part is about her burst, she needs 90 E R points which is a lot considering that she is a five star, she has a long cool down, her elemental skill is broken too, it targets things like campfires, and torches. It is a loss of damage and pretty disappointing. The whole community would love if you would fix her. Im looking forward to seeing Yae being buffed in the future. Thank you for your time..<3",3
"(Before you read this text some parts can may be spoilers) This game is very good and awesome there may be a lot of graphics that makes you lag an all which of course takes a lot of storage but you can say that it‚Äôs worth it! I have been playing this a month after it was created and it started off not so good but it eventually fixed now I love it! This game is about adventure and you can also learn real stuff that is from other countries. I don‚Äôt really want to spoil it but of course there is characters according to the images, and you can trust me that you can either LOVE these characters or either adore them. And again, you can be in a adventure and learn things about different country and the things or stuff that you will see or you can learn, about partial things that you learn about this game, is true in real life.",5
"So I have been playing Genshin since February, and it was like love at first sight. The graphics are incredible, especially for a free game. The character designs are beautiful. The open world factor of the game makes everything so interesting. Honestly I could write a ten page essay why this game is the best, but I also came to make a suggestion. My only issue/ complaint I have with the game is that you can't add friends from different servers or play co op with them. For me, this is really frustrating since I have a lot of online friends from Europe or just friends who like servers where they're from better. I feel like there might be a reason why you can't add friends from other servers (like difficulty connecting in co op, etc.) but if it's possible, I really think it would make the game more enjoyable. 

Happy traveling!",5
"I‚Äôm sure many people have heard of Genshin Impact by now, and I have to say it‚Äôs for good reason. This game is genuinely so fun and immersive to play, plus the characters designs and backstories baffle me with all of their detail. Of course no amazing game like this doesn‚Äôt have problems, and I will say Genshin Impact has its fair share. If you‚Äôve played / are currently playing it you might relate to this, but I find that theres not a lot of content in the game at the moment. When you first start playing the developers introduce you to this fantastic world and story, but after you‚Äôve finished all the quests you‚Äôre left a little empty handed. Nonetheless, this game never fails to be amaze me and keep me entertained for a good while. Do keep in mind it takes quite a toll on your storage space, but if you have enough storage to download it then I highly recommend playing this game.",5
"I started out a month after launch and everything was REALLY fun (exploring, meeting new characters, engaging with the community), but after a certain point it feels like Mihoyo just stopped caring about its playerbase and went completely silent. 

End-game players have been voicing their opinions about how they feel and what they should add since the earlier versions of the game and nothing has been done whatsoever, just some small updates that are so niche. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I just log in and do commissions because there‚Äôs literally nothing to do after completing abyss, 100% exploring, and waiting for resin recharge. 

I can still voice my opinion without all the Genshin Knights saying to just quit the game. But after all the countless hours and money i‚Äôve put in to this game it‚Äôs only fair that I get to do so. In all honestly i‚Äôll stop supporting this game with my money and if a better game comes out, i‚Äôll drop this one. But for now i‚Äôll keep playing‚Ä¶",3
"Okay im not one who‚Äôs like mean. well okay no i am pretty mean but its always unintentional or its towards someone im close with so they don't take it personally. But Mihoyo,, the anniversary rewards :(

I want to keep playing and i plan to play until the very end!(unless smth happens that makes me change my mind) Just, you can make up for the rewards,  i still have hope. Like maybe a special anniversary Wind Glider! Or maybe a special food recipe! Maybe even primos‚Äî Now dont get me wrong,  the new web event for the anniversary was super cute and i love it.

I love the game, the story line, the characters, the bosses, enemies , everything! i didn‚Äôt really have any friends but now im in a small social group of classmates because we bonded over genshin!

Hmm, players really like that lantern rite ‚Äúpick a 4* liyue character for free!‚Äù event. And honestly what about that again? Maybe we can pick a 4* character from all the regions? im not sure but these are just some ideas ive seen people online hype about.

Im excited for sumeru! Ive seen some people say that apparently its based off of the mountains in Java Indonesia! Ive had ideas(purely guessing) that Sumeru is like a dessert and its main city/inhabited place is like an Oasis! And that they have an underground water source, and thats since its the nation of dendro, its full of greenery.",5
"I made review but it was removed or didn‚Äôt go through. They is many people in the community also some artists who wish that Venti was female then male. PLEASE Just make Venti into a female character already. It's abundantly apparent; especially from how outsiders to Genshin lore treat the character, that Venti is 100% perceived as being female. We know that all archons are considered genderless beings, agender but we all wish to address are Goddess/Queen Venti as she/her and clam Venti as Waifu which the term means wife. Venti is everyone favorite Archon we all love and wish for a hangout quest for them. The ""lore"" would require minimal changes and not even new voice actors for Venti at all. The narrative, fan art, disposition of the character isn't particularly gender neutral and the fact that the ""ELF spirit"" has taken the form of a friend means a lot but who said Venti couldn‚Äôt just alter the gender to be female counterpart to they friend the nameless bard. The form doesn't even need to be changed to pass off as female. Venti has been embraced by fans and content creators who clearly do not know the lore, but refer to Venti as ""she"" in their content. Until it happens 1 star rating.",1
"I enjoy this game A LOT. I play it for HOURS!! I love the graphics and everything. This game is just immaculate lol. Anyways there is one thing that annoys me a whole lot and it has to do with quests. Basically I am tired of getting stuck on a hard quest and then my Co-Op goes away like why. I‚Äôm just strolling through the map then a quest pops up so I press navigate. Then I realize the quest is way to hard  and my characters aren‚Äôt strong enough to beat it. What bothers me is that I cannot cancel the quest. I have been stuck on this quest called Trials of Tranque or something like that, but it‚Äôs so hard and I can‚Äôt pass it. Now my Co-Op is gone (has been for like 2 WEEKS) and I can‚Äôt play with my friends until I beat this quest that is way to difficult. So I‚Äôm just asking to please add a feature that lets you cancel quests.

Thank you for reading :)",5
"Even though I rate this at 5 stars, I don‚Äôt recommend playing it on the phone because it runs at far fewer frames than on PC or a console and the game chews through your phone‚Äôs battery. Go grab Genshin Impact on PC or on the consoles and you would enjoy the game much more. This game is very much like Breath of the Wild in terms of being a sight seeing simulator, which is a good thing if you love exploring and searching for secrets, puzzles or random battles. If you didn‚Äôt like Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact might not be your cup of tea. The rates for 5 star characters is extremely low but you can probably beat the game with the free characters given to you. So far the game does not have a pity system for 5 star characters so beware of spending any amount of money on the game, you could spend hundreds or thousands and not get a 5 star character. Avoid spending a lot on the game and have fun with what you‚Äôre given.",5
"This game is extremely fun when you play with friends because you can help each other in co-op and just run around doing some exploring. I never used to have a lot of time for genshin, maybe once a week I would play which was usually on the weekends because all the domains would be open. So sad to say but I only had like 4 characters decently built, meaning their talents were sitting at 8-7-5, 5-7-4, 8-9-9, 4-4-4 and that took me 6 months of actually farming. Before I would just pull for a character in the current banner and use them. Now I have 7 characters built with really good damage and did my first triple crown within September! My point is if you don‚Äôt have a lot of time this game isn‚Äôt for you lol. After a while you get burnt out because you‚Äôre running around doing the same thing with each login.",5
"My friends and I all play this game together and we spend pretty consistently on welkins, battle passes, and crystals for summons. We love this game, but one of us has had a super simple email issue (which should be the easiest thing in the world to fix) and has spent MONTHS trying to get it resolved, to no avail. There is NO ONE at hoyoverse helping customers. No phone number to call, no text chat option, NOTHING. Just some lame automated forms incapable of dealing with the most basic issue. Not being able to play with our friend has made us all slowly lose interest in the game and want to quit altogether. What‚Äôs sad is if it wasn‚Äôt for this tiny issue, we‚Äôd have all kept playing and spending not even knowing that hoyoverse was so negligently cutting corners with customer support. Don‚Äôt let these giant corporations keep getting away with rolling back even the most basic features. A live human customer support department is the LEAST a multi-billion dollar company owes its loyal player base. Billions in profits, but you can‚Äôt afford rent at a call center? Do better.",1
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong genshin has amazing qualities such as their music, the lore, the graphics and etc. BUT. Those 2 stars are for how THERES NO DIVERSITY. Sumeru really proved everything. They are a racist company who has so much money to support and make DIFFERENT SKIN COLORS. Sumeru characters are practically pale white BUT FOR WHAT? Because they‚Äôre racist and they just cannot seem to imagine having a diversity. The archon. Is pale. White. Like what?? Hoyoverse changed to that so they can get a more global review but they are just not listening!! The more they do this the more they will lose a lot and will it hurt us? No. But it will hurt them so why are they not listening!!!! This game used to be one of my favorites but now it just feels like a chore to login..I don‚Äôt feel the excitement I felt when I first started this game and I hate it. I barely even login now as the events are becoming more and more mediocre and the story is practically the only thing I look forward too? But who knows they might just mess that up too at some point. Fix your game Hoyoverse. üòê",2
I hate the new Chasm quest and the fact that other players including myself can‚Äôt unlock the archon quest without completing it. It‚Äôs a very long and tedious quest with a lot of mini quests involved in it and it can be very complex to solve. Mind you not everyone has the time to complete this within a day as they have other responsibilities. I also feel bad for players who have to leave the game for months due to their personal lives and can‚Äôt enjoy the archon quest without dealing with the chasm. In my opinion it seems like the chasm quest is like a spin off the dragon spine and while dragon spine was fun I don‚Äôt think players care for a spin off. Since the chasm quest is so tedious and you can‚Äôt enjoy the archon quest until it‚Äôs complete it takes the fun out of the game also for me and many other players. I think they should have made the quest either less elaborate or let players unlock the archon quests without having to deal with the chasm. So players can choose when to play both. The chasm quest is just really frustrating and I‚Äôm sick of trying to complete it at this point.,1
"Mihoyo i love you and genshin, so the problem is that, why is the maintence so long to wait for? Im always on google/chrome looking for the time in asia. And 14:00 and 19:00?! Oh nah ima time skip, this thing has me crying being mad and crying my but on genshin for it to make the time faster. And i just dont really want to wait, i love this game very very much. But im still gonna ask why does the maintence so long to wait for? Im not THAT patient but im still asking, im not not sure of if your making the time longer for some reason, or just to make people more patient. Yes yes this review might be dumb and blah blah blah. But im still gonna beg for the time to be shorter even tho mihoyo wont see this. But all im asking for is the time in the maintence to be shorter next time or all updates we have, im very excited but i feel like this is what you have to fix, and rewrite. Thats my little problem for now. I hope this can be fixed

"I‚Äôve played Genshin for pretty much over a year nowadays and it‚Äôs become moreover boring during the latest gameplay. 

Although I appreciate and admire Hoyoverse and everyone whose work on Genshin Impact, in the long run, Genshin becomes a tedious process moreover than a game.

The quests to complete in order to participate for events feels like a chore, a task. 

Genshin Impact is a fun open-world RPG with a creativity and spark like no other that can‚Äôt be replicated so simply but if you take the gameplay, it‚Äôs not all that it plays up to be.

The wishing system is also a major drawback. It seems rigged for the amount of wishing in order to attain a five-star, a top tier, just for better gameplay.

Which seems like a massive pushover, because although the gameplay is enjoyable to an extent, the fact that you‚Äôre practically forced or furthermore pressured into wishing for better characters and weapons to better the gameplay is a grand cinch.

As much as I love the gameplay, the lore, the visuals, the characters, etc. The cons, in my opinion, outweigh the remarkable prospects by too much.

Thus causing a currently former-player to delete itself as a whole. I‚Äôm considering re-downloading because I‚Äôve become to miss the 
gameplay but the constant rubbish this app provides is a weighted score.

Best of luck and wishes to everyone who plays and the team who created such a novelty.",3
I love the game it‚Äôs really fun and so addictive. I have been playing for a year now and I was supposed to write a review at the time but I was so busy playing the game. I have a few suggestions but there isn‚Äôt really much to change. I look forward to future updates and can‚Äôt wait to see how all the stories and the game develop. -I wrote this a while ago. Quite some time actually but I was just wondering when you were gonna make it available on MacBook or any Mac computer at all. I‚Äôve been playing mobile and it‚Äôs hard to download new versions and different stuff because of the storage. It‚Äôs quite annoying but it‚Äôs not your fault. I was just wondering if you were ever gonna make it available to any Mac computer because I‚Äôve been waiting. It would be greatly appreciated if it was available on those platforms too.,5
"I give this 3 stars but my few problems are that I have enough storage on my phone to download thsi then when you get inside the app you have to download another thing which when I tried it said I had insufficient storage so I deleted most of apps losing all my Proggress in them and data just to realize this is a glitch I wasted all of that time deleted 47 apps for this. My other problem is, is that during the Klee Sumer event a year ago I was trying so hard to get Klee that I burnt out. I think sometimes it can be really hard to get primo gems I was playing the game for 8 hours per day, Also the chances of getting a good character are really low. This is my final problem I‚Äôm i. A quest right now where I need to complete challenges and it‚Äôs disabled my co op mode and the problem is one of the challenges is getting to the top of a thingy I can‚Äôt do that without someone like venti who can help me fly. There are Rarely any characters to help fly in the wish thingy. :(",3
"Genshin Impact is a great game, I love it, but in my state where I live there is barely any people who can afford storage to get the app. The app waste many of your storage to those who can‚Äôt afford much storage. If you got genshin impact on the computer it doesn‚Äôt waste much storage but once you get it on the phone and play a lot, and a lot, it starts wasting your storage. If your in a state like Japan, you get probably all the storage you can have, but some people are in little states that don‚Äôt have much money to afford storage for these kind of games. Besides the storage problem, it‚Äôs a completely amazing game. I play this game up to probably 4 in the morning. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm obsessed with this game, but I when I‚Äôm bored and have nothing to do, I play this all day. It gives away my stress to issues I have and makes something enjoyable! I would have gave this app a 4-5 stars but I only gave it 3 because of the storage problem. Love the game!",3
"I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, I also don‚Äôt normally play games on my phone but honestly this game has been awesome! The lack of mandatory in-app purchases and ads alone, paired with really high quality graphics, music, voice acting, and story really make this feel like a console game....that I‚Äôm carrying in my pocket. I only stopped playing because I had to complete a *ton* of side quests to level up in order to move the main story along ‚Äî I don‚Äôt love the level requirements for certain things and wish at least the main storyline followed the characters‚Äô current level. (That‚Äôs the only reason it‚Äôs not 4 stars for me!)

Otherwise, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that is a similar format to Zelda: Breath of the Wild, this one is it! (Obviously, not actually breath of the wild just with the enemies, quest systems, and other overall systems are similar). I was seriously addicted to this game for a few weeks and absolutely cannot wait for its release on Switch.",4
"the game is good for the first bit but then you realize the lore literally doesn‚Äôt progress, you‚Äôre just helping other ppl. the only person that ever even tries to help you find your sibling is AMBER. ONE OF THE FIRST CHARACTERS YOU EVER MEET üíÄüíÄ i had fun with this game and grinded a lot on my main. i made an alt account and then realized how unrewarding this game is. i remember they used to give out more primos for finding chests but they lowered it for some reason. on my main i bought the welkin and BP. without that i would‚Äôve stopped playing ages ago because it feels like you have to grind hours and hours for ONE WISH, if you don‚Äôt pay you get nothing. i still like the game, just feels like a waste of time when the lore isn‚Äôt progressing and you get little to no rewards for doing anything. the fact that this game will take 10 years to even finish is absolutely ridiculous, i‚Äôm not gonna sit around for ten years being like ‚ÄúOMG 1 PRIMO IM SO LUCKY‚Äù üòí no thanks.(p.s. you cant play this game on your ipad, you can spend hours downloading it but it doesn‚Äôt even open, just crashes! wonderful isn‚Äôt it?)",1
"I started playing this game nearly a week ago and I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE love it so much. The graphics, the story. It‚Äôs all so amazing. I‚Äôve never seen a better RPG combat game. It‚Äôs so amazing that when you put your mind to work or together you can create a game like this with so many wonderful qualities. I was never really in to combat games before but now I love them. I do have one little edie bitty problem. When I go into Mondstadt it will load every single place in it a bit slow and one time when I was experiencing that problem at the adventurers guild I got stuck into it because it wasn‚Äôt done loading yet. I know that was very dumb you could say but I‚Äôm still young. Overall this is one of the best combat games of 2021 and it came out LAST YEAR. That‚Äôs just my opinion. Anyway, miHOYO keep making these amazing games. I hope to see more from Genshin impact in the future.",5
"i really like this game and play it many hours a day. only when i tried to complete a quest it was a bugged quest. i got a quest not that long ago, ‚Äúthe chi of yore‚Äù and didn‚Äôt start the quest right away. however, the past few days when i have looked at the quest and tried to navigate to the ruins, the navigation thing wouldn‚Äôt show up on the map. today, i looked up a quest guide on how to do it, even though the navigator wouldn‚Äôt show up. i defeated the ruin hunter, found all three fragments near the geo statues, and collected the final chest that was supposed to bring me to the next part of the quest. only it didn‚Äôt. i saw on the quest pop up on the side of the screen it changed the quest to ‚Äúinvestigate the ruins‚Äù for a split second before the pop up changed back to ‚Äúfind all three fragments near the geo statues‚Äù. the quest doesn‚Äôt work at all now, and there‚Äôs still no navigator. not only that but i wanted to continue the new moonlight merriment event only to find out i can‚Äôt until i finish the chi of yore quest because there is a character from the chi of yore quest that is in the moonlight merriment quest. if there‚Äôs something you can do about this please do it. moonlight merriment is a timed event so i would like to complete it before it‚Äôs over. i also know there is a lot of other people with this similar problem. please fix bugged quests.",4
"Okay so aside from this one critique (and it‚Äôs a big one) I love the game and it‚Äôs story... WITH THAT SAID; The adventure rank system and story progression system is WAY TOO NERFED. Instead of having a natural story progression block like just your characters levels and them being too weak, they have an outside Adventure rank level that you have to level up to progress the story... THIS IS HARDER THAN THE STORY. And for why? It literally takes you out of the experience and makes you feel like you‚Äôre doing grueling tasks. Why does it take a full week to unlock a mere 4
20 minutes of gameplay. It forces you to explore the world, which... understandable I guess but what‚Äôs going to be the fun in exploring the world if you‚Äôre forced to just so you can... play the game? 

But... other than that, the story, from what I‚Äôve been able to play, is super immersive. The character design is very well executed, and aside from the one huge overarching punishment for actually doing the story, it feels like the game rewards you in other ways :)",3
"Honestly, I had no idea what to expect going into this game, but I am very impressed with what you can do. It plays like Breath of the Wild, in terms of exploration and item creation, but it also throws in elemental effects and statuses. You acquire different characters through the story, each one with an assigned element and fighting style, and by switching your party members you can create various effects both in combat and on the environment. There‚Äôs a huge area to explore, even if you don‚Äôt work on story quests immediately. The only issue I‚Äôve encountered so far is that it does make my phone overheat if I play too long, and then the game crashes. But you can also play on other formats, so if your phone can‚Äôt hack it, switch to PC or console versions. 

All in all, I definitely recommend this game for anyone who like games with a focus on exploration and experimentation.",5
"I would rate this 0 stars if I could. I have been playing since early 2021, and this game is very fun, but you people need to do better.

The skintone issue is huge in the community, tons of 1 star ratings, people talking about it, and everything all confirms that Hoyoverse does not listen to their fans and supporters. This is such a racist company that it‚Äôs hard to believe. It‚Äôs funny how Hoyoverse makes several nations that are based off of real places and tons of characters, but no diversity. Kaeya and Xinyan aren‚Äôt even dark. I‚Äôve seen WHITE PEOPLE darker than them when tanned. Especially with the Sumeru update, fans and players are very upset about the skintone issues. The fact that the whole archon‚Äôs skin has been compared to a GLOWSTICK and is whiter than it is saying something. And, the fact that the ‚Äútan‚Äù characters in Sumeru are lighter than me as a mostly white person is absolutely crazy. Hoyoverse, actually listen to your fans for once please, and do better. This situation completely proves that you don‚Äôt care about the opinions of your supporters and fans. Do better.",1
"Genshin pls dont redesign scaramouche and listen to us please. NO REDESIGN, NO CHANGE OF PERSONALITY, NO ANEMO VISIOn. My reasons are because we have enough anemo cahracters, and scaramouche is literally a puppet of the ELECTRO archon. I love genshin but hoyoverse you need to stop making the evil bad guys turn into good guys, like seriously why do you have to change his personality its so stupid. Please listen to us, please dont make him enemo it would be nice to have a male electro catalyst. Also it wiuld be nice if you could keep scaramouche‚Äôs hat, im fine with the veil removal but the hat really adds to his character and shouldnt be removed. Personally i think scaramouche does not need a redesign but I assume you think otherwise. I hope you take notice from this review. Overall I think this game could be a 4* but because of how you design and will design future characters I decided to make it 3*. One more thing please stop making all of the characters and most NPCS white, it doesnt add diversity to the game. Thank you and have a great day!",3
"In all honesty, this game is amazing. Genshin Impact was a favorite of mine for almost an entire year, I joined in April 28th of last year. And the first 7-8 months were amazing. But, almost 2 months ago, the game has felt more like a chore then just something you can do in your free time. I haven‚Äôt played at all. There have been times when I did log in but it was all because of curiosity. And I only spent 15-20 minutes online. The last time I‚Äôve been on was a whole 2 weeks ago. If there was just a change in the daily commissions so they could be quicker but at the same time a fun activity to do while your bored, then it would be nice. Another thing, is that with the artifacts, it is SO hard to get something remotely okay for a character. If they could fix it to make it a little easier, it would be amazing.",5
"I know this is going to sound crazy but I have never played any game like how I have played Genshin Impact before. It‚Äôs so evolved that my approach to game playthrough, play style and strategy for an action rpg have completely changed. I have never set goals like this for a game where it gives you an actual sense of accomplishment for achieving something while still keeping the progressive difficulty realistic enough to keep things spicy. It‚Äôs difficult to put down because once you download it and start to get a grip on things you end up unlocking ANOTHER neat feature that adds to the depth and dynamism of the world of Teyvat. Even if you don‚Äôt fully experience immersion like when reading or listening to something this experience will grip you into something comparable to Infinite Tsukiyomi; a blissful world of beauty  and danger in your wildest anime dreams.",5
"This game is all about exploration and elemental combat. The story is creative and the characters have a ton of charm and detail.  Towards the end you have to use limited resources to farm dungeons for better equipment for your characters. Rewards daily play, so despite the gacha system the most beneficial thing you can do for your account is play frequently. Gacha system requires saving game currency diligently or spending real money to get the best characters with the best designs, abilities, and damage potential.  I have been playing since day 1 and have invested tons of time into the game. I haven‚Äôt spent much money since they give out game currency in events.  I have amassed a lot of good characters due only to my time investment.  New players will have a harder uphill climb to endgame content due to their lack of time investment.  Amazing game, A+. The art is insane.",5
"At first when I heard of Genshin Impact I wasn‚Äôt that interested. But as time went on I started to see it everywhere. For me I‚Äôm not really interested in games that have continuous levels where you do the same thing. So when I found out about Genshin Impact I was honestly super happy. It had a great story, beautiful scenery, unique characters, and many events to take part in. When I start a new game I usually stop playing it within 3 weeks. I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since February and I still haven‚Äôt stopped. And my most favorite part is the characters. They‚Äôre so unique and strong in their own way. I love experimenting and playing around with all the characters and using them to fight enemies. And may I just say Liyue is probably another thing I love about Genshin Impact. It‚Äôs so pretty and I love the whole vibe. It‚Äôs a great game I recommend it to everybody.",5
"For a game that‚Äôs free to play I would 100% recommend. The storyline is well written, and flows greatly with the scenery and characters. The amount of playable characters that were written have been done so well! The amount of descriptions for each, and the immense details that have gone into their outfits amaze me. As an artist it makes me quite jealous. It takes up quite a bit of storage, but it‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt have a PlayStation or PC to play on. For a game that you can play on the phone/tablet, the graphics are wonderful. The Gacha feature can be troubling to understand and deal with for those that really want that 5 star character, but I do hope they come home! If anything is confusing just know that there are plenty of people willing to help you out, log into co-op after reaching AR16 and get to beating those bosses! Have fun traveling!",5
I have been playing for a year and the banners on this game are terrible! They pry on the addiction of people and have terrible rates. If you are down to spend $400 dollars in order to get the 5* you are after that is what this game truly offers. I had hope that they might make an anniversary banner that would have something better in terms of rates which like every other gacha game does. However to my disappointment they fed us a cheaper version of a previous event which was also not that great in my own opinion. Not only the banners are terrible but once you get to the end of the content the game dries up hard. The required daily tasks are too much for very little reward. In average just I found in one month doing the daily tasks will only reward you a single 10 pull on any banner and 5 pulls on standard banner. If it is your first time playing this game enjoy the open world and story but I highly recommend to protect your wallets while playing this game.,2
"Let me first say that I love this game and it‚Äôs art style, characters and mechanics. However I‚Äôve put hundreds of dollars and grinder for hours and hours over the span of months and have only achieved 3 five star characters. I understand it is a random drawing with low odds, but wow the amount of disappointment ive had considering the time and money ive put in this game is astounding and frustrating. Also there‚Äôs been an issue in this update where the character switching mechanic does not respond either at all or very very delayed to the point I‚Äôve lost domains and challenges because the buttons will be frozen or I get a ‚Äúcan‚Äôt switch character in cool down‚Äù when in fact, I have not been able to switch my character for 60 seconds. I feel like I get an issue similar to this almost every month now. Anyway, overall a great and beautiful game but I‚Äôm beginning to feel that it‚Äôs not gonna be worth my time or money for a while",3
"I could go on for hours, No. Days, about how amazing and fun this game is there is the graphics, everything but... I do have two problems first problem, Cutscenes during the cutscenes my tablet glitches and the cutscene freezes and I can hear it but I can‚Äôt see it like the very first cutscene where you choose if you want to be the male or female it froze and it only worked when I chose the name and gender, so that‚Äôs the first problem. Here is the second problem, When I‚Äôm in the middle of battles my game freezes and then kicks me out, Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm fighting a Hilichurl camp I get halfway through and I have like two Hilichurls left then my game freezes I get kicked out I go back to the game I have to go through the start screen again and I have to fight the entire Hilichurl camp AGAIN... Well those are my two problems other than that, the game is great and I definitely recommend.",4
"I recently started playing Genshin a few months ago and I love how there is so much to do !! I‚Äôm currently AR 49 and I enjoy fighting in the domains and defeating bosses. 

However, I wish that there was another way to earn more primogems faster for F2P players. I understand there are daily commissions and new upcoming events that distribute some primos when you partake in them, but it is only enough for a few wish pulls.

A 5 star character is guaranteed when you reach 90 pity on a banner, and a lot of primogems are required in order to reach that number. If you have Bennett‚Äôs luck, (like me), it is really difficult to obtain new 5 star characters when you only get one every 80-90 wishes.

It would be nice if the developers can increase the amount of primogems us F2P players get so we have the opportunity to have as many new 5 stars as possible (or at least lower the guaranteed 5 star rate chance when wishing).

Other than that, the graphics are so beautiful and I love how there is little to no lag as a mobile player. Although this game does take up a lot of storage, it‚Äôs really worth it.

Overall, I definitely enjoy everything Genshin has to offer and I am looking forward to more updates in the future !! 

Thank you so much MiHoYo for developing such a wonderful game ! ‚≠êÔ∏è",5
"Overall Genshin impact is a really great game the graphics are great and it makes me feel as if I‚Äôm actually in the anime/game. I totally recommend the game, my only complaint is that I have know idea how to get wishes. I‚Äôm knee to the game so if anyone has any tips or ideas that would be more than helpful I rated the game 5 stars it might seem like a little to much but it‚Äôs a really great game it gets updates often and you can tell they took a lot of time and effort in to the game. All I‚Äôm asking is to give it a try. I‚Äôm addicted after having the game for about a week but I‚Äôm not that far it can be challenging but I‚Äôm starting to get better over time. I think for the amount of time put into it, it deserves 5 stars for sure.  Something that makes this anime rpg even better is the game is totally free there is in app purchases. It‚Äôs an amazing game! Thank you for reading this or maybe even giving it a shot!üòÑ",5
"This is so frustrating and disappointing. I got this game thinking it would be similar to another game that I like, and was really looking forward to playing it, and after multiple hours waiting for it to download and then to download all of the data required for a complete game, I started the game. The first time I tried it, I got into the game, but only managed to view the first scene with the crab and the sand before the game kicked me out. I tried again and again, but I never made it past that scene, and eventually I thought that maybe it would help to uninstall and reinstall the game which took another hour and a half, and gave me the same result. Now, I can‚Äôt actually judge the game itself, since I NEVER GOT TO PLAY IT, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs super fun, which is why I‚Äôm giving it two stars instead of one. The art (so far) was beautiful and if I actually got to play it, I‚Äôm sure I would like it a lot. I‚Äôm also going to reboot my phone this evening to see if that helps, but it‚Äôs still super disappointing. I hope other people have more luck than I did.",2
"I usually never review apps or games of anything but wow, this game is SO AMAZING! And FREE!? I have always wanted to try and find a good, open-world RPG for mobile and came close to a few good ones but never one like this that hits the nail directly on the head! Countless hours of gameplay, good story, lush open-world, and BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS! And again... completely FREE! Overall this game is so good, I would easily pay $15-$20 for it after knowing what I know about how good it is. The one thing that would really be the cherry on top of this deliciously crafted masterpiece, is if it were to have controller compatibilities. I know it‚Äôs still early on and still in the process of being fully developed and tweaked but, if later on down the road you could use a controller to play; that would make this the %100 best game I‚Äôve ever played on a mobile device. So please, in the future, maybe try to find a way to make that happen! :) A+++",5
"I have been playing this game for over two years now, and I‚Äôve stuck through it with every single update. Until this recent one. My iPhone only has 64GB of storage, and when each update is like 3GB+, I always have to delete a lot of my other apps to make room for this one. But this update especially, even after I deleted 10+ apps, photos, text messages, and everything you can name, the game still told me I had insufficient storage. I seriously love the game and I have spent a good amount of money on it, but I just really can‚Äôt continue regularly playing it anymore (since my laptop isn‚Äôt good enough to run the game), and I‚Äôm seriously really sad. I really hope that Hoyoverse can fix this issue soon, because Lantern Rite especially is my favorite annual update and I don‚Äôt want to not play this game anymore because of a storage problem.",4
"it‚Äôs making me a hard to play the game when I just start playing it with the bug just standing there in the dark of the thing of the surface I can‚Äôt see it but it‚Äôs hurting my surface you need to fix the gigabytes because every time I play the game my phone dies really quickly and it gets really hot for some reason fix that please in the darkest green lid always log me off in and the game I know this sounds like a cookie plate but it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs actually true because I start playing the game just yesterday and is still really weird does it work for iPhones I feel like
fix the bug please I‚Äôll be better off so I could get a game very safely :3 cause I can‚Äôt see anything in the game I guess  a dark screen The quality is good but you need to fix the bug thank you for listening to my comment it‚Äôs not a complaint please don‚Äôt think that",5
"This game is fun as I play it on my PC a lot. However when I take it to the mobile experience it is actually unplayable. I downloaded it on the iPad 5 generation which is well capable enough to run it, however it doesn‚Äôt work well. The download process is smooth, but the screen is just black in most places where color would otherwise be. In game, aside from constantly crashing, you actually can see in a small radius, but anything far away is just covered by the black screen. This radius doesn‚Äôt redeem it though because in fights, like the ones with storm terror for instance, you literally can‚Äôt see anything and the entire screen is black aside from icons. The same goes for dungeons as well. I really hope Mihoyo fixes this because my iPad is easily capable of running this even if it does have to be on the lowest settings. I don‚Äôt feel the need to buy a new iPad to play a game with a bug that can be fixed. This same problem is on my iPhone 6 as well.",3
"Genshin Impact is the best game I‚Äôve ever played in my phone, it‚Äôs graphics are astounding for a mobile game, the sound effects are high quality and, unlike most games, the voice actors are impeccable. The story so far is looking promising, and the game plays very smoothly, and on top of that it‚Äôs very fun, whereas with other mobile games I give up out of boredom, but with this I just want to play more and more of the game. All of the characters are different in their own ways, each of them unique and lovable, keeping you engaged with them. The only flaw I see with this game is that I don‚Äôt find an actually difficult fight often, but when I do it‚Äôs really fun. Overall, great job to all of the people who worked on this and to those who helped make this possible, keep up the amazing work, and don‚Äôt stop what you‚Äôre doing now!",5
"I KNOW, we ALL know that this company does not care about their fan base at all unless it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgame removal risk‚Äù. During the first anniversary, it was proven that they‚Äôll only listen to their fan base if their game it at risk to be removed from the App Store with the negative review bombing that occurred. 

One of the most anticipated characters, who happened to have the slightest hit of melanin (news flash she isn‚Äôt even that dark, unfortunately) is treated HORRIBLY when it comes to how her play style works and how much damage she‚Äôll do. A content creator sent them a message about a bug (the ‚Äòbug‚Äô being that her ultimate attack being cancelled if you jump), and want to know their response? ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt jump during her burst‚Äù (burst = ultimate attack). 

Really? That‚Äôs their response? If so many people are complaining about something, FIX it. Especially for something like this. Hoyoverse, the company, only listen to Chinese servers and players which is honestly terrible because a handful group of players shouldn‚Äôt be the reason why some things happen or not.",1
"As an avid breath of the wild player I was so hesitant to play this game, as I'd heard so much controversy. It looked SOOOO similar, but when I picked it up on pc to play it for myself, I can definitely say the devs played botw, then decided to make their own game using the same assets and a semi-different main plot. As you play more, though, you can see how they've grown into their own separate universe, and how they've molded into their own specific game; and not just an anime botw.
You can see and appreciate the changes they've made to go out of their way to say, ""Hey, just because we used another game for inspiration doesn't mean we're a bad game."" It's not a bad game at all, and it's got a lot of inspiration from other games as well, such as WoW. It's got blatant inspiration, yes, but ultimately it's not a ripoff of any game. Highly recommend, but play it on pc. The fact that it's free boggles my mind.",4
"Genshin Impact is very addicting i‚Äôll admit but there are so many things you should add for one,, You guys should make it so its easier to get primogems for ar‚Äôs 30-60 im ar 50 and i find it very hard to farm for primos. Maybe, when people get to AR 45 the amount of primogems you get for commissions can increase? And same thing for chests. I just think it‚Äôd make it a lot easier to farm !! Also I sort of find this game boring,, from time to time,, To make the game way more fun maybe you can add a few more commissions but more fun!! for example some commissions in the pot, ones where its not just fighting, and whatever you guys can come up with!! And for quests I started to tell its usually just dialogue so maybe add some more fighting, puzzles, and fun things but the main problem for me is how hard it is to get primos. so try to improve it and i think the game will be a lot more fun",4
"Now despite the title I‚Äôm not entirely sad I‚Äôve lost so much money to this game. It has great characters with fun fighting techniques, though a new weapon type would be nice. The issue is that I had to spend so much just to get 5 star characters. Due to how little primogems are given and how hard it is to get to pity. If the pity system was a little better I think the game would be much better. They‚Äôd still get my money because then I could actually get constellations and pay for college. Please Hoyoverse, make your summoning system a little easier or primogems easier to obtain. Been playing since day one working hard on events and whatnot, it is tough to be able to get characters you want. But let me remind you m, great characters, great story, fun open world and tons more content to come. I‚Äôm optimistic about the future of the game and hopefully the developers listening to their community more!",4
It‚Äôs such an awesome game I have it on my PlayStation amazing but the world quest like ‚ÄúThe Chi of Yore‚Äù I have to search the vault I defeated one of the big ones I have to defeat 5 of them during the second round when more enemies come three spawned in bro how am I supposed to defeat them all three against one for the big guys that‚Äôs just not cool it makes the game terrible most of my characters are at a higher level but that still doesn‚Äôt work all of them end up dying and I can‚Äôt even finish the quest same thing for winter or snow mountain thing I can‚Äôt do anything without freezing sometimes I find a warm spot but I can‚Äôt stay there cause the monsters go back to their spot where I find them then I have to start all over again it‚Äôs a good game it just don‚Äôt make sense on some parts I can‚Äôt defeat three big guys just like that ü§¶,5
"for genshin to incorporate different real life cultures and regions into their game, you‚Äôd be surprised that the characters from sumeru were even from there at all. sumeru is supposed to be based off of the SWANA region, and while, yes, it‚Äôs not supposed to be mirror images of one another, asking for skintone representation with this new in game region shouldn‚Äôt even have to be an ask- it should have been implemented from the get go.

but alas, out of all the characters that have been leaked for sumeru 3.0, only ONE character is of a darker complexion, and she‚Äôs rumored to be a 4 star. you have 50 playable characters and only 2 are of darker complexion. there are also 0 five star characters of tan-darker complexions.

i‚Äôve spent over $3,000 in this game alone, but sumeru is where i draw the line. as someone with darker skin, seeing a middle eastern inspired region have most characters literally neon white is a slap in the face to me and others too. skintone representation is not just a western issue. people all over the world have all sorts of skintones, it‚Äôs high time hoyoverse starts incorporating them into genshin impact.",1
"I got this game when it first came out but then I got stuck on a mission and just RAGE QUIT (¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂‡ΩºœÅ‡ºé‡∫∂‡Ωº`). Then my friend * cough * crush *cough* got it and said she would help me with it and SHES IN LOVE WITH IT TOO \(//‚àá//)\ . I honestly love it and can‚Äôt stop playing I never have problems and like open world games I NEED MORE _:(¬¥‡ΩÄ`„Äç ‚à†): . I have stickers on my walls , water bottles and in my school desk ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞).

Are you kidding all games have adds but nope not this one . Only on complaint it‚Äôs a LOT of money to pay for something and hard to get stuff to do the pulls ig that‚Äôs what they are called idk . Also loading in takes forever. And then there level 16 thing I HAVE TO WAIT ughhhhh. BUT THERES my boi dulic (//‚àá//) We need more charters as ‚Ä¶ No ‚Ä¶. like him.

"I started this game from launch and it is by no means perfect. Time gated content, bad end game loop, slow resin regeneration, and more. They are all valid issues but one thing comes to mind. What other mobile game has this good of graphics, story, and gameplay? None that‚Äôs what. If you rush your progress in this game you will run out of things to do, but why rush? This incredible open world RPG is the best on the App Store. And yes just because there is gacha systems this doesn't mean you have to spend money to win at the game. I‚Äôve never dropped a single dollar on this game and have had average luck on pulls and I‚Äôm still beating the hardest content in the game. I recommend to give this game a try if you have 30 minute down times here and there. It‚Äôs definitely not a game to play for 5 minutes like some other mobile games. 

Best wishes,
Mondstat Traveler",5
"Hello Mihoyo, I believe this game of yours is truly fascinating and really addicting. Now, in the game there are many places to transport and I am really grateful for that. But, there are a bit of commissions at dawn winery and it can be a bit of a challenge sometimes to get there with such quests such as the food delivery. And i get it! It's supposed to be challenging yes, but I think it might be a bit difficult for new players since their stamina wouldn't be as high as a AR. 50 player. And to get to the winery from the statue is a bit far for them. So I was wondering if you could add a teleport waypoint a bit closer to dawn winery but not exactly at it. Like maybe on the cliff behind the winery. That would help with the slime commissions too. Then it's a win-win for everyone. That's just my opinion though, at least think about it if you want. Other than that, great job with your game!",5
"Best game to play across many platforms, and it‚Äôs quite an enjoyment for its story, characters and it‚Äôs gotcha system. You can still enjoy the game in full without paying a single dollar, and you can also enjoy the game with buying in game currency to boost your playing time with getting stronger 5 star characters and what not. But you can still get them doing the old fashion grinding for Primogems and save up for the chance of getting one of the weapons or characters you want. 100% of the game is accessible for free to play players. You don‚Äôt have to buy anything to even enjoy the newest events. 
*Right now there‚Äôs people rating this game a 1 star due to not being happy with the anniversary gift from Mihoyo, which I find their actions very petty* I‚Äôm a semi P2P for their characters, but I‚Äôm not mad about the gifts. They could‚Äôve just not even do the event*",5
I love this game it‚Äôs one of my favorite games but the thing is when inazuma came out I didn‚Äôt know how to get there I was gonna use keayas ice bridge. But then I realized that it was an archon quest I was kinda up set because I still can‚Äôt complete the we will be reunited quest I was gonna try but I think it‚Äôs a little to extreme because you have to fight four hilichurls two have a cross bow while the Ofer two I think have clubs of just use there hands and the you also have to kill two abyss mages and one ruin hunter and I got upset because every time I try to finish it I always die I have been trying get better builds leveling up but still I think it‚Äôs a little to hard and I don‚Äôt know why inazuma has to be and archon quest because monstadt wasn‚Äôt lyiue wasn‚Äôt so  I really don‚Äôt understand why inazuma is :/,5
The game is great but I‚Äôm currently stuck on the world quest trials and tranquility or whatever it was called. I‚Äôm almost finished with it I‚Äôm on the last stage and I would love for someone to help me out but I can‚Äôt because I have to complete the quest before having people in my world are joining other peoples worlds. as for the characters I mean mean and because you give your character so low when it‚Äôs time for a new character or there was like a three hour crash route three day crash. I am currently meaning traveler Bennett Lisa and Amber and sometimes BarbaraFor me it‚Äôs impossible to defeat five enemies within 60 seconds because one of them trying to drowned me the other ones have been frozen for one second and I was at a 10 second mark and I had a bit of how to left on the abyss mates but because it trapped me in a bubble for five seconds I couldn‚Äôt kill it and this repeat it on for three hours.,4
"This game gives off vibes that remind me of Breath of the Wild. And for a company that makes mobile games to do that.....outstanding. I do have some things I would like added or changed. Most importantly, I want to be able to pet the cats and dogs. They follow you around for a short while and all you can really do is...run around in a circle around them. I would also like it if there was a dodge mechanic in the game and not just dashing. I also think when you level up, overtime, the quests, commissions leylines, and all that stuff give you should give you more EXP. But thats about it. Amazing game.
Quick update
I no longer play this game on mobile, I instead play on PS4 (PS5 when it‚Äôs released on the console). I do prefer to play on consoles 100% of the time. Just a quick update that‚Äôs all. Still great game",5
"My friends and I were talking and one of them told me to download this game. I looked at it, thought it looked sub par at best, like DDLC visual novel graphics, but 3D, which are good graphics, just not animated, as I thought this should be, but I downloaded it anyway, because my friend was often right about good games. I WAS BLOWN AWAY. The graphics are amazing, the voice acting is good, the game mechanics make me want to cry with how perfect they are, and the characters, even the npcs that never have any big impact are so well written that I almost felt bad for Timmie after using MCs  on his pigeons accidentally, no mad he made me any other time. I‚Äôve been playing it everyday, and the story made me cry, it WAS SO EMOTIONALLY CHARGED. Also, I‚Äôve gotten obsessed with cooking every dish the game had to offer, because they sound amazing.
Download this game, you will never regret it.",5
"Once you get started up it‚Äôs pretty fun, the motive of the game is to defeat monsters, complete quests, participate in events, and get new characters in this vast open world of Tevyat. There is a large number of places you can go to and explore, you can teleport to them once you‚Äôve unlocked waypoints and statues. The statues heal you once you‚Äôre injured. For me personally, this game is very fun for exploring, getting characters, saving for the characters, and getting all the items you need for them! You can spend money on this game but I assure you, you‚Äôll do just fine without money with enough experience and skill. The most you can spend n this game is about a month learning to get the basics down, at least for me that is. I totally recommend it if you like open world exploration, quests, frequent events, and new characters every update!",5
OMG when I first got this game I was like no way it‚Äôll be that frickin good but after like one day i fell in love with it. I only have one problem honestly because when you are wishing for a five star and finally see the gold streak you‚Äôre like Omygod I got it YAZ FINALLY then the character shows up and its one of lesser quality not quality really but one that you did not want. I still remember wishing for Xiao and getting Diluc I spent three weeks wishing when i could have been swimming in my grnparents pool and got fricking Diluc! My god i wanted to destroy my phone. Other than that minor detail I loved this game. Unfortunately I had to delete it after a certain amount of time because it was all i would do all day like to an unhealthy amount. But anyway thx for hearing me out Mihoyo you guys have created and amazing game! - Aspect-tignari main,5
"Hi there. Day 1 player here. The recent announcement of no engame content has left me baffled at how disrespectful this company is to the people who supported it the most. Ive spent 2k plus on this game for characters that now i realize i never needed. Grinded away to level characters that now never even mattered. Why did i pay for all these things i will never really be able to explore to full depth? Why would anyone spend money on constellations if you dont even need them for any of the content? I have so much anxiety over the fact that i wont get to use the things i spent money on to the fullest extent. Its disgusting. So much of my life wasted because you wont just give us harder content. This game is going to die and you have noone to blame but yourselves. Keep pandering to your player base that doesnt spend money on the game and watch how that affects your investors. Dumbest marketing decision i have ever seen a company make. ‚ÄúHere lets not give the people who support us the most anything thats actually fun to do, should work out great!‚Äù Idiots. Absolute idiots.",1
"Overall, Genshin impact is great. The graphics and the sound are amazing, the characters are really well thought out and planned and the quests (for the most part) are interesting. 

But I do have some genuine concerns. It isn‚Äôt MacOS friendly, the quests are originally long for veteran players and then are cut in half for new players, and if you take a break from Genshin you will miss a lot of things. I took a break before after Inazuma. When I first started in Inazuma I was overwhelmed with the quests. I was desperately trying to catch up with the fog island and other islands. I still haven‚Äôt unlocked Enkanomiya. I was getting bored of doing the same exploring, trying to max out explorations, collecting offerings to the god of the region,  finishing off quests to unlock more new levels to explore, and a similar character design for new characters. 

It also made people who played mobile switch to pc because of the amount of storage needed. I am Ar 55 and I have been playing since last march. Over time my experience has switched from ‚Äú Oh this is so fun! I love playing this. It‚Äôs so fun.‚Äù to a ‚ÄúI have to do this. I have to do this otherwise I‚Äôll miss ___. This quest is so long, I just want to go to *new region*‚Äù

I love this game. It‚Äôs a beautiful game with a beautiful story behind it. The game feels like it‚Äôs  on a slow decline. I want to be able to start playing again. 

Thank you",3
"I‚Äôve been a console gamer/PC gamer my whole life. Occasion mobile gaming on early iOS like fruit ninja/angry birds era but never thought I‚Äôd actually enjoy mobile game until I got my Backbone for my iPhone 12 Pro and downloaded Genshin Impact. It runs really smoothly BUT I would love to see better optimization for the graphics on iOS cause my iPhone is a hot brick after running the game for an hour (granted I like running it on all low graphic settings except medium render and 60 FPS). After about 1.5 hours to 2 hours you definitely start getting lag. Also would be awesome if they included dual touch and controller features in the mobile version as opposed to choosing one or the other, like what Backbone has in their platform iOS app. Otherwise, been having a blast playing coop cross platform with my friends on PS5, which I‚Äôd never thought possible as a longtime gamer.",4
The games really good and I enjoy playing it a lot but it‚Äôs to big and I can‚Äôt play it because I don‚Äôt have enough room to update it because it‚Äôs to big but I do enjoy playing it it‚Äôs the game I play the most but the updates keep making the game bigger and bigger I‚Äôm not trying to be rude or anything but I‚Äôm Also asking if you can make the updates take less room on the iPad so if you could that would be great but I do understand if that‚Äôs to hard and not possible but I‚Äôm just asking. The game is my favorite game I I do want to keep playing it I just can‚Äôt update it intill I get more storage so I‚Äôm just asking if you could try to make the updates take less room I just hope that they take less room to keep playing it. That‚Äôs all I have to say but just a reminder I‚Äôm not trying to offend or be rude to anyone or anybody if that‚Äôs how you feel.,4
"I jus cannot describe how amazing this game is. The graphics and resolution are awesome and the gameplay itself is incredible! I just cannot get tired of this game as I do in every other one. Though I have to say one thing. Whenever I arrive at the entrance of Mondstat or at any other entrance place the game leaves by itself, and I need to reopen it and wait for it all to load again. I particularly don‚Äôt really care about that, but it‚Äôs a little annoying every time I arrive some place worrying about the game closing up and immediately get back to it again. This problem might not have a solution, because it can just be the iPhone that closes the game by whatever reason. But if you have any solutions I‚Äôll be happy to try them out m, and if you don‚Äôt that‚Äôs totally fine, I can handle these closings just fine. 
Other than that, this game is absolutely incredible, great job at it all!!!",5
"I have to admit, at first I thought this was going to be some cheasy, super hero/anime game. But this game is soooo much better than I thought! I've been playing this game for months now and its now my favorite app on the phone. I think the graphics are so detailed, and each character is made so finely and they each have their own special way. I love the voice-acting and the story line whenever you have a quest, and also that you ALWAYS have either a quest, or a commision, or some battling to do, so you're always active in the game. The only problem is, the game always keeps crashing, although it doesn't really affect the gameplay. Also, for some reason Mihoyo signed me out of the game, and when I tried to log back in it kept on saying that the password/username were incorrect, so I had to lose all of my progress and make a new accountDX But otherwise, this game is literally the best game!!!",5
Love the game bought prob $200 total of welking way worth it and much more on normal but def does not have to pay to play it‚Äôs just easier to pay to play but this game is amazing I just wish that the rates on artifacts were better cause I still cannot get a good circlet to replace my current one but like ABSOLUTLY RECOMMEND not only is it an amazing story but I absolutely love the character design and everything I‚Äôm a hu Tao/ Ayaka main and do not regret triple crowning either of them def worth playing if your looking for a long term game that has a amazing story that is not completed so you have something to look forward to! New update looks bomb cannot wait to see it (talking abt 3.5) my bf and other friends play and we all could agree! Can I win my 50/50 on shenhe banner hoyoverse? Pleaseeeeeeee I am on a winning streak rn üôèüôèüôè,5
"This is literally so addicting. The graphic quality and character designs are so great. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the storyline, it‚Äôs just so entertaining and exciting to progress more and more into the game through the quests and everything. So far I haven‚Äôt seen any bugs that have annoyed me, I would recommend this game to people. It has so many interesting feats and stuff. Even if I don‚Äôt have any quests to do, there‚Äôs always something to do that is just as entertaining. I love the creativity of the storyline and the bosses, is just so exciting. Thank you for creating this game, it has kept me occupied and entertained everyday. I would just like to recommend an update choice. I‚Äôd honestly love if there was an ability to pet and interact with the dogs and cats that are spread throughout the map. They‚Äôre just so cute and hard to resist.",5
"As a free to play player, I‚Äôve been with this game for 5 months now. I love it, used all my free time just to explore and farm and roam around. Sometimes I get bored, but that didn‚Äôt stop me from playing. This game has a co-op mode, which allows players to travel to other player‚Äôs world as well. I love to help out new comers and whoever needs help. It was fun making friends all around Genshin. So many new contents coming out, I‚Äôm so excited, not just for the content but the amount of free primogems that HoYoLAB gives us. As a f2p, I love free primogems. I log on, do daily works then explore. Trust me, if you are bored, feel free to join other‚Äôs world and explore. There are so many ways to earn primogems and the fact that I lose every 50/50 makes primogems even more important. Don‚Äôt mind the fact that I spend 6 hours a day on this game. I love it, it‚Äôs very addicting.",5
"This game is beautiful in almost every aspect! The visuals are absolutely stunning and the lore is very well written. My favorite part of this game is listening to the amazing soundtrack, which is capable of evoking many emotions. Also, fighting style of the game is quite fun and easy to understand. This game has gotten some bad reviews from players who wanted better chances with the gacha system, however, it‚Äôs important to consider that this is one of the only ways for the company to make some profit. There were also many complaints about poor anniversary rewards, but I don‚Äôt think that will lessen your playing experience with the game. The download and update time may take longer than other games, but it will all be worth it in the end. Hopefully this review will persuade you to download the game. If it did, then happy playing, Traveler!",5
"Genshin Impact is a fun and addicting game, you could possibly spend hours on it if you have the time. The storyline is also well written and I‚Äôve spent almost 2 years playing it, so it does have a ton to offer but the lack of skin diversity is sad. With Sumeru coming out I was hoping they wouldn‚Äôt continue to white wash their characters but I expected too much from Hoyoverse. Having the new Sumeru characters based on real tanned/dark skinned historical figures (as I‚Äôve heard) and be incredibly disrespectful to take high inspiration from them, yet not give the characters the correct skin tones shows a lot about the company already. I love this game and have spent a good amount on it too, but I‚Äôve chosen to stop giving them money (and to those continuing to spend I‚Äôd urge you to also stop). This game is near and dear to my heart but it‚Äôs frustrating to see Hoyoverse coming out with regions that have people with tanned/dark skin and white wash the characters even after multiple complaints from their own community of players.",2
"I love genshin impact a lot. I absolutely love the deep lore and interesting characters there are. But honestly, grinding for primogems in late game is literally impossible. I have near 100 percent exploration everywhere. I have done every single quest, hangout event, etc. the only way I get a significant amount of primogems is by buying welkin and doing commissions. There definitely needs to be more generous rewards in things like spiral abyss. It‚Äôs really annoying that you only get 2,400 primogems IF you 36 star the abyss. However most people do not. And for context, 2,400 primogems gets you ONLY 15 wishes. It‚Äôs a very underwhelming reward for such a hard task. And pity levels in wishing are something else completely. It seems really disgusting that 90 is the max pity but we barely get enough primogems for A SINGLE WISH WITH COMISSIONS ALONE. If you relied on daily commissions only for primogems, then it would take you 4 DAYS TO EVEN AFFORD A SINGLE WISH. It‚Äôs really disheartening to see such a great game become dead because of the lack of proper rewards. So please provide better increased rewards   :(",1
"The game itself is pretty and it can be fun for a while but coming from an AR 57 player it falls off hard every day I log on to use resin and all I get is disappointment I farmed artifacts for a good 4 months and still barely got anything worth using. The resin problem has been stated time and time again but they DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR COMMUNITY. I‚Äôm honestly at the point where I don‚Äôt want to log on anymore but I‚Äôve spent a good amount of money into this game so now I just feel obligated to play. I keep expecting more from the game I know I shouldn‚Äôt because of how the company is but I really just want to believe, the game could just be SO MUCH BETTER if they‚Äôd listen to their community but it‚Äôs like they just refuse to listen like with the anniversary rewards my expectations were low but how did they still manage to crush expectations even more, do they not realize how large their community is or something? They‚Äôre just asking for people to quit at this point and honestly I hope a bunch of players quit maybe they‚Äôd get a wake up call.",1
"Thank you so much miHoYo for such the BEST anniversary ever! We having such a good time together! I really do find interesting in this game and you‚Äôre doing great about it! The stories , music, characters design, everything is so perfect that this game become a part of me! I spent time and effort and sometime even money for new banners for hopefully helping you create more content and growing your game! This really hurt me a lot when you answer my effort and my time by giving me and the community who really participating in this game a 10 pulls for 7 days and a event I have to found a chest for primos! And you call it a 1 year anniversary! What do you want me to do with those primos? 10 pulls could give me a 4 star character and OK that‚Äôs fine but still not worth! But for real ? You can‚Äôt be more generous to give us some more? So we can have something to celebrate, to have something that keep we want to play this game more! To have a reason to stay in this game! Or at lease tell me why or the reason behind or any explanation why the reward this bad! Please please please miHoYo!!!!!!",1
"The couple recent characters that have been released so far (Yoimiya, Raiden Shogun, Sara, and probably more to come) have been underwhelming in terms of their performance and kit design. This is displayed in the case of the Raiden Shogun, who‚Äôs the most hyped character with the new release of the Inazuma region. Her base form at C0 performs terribly compared to other characters within the same element and support role, but becomes viable at C2, which requires players to pull more, resulting in more spending. On the same topic of elements, she is one of the weakest elements in the game, which is electro, which deserves a buff to compete with the top elements. Past characters felt good at C0, and didn‚Äôt require further investment to compete those of the same role, but that has changed in the case of the Raiden Shogun. I do not think that it was a coincidence that a top up bonus reset was aligned with the character‚Äôs release, as if Mihoyo knew that the Raiden Shogun would encourage players to spend even more. This is bad practice overall for the players, especially for F2P and low spenders.",1
"I love Genshin Impact, for too many reasons to count, and I feel that it‚Äôs truly a good game, but with patience. A lot of this game is waiting, waiting for the daily commissions (quests) to reset, waiting for bosses to reset, etc. It‚Äôs not easy to get started on this game when you don‚Äôt have the patience to grind out your adventure rank (player level) and complete long, convoluted quests. I find that playing the game casually is the best way to get started, as opposed to sitting down and doing every single quest and storyline available in a day. Saving Primogems, which allow you to roll for new characters, is also very prevalent if you aren‚Äôt just playing casually or you really really want a specific character. I would recommend not spending primogems at all until a desirable character like Bennett or Sucrose is on a banner to get you started with another four star character.",4
"Honestly ahead of its time. Super smooth gameplay on mobile (as well as on PC - i like to switch between the two). I usually like mmos, rpgs, action/adventure so this ticks allll the boxes for me. The gameplay itself is really fun, and even if you don‚Äôt want to spend a dime, the free characters are plenty. But to be honest, after you‚Äôve spend a dozen hours, what‚Äôs a 5$ monthly card? People are willing to pay 10-20$ for a 2h movie, so spending 5$ a month on extra fun spread across many more hours is definitely justified. Afterall, people creating this game arent volunteering. But that 5$ is absolutely not necessary. I like the game enough to put money on it - but I only did that after I had sunken an easy 30h+ on it. No money? No problem. Fun & some to spare? A bit of extra fun so why not. 
Bit of coop for dungeons, loads of story quests, events & gorgeous graphics!",5
"Most of the 1 Star Reviews are complaints for lag and just saying the game is ‚Äúterrible‚Äù with no reason why. It crashes occasionally for me, but only when I teleport to a town with a lot of graphics to load, the game lags and crashes for people either because their internet cant handle it or their device is out of date. There are also many complaints about it taking up ‚Äútoo much storage‚Äù and using ‚Äútoo much data‚Äù. Genshin Impact is a high quality game, therefore it requires a larger amount than most other mobile games for storage and data. I have also seen complaints saying it takes your money because you have to ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù. I have been playing for 245 hours, and have not spent a single cent, and I have already completed at least 95% of the game. All Im saying is this is a well made and beautiful game.",5
"Firstly I want to start off with primogems. Everyone needs primogems to obtain new characters and weapons. I am having a very hard time obtaining them. However there are quest you can do to get them.. but they are hard. Once you complete a hard quest, you only get at least 20-60 primogems?! Secondly losing a 50/50 to one of the characters from standard banner. I was saving for ayaka I had everything for her, but once I lost 50/50, it got more harder to obtain her. I kept wishing, spending hours, and even becoming a bit antisocial to my friends. This game can become a unhealthy habit of grinding. Sure there are 4 star characters, but spending the money I have spent, I am still not getting the character and if I don‚Äôt or do, I should get my money back. This is unacceptable. It‚Äôs great at the start but once I didn‚Äôt get a character or lose a 50/50 the grind still continues. And everyone is counting on Hoyoverse to create events that you can earn primogems. Im not trying to beg for a character, but my account is kinda weak and without her, I‚Äôll remain weak for god knows how long.",1
"I love Genshin Impact, and have been playing for over a year now. I do sometimes get bored at the end of versions but always come back. The graphics are great, and the character designs visually are stunning. Characters themselves have been a little disappointing as of late, but only when compared to the main damage dealing units. One problem I do have with the game is the storyline. Much of it feels emotionless, and the protagonist always wins so far, making the game feel very much like a Disney show. I think that if the developers made players more connected to them, and made it so that at one point or another, the traveler has to face something different, not just a boss battle, but maybe something more emotional, such as a character in the game dying, and not just super suddenly. Aside from all that, everything about this game is great, and you should definitely give it a try.",4
"First of all, you may see reviews complaining about the devs being racist and not having enough color diversity, this is however only half the story. The game is developed in China which has a racist government and the government is very controlling, because of this it makes it near impossible for the devs to put dark skin characters in the game and the ones they do not being that dark. While it is sad that representation isn‚Äôt present we can‚Äôt fault the devs for that as it‚Äôs not entirely their fault. Over all 9.5/10 game and I highly recommend it but I recommend you play it casually instead of grinding like content creators do. It makes the game more fun to play that way. Also make sure your phone can handle it first. It‚Äôs a very high quality game that older phones may not handle well.",5
I‚Äôve been playing this game for about a year and a half and I honestly can‚Äôt recommend this game to anyone your life would be so much easier without it. Us players have been voicing things that are important to us for the games quality of life that the developers(Hoyoverse) chose to do nothing about while knowing exactly what the issues are they just ignore us and treat us like cash cows even telling players to recommend their game to others on an anniversary we got hardly anything on they absolutely just want our wallets and after spending so much time and money in this game and then hearing they have no plans of improving the game even a little is very upsetting this should be a mutual relationship but this game just leeches off of our money this is a billion dollar company that‚Äôs is acting like they can‚Äôt give us what we want in a game we support with our own money it‚Äôs just ridiculous please fix these problems Hoyoverse I know you hear your upset player loud and clear and I‚Äôm far from the only one to complain.,1
I got into this game a while ago before liyue came out but for a long period of time I didnt know how to do anything as an f2p all I wanted to do was raise my adventure rank which i didnt know how to do either and artifact combinationa and abilities I was clueless to. It was when I got back to the game just after inazuma finished I learned the concept of it. Overall this game is amazing for all people. But for me its like it‚Äôs making pay for not playing for that long because in that entire period of time ive gotten NO 5 stars the first one I got was at 86 pity where I lost the 50/50 of raiden to her. Then in the kazuha rerun banner I stopped being f2p and wasted 5$ on welkin that is when I got kazuha at 87 pity I dont know why some people get 5 stars first try in the first idk 5 pulls but for me getting a 5 star even just weapon is blessing.,5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Genshin Impact is a very beautiful game with very uniquely designed characters! Although, I just have one recommendation to make. What if you guys added trading to the game? Then it would make getting materials easier! I know there is Co-Op mode, but you could also trade weapons, and even characters including four and five stars. But, the catch is that you also need to give the person you‚Äôre trading something. Say, for example, you wanted to trade someone for, let‚Äôs say a weapon, then that means you would also have to give the person you‚Äôre trading with a weapon too. This would also help increase people‚Äôs trust because you can‚Äôt complete the trade unless you also give something to the person you‚Äôre trading with. This is just a suggestion/recommendation, thank you for your time!",5
"Honestly what can I say, Hoyoverse claims to listen and care about what it‚Äôs viewers but that‚Äôs a blatant lie, and instead chooses to listen to the people who agree with the company. It‚Äôs ridiculous and I‚Äôm personally tired of it. Out of the 50 playable character we have only TWO darker skinned characters, them being Kaeya and Xinyan. Every single other one is lighter skinned, as of recent it seems to be it‚Äôll stay like that. What a joke, after the game being released and playable for two years they have yet to any other type of diversity in skin color. Hoyoverse is capable of doing more, there are characters that are inspired by Japanese culture, ( Arataki Itto being my example) they researched the significance of certain parts of his outfit, drawing close detail. Why can they not do the same with adding darker skinned characters? It‚Äôs not a impossible task, they have done it twice, which is the bare minimum. There is darker skinned asians so it‚Äôs not like we are asking for the impossible. 
Overall I‚Äôm upset at the lack of caring Hoyoverse seems to demonstrate. They do not listen to us.",1
"Excellent, immersive gameplay. Frequent updates. Quick and effective hot fixes. Devs respond to feedback. Diverse and unique characters. Only real complaint is the time it takes to update the client from App Store. Perhaps it‚Äôs just my internet but I gotta start the update process at the beginning of my day and watch it to make sure it finishes. Be nice if character switches didn‚Äôt drop characters during Dvalin fight but it‚Äôs not actually hard content.  <INSERT RANT> Nobody really states this but your artifacts basically define which characters you should build. Drop rates are consistent, yes, but stat rolls are horrid and fixed to grant much higher chance for all the least desirable values. Can‚Äôt ask for more from a gacha game though. It‚Äôs more about the grind and less about the gameplay. Late game is not for elitists set to obtain the perfect sets in a timely fashion. Best be prepared to stick to a character and a dungeon for the long-haul else you will be disappointed.",4
Take the online only feature away smeagle doesn't  like it take it away take it away ill download 50 gigs of fat juicy data and il will pay $70 dollars to buy the game i will occasionally get online to buy stuff  you can verify my files then but pleeeeeese take it away i want to play on the buss its so boring on the buss then i have to get on the metro to get to long beach then i have to walk home and use the restroom for like 20 min and i cant play cause the wifi router is on the other side of the house and i keep disconnecting i can log in to the ph account at least let me play Genshin impact not in the living room were my mom is cause then she keeps asking me to do chores then my dad comes home and he‚Äôs annoying so i go to my room and stay in the corner were the wifi reaches the best i cant live like this anymore,5
"I downloaded genshin to play with my friend. I thought it would be a nice surprise to her. At the time, I was extremely fixated on Cookie Run and was trying different games out for some variety. At first, Genshin became a game I played once or twice a week, depending on how I was feeling. But, as I got more and more into the game, I eventually lost my addiction to Cookie Run. To set the setting now, however, I became absolutely crazy over Genshin, it fueled my hunger for a game to spend rainy days playing. Honestly, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad thing. Playing Genshin hasn‚Äôt effected my grades. In fact, I got better grades than before. Although, it can keep you distracted from homework! Overall, Genshin is a great game. Im trying to make my friends play it too. Hopefully, genshin does not have to same fate as Cookie Run bevsuse I do intend on spending money.",5
I think Genshin Impact is a great game but there is a few features that I wish Genshin Impact had. One of the features is that for example lets say I was raising Noelle and when I was crafting I used all my hilichurl masks and thought that she only needs omnious masks so I should use all my stained masks when I am crafting but then I got Chongyun and I stopped raising Noelle because I thought Chongyun was better. But Chongyun needed stained masks but I used up all of them on crafting so I wish that we could convert things like monster drops like omnious masks into 3 stained masks. One more feature is lets say that a Gladiator circlet gave 40 crit rate and another gladiator circlet gave 42 crit damage so I wish that it would say on the screen which artifact is better for a character like it does in Honkai Impact. Thank you reading this and I hope you add these features to the game.,5
"This game is my comfort. I love this game so much that I can‚Äôt stop playing! I love this game because the animations are amazing the story line is üòò and the characters have such cool designs. For the people that gave this game a 1 star pls stop cause ur wrong üòë. I have seen a lot of ‚Äú uhg it‚Äôs so hard to get characters‚Äù this is half and half. Yes, it is kind of hard to get characters, if you do think this that means you are not playing enough to earn that sweet sweet primo. I get characters easy because I actually play so don‚Äôt come whining about how u can‚Äôt get characters if ur not trying. I have also seen some complaints about getting a 5 star weapon and not person, here is wut I say, THATS JUST HOW IT IS BE GREATFUL STOOPID. Ok so if I could this is my rating- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000/ 5. Thank you if u read all this, luv ya genshin muaw!üòòüòòüòò",5
"The only reason it‚Äôs a 3 star is because of the company itself. They hadn‚Äôt have any black characters, other than xingyan, who is basically a stereotype. They don‚Äôt listen to feedback from their players and don‚Äôt care about them. So many people has paired a lot for this game, and take the Anniversary rewards for example, gave us almost nothing. After we gave them support and helped them gain billions of dollars, not even 1 wish could be made. This game is extremely greedy and stingy, possibilities racist too. But the gameplay itself is really nice, like any open-world game you would expect, the storyline is kind of bland in my opinion, but you would like it if you were more into puzzle indulged games. There are barely any other body typed characters in the game other than npcs, most of them having hourglass bodies and being super thin.",5
"To be honest I‚Äôve had this app downloaded for quite some time. Today I decided to start playing, and the process of downloading the data takes a bit long, but it‚Äôs 100% worth it. Its only been 3 hours of playing this game, and it‚Äôs really different than your average game. The quests, powers, skills, etc. I guess I can say I‚Äôve taken a liking to it. Although I‚Äôm just a newbie, I can openly admit that this is one of the top games that deserve all its recognition. I hope to see that this game will continue to strive and have good updates in the future, which I believe will happen within time. This is the type of game you can spend hours playing, and it‚Äôs proven true. This is just my experience, and you have your own. Whether you like it or not is not my business, however I assure anyone that this game is pretty dang good lol.",5
"The game itself is so fun and i‚Äôm in love with it but here are some problems I have with Genshin Impact. First, I‚Äôve started this game in January and am already AR level 42 in a month which I didn‚Äôt rush anything. I feel like the game won‚Äôt be as fun when I reach the max level and is sad that the game only will last about two or three months. Second, I did not get my pity? I made over 90 wishes and did not get a five star. Third, I wish the resin count would refresh a bit faster because nowadays if there is no event or no resin to use, there is nothing to do in the game. But I absolutely love the Lantern event right now so please keep up the good work and maybe add more levels or things to do towards the end of the game when you are at a high level. I‚Äôm sad i‚Äôm coming towards the end of this game and I wish for the fun to never end !!",5
"The game is amazing and I love the graphics and gameplay behind it I really do. I have been wanting to play this game for a long time since I heard of it and when I went to first download it I was so excited and then I got hit with 7gb update or whatever it was. I just recently decided to make room for it and I needed almost 10 GB of storage and I know ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that much‚Äù but I don‚Äôt have any expanded storage so I‚Äôm limited to 32 GB of storage and I don‚Äôt want to delete games that I like and have been playing forever but I got rid of some that I knew I could easily get back but had to go farther and clear so much stuff off my phone it freaks me out to see the screen empty. I thought the game was going to be extraordinary and with its graphics yes it is, but I still think 10GB is too much for a single game, and it even misleads you by saying it‚Äôs only 3GB at first, I‚Äôm being generous giving it three stars because it is a good game but just please fix how big it is or do something about it.",3
"It truly is an amazing game and I was blown away by how beautiful it is and how expansive it was! It really reminded me of Aura Kingdom when I played it a long time ago and it had that beautiful immersion as well, just minus the advanced features that this game has. Only one thing I really would like, and I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough, is that there should be a cross region adding feature. Majority of games like these do have cross adding from different regions and countries, so I was confused as to why it wasn‚Äôt a feature on here. Some people have a bunch of friends from a different country and they can‚Äôt play multiplayer due to the locked region. I think it would be an amazing thing to add! Other than that, it is an amazing game, and I look forward to more updates. Hopefully later on in development the creators make it available to add people from different servers!",5
"I havent spent a dollar on this game, and it's very enjoyable. However, the amount of time you have to pour into this game to be able to really enjoy it is suffocating. Most endgame players are pay to win, and don't spend more than 15 minutes on this game a day. With genshin, you either have to pay with money, or with time. A perfect example of this is a free weapon in game called 'The Catch.' It's the best F2P weapon in the game, and it takes hours to get. Obtaining the Catch is boring, and most would much rather just spend money for a better Pay to Win weapon, Engulfing Lightning. You could, of course, get the Engulfing by grinding, but that would most likely take months to get enough in game currency to get it.

Overall, I enjoy this game, I enjoy the grind for better kits for your characters, and the grind to get more characters. But it can be insufferable to farm for hours on end daily.",4
"I‚Äôm not someone who is into anime (TV/movies or games), so when I saw people raving about Genshin Impact and decided to give it a shot, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to get into it... but I did. It doesn‚Äôt feel half-baked or like it was built for mobile; it‚Äôs a real, open-world game that just happens to also be available on mobile - that‚Äôs genuinely impressive to me for a new game.

That being said, my only complaint is the lack of controller support (which it sounds like may already be in the plans for the future). The touch controls are far better than most other adventure games that I‚Äôve played on iPhone, but I‚Äôd still much rather play with a controller personally.

My last bit of praise is for the granular adjustability of graphics settings - that‚Äôs something that I hope to see more of in future games (instead of just ‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, or ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù settings).",5
"I love this game and almost everything about it. I wanted to address an issue I‚Äôve been having regarding the game crashing every time I try to play on my phone. Usually I play on ps4 but a lot of the time it is occupied by other family members. I‚Äôve been playing mostly on mobile for months and never had any issues until recently. Every time I log in to the game, in less than about 3 minutes the game crashes. I‚Äôve never had this problem before but at the same time my phone could also be the issue. 

Another thing lots of other players and myself ask for is a higher resin cap and more primogems. My expectations for this happening, however, are low. Also please buff Amber she deserves it. 

Overall though I love this game as well as many players and hope to see many great updates in the future as I am very excited for version 2.4.",4
"I had a lot of fun playing genshin, and it‚Äôs been a wild ride, but following the latest update I can‚Äôt bring myself to play without feeling mocked in a way. I‚Äôm Afghan, and seeing the total exclusion of people of color in Sumeru honestly hit a little too close to home for me. Upon playing the game I was so surprised to see characters with names like Farod‚Äînames I‚Äôve grown up around‚Äîhaphazardly stitched onto pale skinned characters with European features. I‚Äôm honestly baffled‚Äîthey clearly put so much research into North African and Middle-Eastern culture, but intentionally cherry picked on the most important part of any culture: the PEOPLE. It honestly feels like the company is saying, ‚ÄúWe like your funny clothes and food, but we don‚Äôt want YOU.‚Äù Die-hard fans will sling insults and complain that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about race‚Äù‚Äîbut they were singing a different tune in defense of Yunjin‚Äôs character during previous updates. I am upset because I really like the game, but I‚Äôm not going to continue to pool my time into something that clearly doesn‚Äôt want to see people like me in this world. :(",1
I love the game! But when I made it to the first world ascension I had a real problem I can‚Äôt seem to pass it. It‚Äôs way to hard to have to use only elemental damage because if your not that good at the game you won‚Äôt be able to pass it and I get it if it‚Äôs for a higher world level but it‚Äôs should only be like one of those huge cryo flower thing. Because I haven‚Äôt even made it past the first world ascension and it would be nice for you to give me more to time to destroy the crystals when you get it to low health or change the mob we have to fight because I have probably been playing more than half a year and I have 10k adventure xp and I‚Äôm still at rank 25 because I can‚Äôt beat the big boss at the end of the first world ascension. So can you make the gameplay better and fix it will be way more fun for me and maybe other players who are stuck on rank 25.,4
"I love Genshin, probably my favorite rpg. It‚Äôs amazing! Even though we dont get to many wishes and primos easily, it‚Äôs still fun. The story is engaging, the voice acting is amazing, and all the characters, no matter what rarity, work well. Even Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa (the starters) are awesome to play with if you build them. I love the new Inazuma update (SO PRETTY!) and all the new characters. While trying to get characters can be frustrating, you always get more chances to get the characters you want, and buying the primos and stuff is not necessary to have a good time playing the game. I did buy some stuff and one point because I really badly wanted a character, but even if I didn‚Äôt get that character, I still would have enjoyed the game. Please give it a chance! The one star reviews are mostly people complaining about what they got for the anniversary.",5
"i‚Äôve played this game since the launch day and i was pretty amazed by it. the launch day rewards were so bountiful. now that it‚Äôs anniversary, i kinda expected more from it. it‚Äôs frustrating, all we get is some primogems and 10 intertwined fates. barely even enough for 20 something pulls. like come on! this is a multi-million dollar company and all they can give is this?! what frustrates me more is that the devs of genshin doesn‚Äôt communicate with the community. it‚Äôs like they throw away the community‚Äôs feedback. the community of a game is like it‚Äôs backbone. once you take that away how will it able to operate? i know that this game isn‚Äôt entirely p2w (pay to win) you can enjoy the game by being f2p (free to play). but it‚Äôs looks like the devs cater more to the people who spend money. well it makes sense since they need our money to pay their bills or something. since the community isn‚Äôt being heard, they‚Äôre finding ways to get the devs‚Äô attention. from giving a 1 star or attacking their sister game honkai impact 3rd. i do want to keep supporting this game, but if the devs don‚Äôt communicate with the community it‚Äôs honestly a lost cause. i know they won‚Äôt see this review, but i just needed to get this off my chest because it really is frustrating. i just hope that they acknowledge this and do better. i‚Äôm not getting my hopes up, but the least they can do is acknowledge this matter.",3
"This is wonderfully developed, the characters are unique, have a backstory, wonderful voice actors, etc. Before downloading, here are some things to consider:
- as this is a large game with demanding graphics, does your device have enough space? Will it have enough space for future updates? How old is your device and do you think it can handle such a game?
- this is a gacha game! The ‚Äúcool‚Äù characters are locked behind a system that is like gambling! While download is free and the content is beatable with the free characters, there IS the option to spend money in game to get the character and/or weapons! Please consider that you may not get what you want!

Now, onto the reason that this game gets 4 stars instead of 5: security! Most of the community lives this game, yet there is no 2 factor authentication! People have spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on this game, only to get easily hacked! Please fix this small issue!",4
"This is a stunning game and impressive for a phone to run smoothly. The mechanics of the fighting are well thought out and interesting enough to keep playing. I have only one gripe with the game and I‚Äôd be willing to change my rating from 4 to 5 with one change; add Xbox one controller connectivity to the mobile version, also please change the button mapping with B and A for the menus. It really throws me off playing the pc version when I have to hit B to choose an option, I‚Äôd prefer if it was A. I‚Äôd still want A to be jump when actually playing but in the menus A and B should definitely be swapped. The only thing that would make me play more at this point is the fact I hate touch screen controls for action oriented games even though the touch controls aren‚Äôt necessarily bad, but controller connectivity on the mobile version of Genshin and Honkai would seal the deal and land you guys a 5 star rating from me.",4
"Genshin impact is one of the best rpgs out there by far. It has amazing quality, as well as many fun aspects. One of my favorite things about the game is that it has a pity system. A lot of people complain about it but I think it‚Äôs nice. How the pity system works is that the 90th thing you roll will be a five star character. I love this because it tells the players that they will get a five star. It‚Äôs almost encouraging. Also, I love the designs for the characters. They look so cool and are fashionable. Some of the bosses can be annoying and all, but that isn‚Äôt really relevant. One of the few problems that I have with this app is how the game gets more dry in the later ranks. What I mean is there‚Äôs a lot less to do other than roll for characters. But I‚Äôm sure mihoyo it working on fixing that. I think genshin impact is an amazing game and would recommend you play it.",5
"I like the game. I hate that it has a gacha aspect, but honestly, at least in the beginning, they give you enough currency to attempt some of the rare heroes. I got the one I wanted in two tries, so maybe I was lucky or whatever. 

People draw a lot of comparisons between this and Breath of the Wild‚Äîthey‚Äôre not wrong. But that game was never able to hold my attention. I picked it up and put it down within an hour. I‚Äôve been playing this game for the past 3 days and have yet to get bored. The pacing is great, the design is amazing, and the characters are unique. 

The only thing that irked me is the complete and utter lack of diversity. No POC. And I know these areas are based on Japan and China, but this is fantasy. I myself am Black and loved in China for some time. And while I was there I met many MANY Black, Indian, and other POC sooooooo.... ya‚Äôll can do better in this area. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. If you‚Äôre planning on adding some diversity, please let me know. I‚Äôve tried to convince some of my friends to play and this is one of the major reasons they cite for why they will not. I myself didn‚Äôt try the game until now for that very reason. This is 2020. We exist. We always have. Please let us see some representation in these games. If there can be a Yoruba character in Fire Force, you guys can add some color to your game. 
That‚Äôs the only reason I have this game 3 stars. 

Thanks for taking the time to read.",3
"As a lover of RPGs, I‚Äôve always searched for one that fits all the needs I have and expectations. Interesting story, good battle mechanics, cool characters and a small bit of sandbox playing. Genshin hits all the marks! The story isn‚Äôt the whole game which allows you to just run around and battle if you don‚Äôt feel like doing the next quest yet. I enjoy the battle mechanics of switching characters and building damages. And the way you build characters actually makes you have to think about what you‚Äôre doing. Speaking of characters, their design is cool and I enjoy most of them, I will say, it is aimed at a specific audience, so the female characters outfits and designs are a little too waifiu for me. And the sandbox playing, once you get far enough, you get a home you can customize and take care of! Genshin is a good game, with a few issues, but overall enjoyable and exciting.",4
First of all I love the app so much it‚Äôs so nice and the time goes by really fast one time I was playing it and it felt like only two minutes but yeah it has been 45 minutes this thing is so fun but this one thing it takes up a lot of space it‚Äôll cause you tell delete all your photos and delete all your apps but it‚Äôs OK it‚Äôs worth it in the after you install it you can install it all back again that it is a really good app but if you don‚Äôt really want to delete all your apps and all your photos you can also play the demo demo is also really fun you get toDefeat a dragon my favorite character in there is Pam on she is so cute she‚Äôs not little fly who flies around she is the best I love her so much and she is the best I hope you guys read this and it‚Äôs a really great game,5
"I want to begin by saying, this is one of the best games you can play on a mobile device and it is Cross play compatible. That makes it very unique and opens it up to a lot of potential that unfortunately I don‚Äôt see it living up to. At the beginning this game is FUN and a lot of it. Here‚Äôs the downside: once you spend your hard earned money to get the dream build and grind your heart away to get the perfect artifacts for your characters you will have NOTHING TO DO. The combat in the game is literally perfect, but the co-op experience leaves much to be desired and mihoyo doesn‚Äôt seem to have any intention of improving the endgame experience. I appreciate so much about this game, but find myself picking up different titles more and more. Each update I come back hoping that something fresh will be brought to the game, but silly, limited time games that have little to nothing to do with your characters are not it for me.",3
"I have been playing this game for what, 7 months now? Anywho, this game is really fun, and well made. Though it requires a lot of time to get far in the game, getting to AR 16 for co-op isn‚Äôt too hard after a week of light gameplay. Though for people who like fast-paced games, this isn‚Äôt a game like that. There‚Äôs a whole lot of story quests you need to do to unlock certain areas and bosses, but if stories are your kind of thing, you‚Äôll do just fine. Personally, I think it‚Äôs really fun to grind for characters and strategize how to use your resin on certain days. There‚Äôs also so much lore to look forward to! No matter how far you get in the game. Unlike the stereotypes, most of the people on the game are pretty chill. If you do decide to play the game, make sure you have enough GBs, and patience!",5
"the game is beautiful and has amazing graphics I was very impressed when I first played but after playing honestly it‚Äôs boring.. there are too many quest that drive me crazy I wish they would end because I can‚Äôt sit here and do these quest for hours that are a waste of time and don‚Äôt give me anything.  and they are all so boring also it takes way too much time trying to get to your destination most of the game is endless walking, climbing and stuff like that. The dialogue is more dry than the Sahara desert I always skip it because I also can‚Äôt sit here and stand hearing these characters talk about something stupid like the dragon lord or some crap  and get nowhere. Also‚Ä¶ the whole character gambling thing has got to be the worst game idea ever.. who thought this was a good idea!? Why not just use levels to unlock characters or we can just pay for them?? Like they really making me wait till the character i want shows up only to gamble for them and end up not getting them because the 7days is over or whatever. Uninstalled.",1
"I have been playing genshin since 1.2!i love gacha games and genshin is one of my most favorites. Let me start off with how beautiful the graphics , the characters, and the little details are.  I can't even believe that this game is free.. Until Hu Tao's banner came and I lost my f2p pass. 

Moving on here are a few recent things I would love to point out. 1, the anniversary reward makes mihoyo look selfish since it's their first anniversary making it the biggest event.. They even took the reward post down because people complain about it so much. Mihoyo makes literal millions off of every event banner and from a gacha game you'd expect more rewards but no.. People that complain about the anniversary reward have a right to be mad because from a gacha game which u spend half ur rent money on and then they're like ""ok here's 10 wishes and a literal fish claymore weapon"". HUH?? It's your FIRST GENSHIN ANNIVERSARY!! open your eyes mihoyo omg.",4
"The game is amazing. Me and all my friends just started playing and it‚Äôs cool. The story the characters the lore the quest it chaling and fun. However i bought the moon thing and I haven‚Äôt gotten my anything so I bought it again thinking it didn‚Äôt go though but still nothing. My mom says 10 dollars is missing from her Credit card so it definitely went through once and I‚Äôm on the liyue archon quest where are you have to free some guy form the amber but I‚Äôve broken all the amber and the guy wasn‚Äôt there. I deleted the game and re-downloaded it but still nothing. I‚Äôm not sure what going on or how the fix it but I‚Äôd like to keep playing but i can‚Äôt advance in the game like this. So how do I fix it? I don‚Äôt want to make Account cuz I just sucrose. Her, itto and xiao were the only reasons really started playing the game more often.",5
"so i accidentally started the Yacksha's wish quest about 2 months ago and i lost the quest point, because i was trying to discover all of my map and i didn't realize i didn't have my co op until i had already lost the quest point, i searched for the quest point for 2 hours and no luck i tried to find anything to cancel the quest but there was nothing, i love playing the game but this needs to be added because i can no longer play with my friends and i have no way to cancel the quest so that i can have co op back, yesterday i teleported to the teleport waypoint i had gotten that i think was closest to the quest point, i searched for 4 hours with no luck, please add a cancel  quest option for quests that remove co op, i understand why you take away co op, but at least include navigation for the quest so if you lose the quest point you can find it again",4
"I have been playing this game on and off since October 3, 2020.  At the beginning, problems existed, but I was sure they would be addressed in future updates.  One year later, and there hasn‚Äôt really been anything.  This game has amazing combat, but no reason to fight.  It has a good story, until it stops being good.  The gear progression is great, but it‚Äôs locked behind an ‚Äòenergy bar‚Äô called resin which limits the rewards you get (unless you pay freemium currency).  And speaking of paying the developers, if you do buy the premium currency, you hardly get anything.  I can‚Äôt remember exactly what the number is, but to guarantee getting the character you want, you need to pay well over $100.  And each character has 6 ‚Äòconstellations‚Äô that increase their power, requiring you to obtain that character 7 times total to unlock their full power.  I‚Äôve seen people pay $1,000 and still have constellations left to unlock on a featured character.  You will enjoy the game playing it casually at first, but prepare to ditch it later.",1
"It‚Äôs an amazing game, really, I‚Äôve honestly gotten addicted to it, (Also Yelan is my everything) although earlier today when I was doing a quest there was this one bug I came across, basically everybody keeps referring to my MC as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù although I picked the female MC. They‚Äôve done this many times, like when they mention the MC‚Äôs lost sibling and use ‚Äúsister‚Äù although my MC‚Äôs sibling is a male. It‚Äôs beginning to annoy me somehow. It just gives me some sort of discomfort, please fix this. Also, as I mentioned Yelan earlier in this review, I also hope you can make an Act II to her story quest (Umbrabilis Orchis) reflecting a lot more on her past, Act I was a bit disappointing, I wanted to know more about her, not just about her work and such. I also hope you can make a hangout for her too. I get that her character revolves around being all mysterious, but I really want to know more about her.",4
"I never write reviews, but this game just deserves one. Genshin Impact is an extraordinary game. I‚Äôve always wanted to play a game like this, but I never had a laptop or computer to play with. Thus, I used my iPad to play this. Because it‚Äôs not compatible with my device, the gameplay is rather poor, but do-able. My iPad is a generation 5, and overall in good condition. It has 128 GB, and the game (so far) took up 12 GB. The worst thing that happens is that I crash every time I go into my characters, parties, and sometimes cutscenes. The cutscenes buffer and glitch out, but to fix this is simple: go into your tabs window by either swiping up or double-clicking your home button, depending on your device, (where it shows all your open apps) and then click back into the Genshin Impact tab. Do this every time you buffer or glitch out. It‚Äôs rather annoying though, how I have to always long back into the game and load it up every time I crash. But, it‚Äôs bearable. I hope I get a better device soon so that I can enjoy this game better. Great job, MiHoYo!",1
"First off I have to say I love the game and I can‚Äôt take one flaw and rate it poorly, but if you can‚Äôt play multiplayer without completing quests you should be able to drop them and this is optimized by the Trials of Tianqiu. This mission includes one very difficult time based trial in which you have to kill an assortment of monsters. I have taken many many attempts and found it near impossible and after some research found that there are others experiencing the same troubles. I also went into another side mission underpowered that I‚Äôm still half way through. Can you please make it possible to quit quests or at least make it so you can still play multilayer without completing them because me and my friend were very excited to play this together and so far we‚Äôve waited 2 days after reaching adventure lvl. 16 and I still can‚Äôt finish my side quests.",5
I want a switch release but seems Nintendo despite seeing that Genshin impact is doing well it tells nobody what happening this makes Nintendo look like a joke because phones are faster then the switch and PlayStation is better then the switch that‚Äôs what this tells us they can‚Äôt do dates because if they could they would have more money if they could think because they can only say they working on it be honest they are losing it if u can‚Äôt keep up focus on one thing because if genshin impact was on switch it be played more then most of the upcoming games instead they don‚Äôt give information if PlayStation and other devices can handle it then Nintendo switch looks outdated and it‚Äôs true I could understand if they gived us a reason but nothing no info no trailers just them saying in development a game compared to breath of the wild and they can‚Äôt handle it or push out a release date that‚Äôs just stupid don‚Äôt blame it on the virus that‚Äôs all them because they still made more games so viruse ain‚Äôt too bad that‚Äôs my words,2
"The game is great. It‚Äôs one of the best open world mmorpg that is available on mobile. The voice is great, the character designs and other stuffs are all great and I enjoy playing it. However when I was trying this out on mobile, it took around 7gb and it‚Äôs understandable but once I logged in the rendering distance was around 5 yards and the background is just black. When you see a special affect like getting wet or catching on fire, there would be this lighting affect that‚Äôs really bright and will probably make you look away. The cutscenes are laggy. Also when your fighting Storm Terror for the first time, you‚Äôll be blind so it‚Äôs hard to kill it when you can‚Äôt see. If you managed to scare him away then the whole game will just turn black like when your fighting the dragon and you won‚Äôt be able to see anything backgrounds or anything. For now I am going to wait for the devs to update the game and maybe fix the problems and I am looking forward to it.",2
"Reaching AR57 and sinking multiple hundreds of hours across 1 year, this game's engaging gameplay and combat is unparalleled for me. The thing is, the developers have no desire to reward long time players. With no drive to add an endgame, any player who wants to build the strongest characters or wanting to pull on Gacha is completely worthless now. There is no point to try to improve if you can already clear the Spiral Abyss and its super disappointing. I will always suggest players to try out the game because it really is one of the best games I've played, ever. Just pull for characters that you like, thats it. You don't need to have the strongest team cause its not necessary which is very upsetting. I wish they cared more about the game's long-term health. If you like story, you will find a LOT of it in this game, where it is the priority over everything else in the game. Combined with limited-time events, this game pushes a lot of FOMO for players. Beware before you start this game, do NOT get too attached cause the Hoyoverse devs do not care.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin impact since it came out. I couldn‚Äôt stop playing for the longest time and there are still things I‚Äôm discovering as I continue on. The animation style is gorgeous, the gameplay is fun, I love the characters. But one problem is incredibly annoying as new updates come out. My phone is on fire. This game takes up so much storage that I have to delete things for it to even update. It got so bad that I just had to delete it. With the new ios15 it has cleared up a lot of storage but it‚Äôs still too much. I redownloaded it and I‚Äôm currently cringing right now because the new update is 3GB worth of content that I‚Äôll play through in a couple days. Please solve this. Make an option for only certain things to load when you are in the area or compress the game. I‚Äôm not the only one with this issue. I cannot afford nor want a pc so please oh my fix this.",4
"I gave it only three stars for right now because when I downloaded it (it finally was downloaded after an hour, not the game it was my wifi) it was working and everything I made an account and stuff but when I tried to play it wouldn‚Äôt load me into the game and kept saying ‚ÄúInsufficient Storage‚Äù I think meaning that i couldn‚Äôt even play the game because of my storage. Last night, I deleted apps, photos and went back to try again and it still wouldn‚Äôt let me in. I‚Äôm gonna try this app again and choose the other option (the one with limited things :/) and see if it works cuz I was really wanting to see the full game without the limited things because it‚Äôs my first time playing and yeah..it would be great if there wasn‚Äôt an options and that it wouldn‚Äôt take up so much storage‚Ä¶Other than this I really want to play this and it looks very cool with the design and characters and everything.",3
"Your first 10-20 hours of this game will be really enjoyable. It‚Äôs challenging at parts, but satisfying to overcome. It‚Äôs beautiful to play and you‚Äôll be hooked.

BUT once you hit AR 30, you‚Äôll want to break something. 

I like hard games, Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, blah blah blah I think they‚Äôre fulfilling. But you will see that some boss battles are designed so poorly that you will actually dread playing. There‚Äôs no satisfaction when you‚Äôre done. Just exhaustion. And yes I‚Äôm mostly talking about OCEANID.

Go ahead and fight every other boss. And then fight Oceanid. You‚Äôll see what I mean. Trying to ascend your hydro characters will literally ruin your day lol

There‚Äôs no other explanation for this super long and drawn out battle full of unavoidable damage, unskippable boss monologue, and unhittable enemies except for really poor design. At the very least, shouldn‚Äôt this kind of ridiculous battle be end-game related? Not something you do as your everyday grind?

Ugh. Obviously I just got done fighting them. Oceanid rant aside, co-op and World Rank are also busted. If you rank up too quickly early on, the bosses will be too strong before you can even ascend your characters. You will be stuck. The game becomes actually impossible. You‚Äôll have to join other people‚Äôs worlds or be carried to get anywhere again.

So many things go beyond challenge and straight into bad design.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a year or so and every time I take a break I come back, the only thing I don‚Äôt like is the pity for hutao but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get her soon. The game is a big file size but if you have a good phone and chip you can run it. Also it runs pretty well for an online game for someone who always has low signal strength. If you are a free to play player you might have to grind a lot extra if you want to get a character with primogems. I‚Äôm a teen with no job for now so I can‚Äôt help but complain about how little primos you can earn but they did deliver on their anniversary and I‚Äôm grateful for that. If you pay for primos it will be easy to get a character but it will still take a lot of money, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking. Why not lower the pity for the free to play players because I‚Äôm rank 22 with no five star",5
"i love this game so much! and i‚Äôve made lots of friends! it‚Äôs a great map and i enjoy exploring around it and doing the quests! but there is a few things like, sometimes i‚Äôll be doing a quest and it‚Äôll just tell me that the character is doing a different quest i find it and i do that quest and it tells me the same thing over and over again. also i would like to point out that the game is basically a gacha of Zelda botw(Breath Of The Wild) which i have no problem with but it‚Äôs really similar. one more thing is that it is really hard to obtain actual GOOD characters which is a little upsetting, i‚Äôve been playing for a long time and i only have 4-stars and i‚Äôve been wishing for a 5-star and never receive i think the pity system hates me:‚Äô). other then those things the game is great and really fun!",5
"This game baits you into their world of beautiful artwork and great adventure. BUT you have to spend a lot of money to get 5 star characters and the best weapons to go with that character. They bait you on wishing for characters that don‚Äôt mean anything in the endgame. The endgame for this game is abysmal. There is nothing to do besides daily adventures and they‚Äôre a chore. The company is stingy with their rewards that they give to players, when other companies easily give out 90 wishes to each player. It is terrible how greedy the company is to their player base. Mihoyo is now quickly losing their player base because of their 1 year anniversary rewards. After 1 year of playing, they only give 10 wishes. 10. That‚Äôll get you if you high roll on the .5% chance a 5 star, but if you‚Äôre the majority of the player base you‚Äôll get a really trash 4 star. It‚Äôs terrible how greedy a company can be with this game, and how they give no content or wishes to their player base. It‚Äôs terrible and the company needs to see what they are doing to their player base because they are driving them out.",1
"I have never played anything marvelous as Genshin Impact. I wanted some calm, relaxing game yet thrilling and adventurous, it may take a lot of my storage, but it‚Äôs worth it. Every character is unique and I never get bored of playing it. The real big problem is, it crashes too often. At first I didn‚Äôt really care, because I can alwa just go back and continue, but as time goes, it‚Äôs starting to crash me out even more. For example, let‚Äôs say I played the game for 5 or more minutes, but if I touch Paimon or Character Button (upper right corner) it glitches then immediately crashes me out. I was in love with this game so I just thought it was fine, but things are getting a little too annoying for me.. Although the game is amazing, if you read this, please fix it for me. Thank you, developers.",5
"I‚Äôve played this game everyday for two months straight. It is just an amazing experience that can‚Äôt even be put into words. The graphics are LITERALLY breathtaking. It‚Äôs like cutscene-level graphics, but all the time. I‚Äôve never wanted to jump inside a video game so badly. The music is literally magical, it‚Äôs just so calming and beautiful. Touching stories, entertaining characters, extremely fun fighting, and a landscape that you can spend months exploring before having seen/collected everything. Finding 10 chests from walking around for 5 minutes is so fun. There‚Äôs a perfect mix of challenge and relaxation, and the best part is YOU get to decide what you want your gaming experience to be. You need to play for yourself, seriously just try it. (Also people need to stop complaining about gacha and resin. Stop being entitled)",5
"I absolutely love this game! It has amazing graphics and an exciting plot and almost everything you could want in a game! It really does feel like you are experiencing this game in real life. It is just a magnificent game in general. I will say though, you have to be prepared to face some though challenges or quests in this game, especially the timed ones. I think I have tried to pass one of the challenges almost 10-15 times already, and I still didn‚Äôt pass it. Those kind of challenges are kind of overwhelming to me.... I dunno if that‚Äôs just me or not though. That‚Äôs the only thing for me, so if you guys could maybe increase the time limit so that it‚Äôs a little less overwhelming... that would be great! Besides that, everything else is just incredible, I honestly could play this all week long if I could! PS: Paimon is sooo cute and amazing üòçü•∞!!!!",5
"Since I‚Äôve played a bit more I can give a more earnest review. The dialogue needs a lot of work. When you select a pre-printed response the auto response doesn‚Äôt match what was selected. When going on adventures it says to look around but nothing will be present when I leave and do something else and return then there sometimes is the objective I was searching for. This may be a glitch. Only pet peeve is the dialogue, please be sure to review and ensure the auto response matches the pre set options. Also why does the little fairy assistant talk for the main character. If I, the main character, have my own voice (as seen in the voiceover section) then why not input that voice into the gameplay? 

Out of all the games out for mobile players this is by far the best. It lags however early and just for a second. So far the gaming is smooth, everything look great and I can definitely get lost it in. The story line is entertaining and the scenery is breathtaking:)",3
"Hello, 

I think the game is amazing but for me I personally felt that the coop function was lacking. I had joined with another friend and thought we would be able to explore together but it seems that the exploration depending on who‚Äôs leader really only benefits one person when it comes to chests, waypoints and even statues. I can‚Äôt investigate anything on my friends map nor can I help with the specters or tasks, which I did not think would happen. Another friend of mine had explained the devs made it this way so people couldn‚Äôt loot resources on other peoples maps which makes sense! However is there a way you can add a function that allows people to do these things (quests and chests, waypoints or even statues) depending on relationship points? >.< might not be possible and might be asking too much but asides from the coop function I really enjoy everything else there is!",5
I enjoy playing this game very much so but with that being said there‚Äôs certain things in the game that could definitely be improved and fix such as the way of getting characters it‚Äôs ridiculous that I have to spend so much money to be able to actually get new characters. Because you only get main three characters at the beginning of the story and that‚Äôs it ! And I don‚Äôt really appreciate that not to mention as well the game dialogue talks about all 7 gods and yet we only get 2.Plus throughout the entire game you get to see and meet brand new characters that have a vision with a element on them but there actually not characters for you to unlock in the game! It‚Äôs just like a simple teaser. To the point that The final mission it‚Äôs like a prologue to continue the story furthermore but it doesn‚Äôt and it leaves you with a lot of questions. Plus having only 24 characters it‚Äôs very small amount when the majority amount is just fire type characters !,3
"Sure, the game is indeed fun but once you hit AR30 you‚Äôll come to a realization that the resin system is poorly implemented and doesn‚Äôt even compare to other gacha stamina-like systems. You have to waste more money just to achieve your weekly battle pass objective. The drop rate on the characters you want are lower than any other gacha game I have played and funny enough the pity system only kicks in after 90pulls which is about $200 and you don‚Äôt even obtain your 5-star character you want but a 5-star Weapon instead. They aren‚Äôt even going to do anything till people have complained enough about their bad practices, even the Chinese community have rated this game a 4.7/10, so that should tell you something since the game is created by a Chinese Company. Either way, they aren‚Äôt going to release any updates till Nov 11, so a month of being in a pathetic state till they maybe fix the game. I suggest you stay away from the game for a few major updates and then come back to play it and hopefully the game is in a better state.",1
"I heard about Genshin Impact from a YouTuber I watch, and it looked like fun so I took out my Window‚Äôs laptop and started downloading the game. After waiting for 4 long hours for 11 GB to install, I was excited to launch the game. But when I launched it, it would show the warning then it would take off (like as if I deleted the tab or something). It would happen repeatedly even on my mom‚Äôs account, who‚Äôs the administrator of the laptop. I was frustrated, but I saw on the website that the app was available for iOS so that got my hopes up. I grabbed my iPhone 7 and downloaded the game. Well, first I had to delete a few apps to make room for it but whatever I wanted Genshin Impact more than those apps. Once it downloaded, I excitedly opened the app...to the result of a white screen for about 5 seconds then a black and white screen for like 2 seconds; after that the app would just take off on its own. I went back to the area where I installed it and I saw in the description that it‚Äôs recommended to use an iPhone 8 Plus or later so I practically can‚Äôt play this game. Oh well.",1
"The game looks great and handles pretty well but there is something weird that I just can‚Äôt find anything out about.... whenever I start playing there is a dark, massive void bubble around my character.... it‚Äôs almost like a dome that‚Äôs about 5-10 feet (10-20 if you count both sides) and about 15-20 feet up. I don‚Äôt really know if this is some sort of setting or maybe a glitch but it really hinders the open world feel of the game since I can‚Äôt seem to say any of the world, plus the water also is a void where there would be water there is just dark nothingness, if anyone knows anything on how to fix this it would mean the world to me since it takes so much of the fun away. Just to recap there is a bubble about 10-20 feet across and 15-20 feet up that blocks out all of that you can see plus the waters a void so please tell me how to fix it, thanks",4
"Every day this game goes on it get worse. When I first started playing the only problem I had was lag even though I have amazing wifi. But as the days go on I‚Äôm getting kicked off all the time, graphics take to long to load(I was walking through buildings), when I open a chest I have to wait 15-1 min for its contents to come out, when I do a battle that has a certain amount of time to kill the targets I‚Äôm waiting for 30 seconds for them to start spawning(wasting time waiting for them to spawn which makes it hard to complete the challenge, I can never get a spear when wishing like(even for a 3 star spear it‚Äôs like trying to get a 5 star item, game freezes when fighting/ lags even though I have good wifi(stated in the beginning) and when I try to watch the cutscenes it freezes and the audio sounds like a Honda Civic without a muffler. But the plot and when these problems don‚Äôt show up(which isn‚Äôt often) is still a pretty good game I just wish it was on Xbox and if it was y‚Äôall would make more money.",2
"My friends and I have been playing this game non stop, I first only downloaded it on my iPhone 8+ not knowing I could also download it on my pc. Since then I‚Äôve been grinding away trying to reach rank 16 to play with my buddies. I‚Äôve had 0 issues with this game and it runs so smoothly on my phone although it does have a tendency to make my phone pretty hot. My friend had some complications on his pc but that‚Äôs another issue we have. For IOS it runs beautifully and the game itself is beautiful. The music, the characters, the cinematics, and the gameplay are all so well thought out. I never thought I could play a game of this caliber on my mobile device, I‚Äôm excited to see what else is in store for mobile gaming. Kudos to the creators! I‚Äôm in love! I‚Äôve been getting all of my friends to download the game, I can‚Äôt wait till we all reach level 16!",5
"I like the game a lot. The play style is really fun and smooth, the tutorials make sense, the storyline is really cool, the characters are awesome, etc. The thing I don‚Äôt like is how the events work and how much time you really have to put into it to uncover the storylines. Each day it kinda pressures you to do all these tasks and complete all these events in a short amount of time and unless you want to spend hours playing it it‚Äôs hard to do. Some people like playing video games for hours. I‚Äôm not one of them. It‚Äôs still fun to play but hard to really get into if you‚Äôre busy. And I wish the gacha system was better. More frequent reruns and no 50/50 would be a big improvement. I don‚Äôt really want to compare it to honkai impact 3rd but I do wish it was more like honkai‚Äôs gacha system. Still fun though. If you don‚Äôt wanna spend money you‚Äôll still have a really great time.",4
"I‚Äôve played for about a year and I have loved almost every minute of playing, but I‚Äôm losing interest. I feel like this game is becoming a chore and that is something that needs to be changed. The change could be as simple as fixing the resin cap to making more enjoyable puzzles. Sadly, my real issue with Genshin is the storage that it takes up. I know it says 3.5 gb, but with all the other updates and things needed to download such as voice lines it can be at least 20gb. I will say I also have only 64gb on my phone and I can only play mobile which is making it increasingly harder to play. I‚Äôm worried for all those will stop playing because of the new Sumeru update with the predictions of how much gbs that might be. I love playing this game even though I have had burn outs from playing. I want to continue, but with this storage issue I think my time is coming to an end pretty soon. Hoyoverse, please optimize the game or compact the game because I don‚Äôt know how we can continue at this pace.",1
I‚Äôve been playing genshin forever and I‚Äôve loved every second of it. I love the characters and all the little technical aspects but the only thing I hate is the lack of primos üò≠ my account is ar 56. I‚Äôve done every quest there is to do most my areas are at 100% exploration or at least in the 90s and aside from character trials and events and daily commissions it‚Äôs hard to get a lotta primos or find something really fun to do but I love when events come out and there‚Äôs new stuff I just wish I had more I could do beside raise characters right now but still I love this game and there‚Äôs nothing that could make me stop loving it. I‚Äôve played for so long and lookin back on how I used to play or thought was good is so much fun. I‚Äôve gotten so many of my friends into genshin and it‚Äôs more fun then ever helping them and showing off lol!!,5
"I just started playing this a few days ago and it‚Äôs become one of my absolute favorites. The details of the storyline, the graphics, the phenominal voice acting, the beautiful chracter designs (Amber‚Äôs got to be my favorite), everything was well made and overall amazing. However, there are problems with it crashing and lagging. When I first opened the game and it was the first opening cutscene, I had to restart my Ipad four times because it kept lagging and froze to the point where it crashed. I also noticed that I could only play the game for roughly 20 minutes, and then the game crashes. It happens all the time, and I hope you guys can fix this issue. This is one of the best games I have ever played, and it would be even better if you could fix the crashing/lagging issue as soon as possible so I, and many other players, can get the full experience without interruptions! Amazing game :)",4
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game, for sure. There are tons of incessantly entertaining quests (which are very interesting, also), beautiful graphics, amazing characters, and not to mention an incredibly interesting fandom that‚Äôll never cease to be creative. I started playing after my friend discovered it, and somewhat reluctantly opened the app. I was immediately dazzled at the graphics, dialogue, and easy gameplay. As time went on, my interest peaked. I‚Äôve never really liked video games, as I‚Äôve always seen them as repetitive and boring, but after Genshin Impact, I now like one video game! A true accomplishment! Anyways, the system in which you obtain supplies is somewhat questionable, up to luck and how much in game currency you pay. But the pros outweigh the cons by about 10,000 tons, so be sure to get it!",5
Honestly this game has been a good game to play to take up free time. It‚Äôs well animated and the attention to detail is really nice for a free game. Yes you can spend money and get all the characters you ever wanted and build them up but honestly the game gives you a lot of free wishes and chances to get your favorite characters for free. The story has been amazing so far and I‚Äôm really excited to see how much it branches out in the next few updates. I actually wish they would slow down on the new character introductions because I want to get to know they ones all ready out more. But it‚Äôs always nice to see the next big fun character they make. This has been one of the few games that has managed to keep my attention and not be deleted off my phone. I really think you should give it a shot.,5
"Let me start off by saying I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since launch day. It‚Äôs one of my favorite games. The world building is fantastic, the characters are interesting and lovable, and the gameplay is fun and challenging enough to keep you interested. However, the game has a ton of issues. Once you reach the later game stages, the gameplay stagnates. There isn‚Äôt much for returning players to do and daily quests/rewards don‚Äôt scale with your level. The game is built to give you just enough rewards to keep you playing, but never to help you succeed. Five stars are almost guaranteed to be locked behind paywalls when you reach the late game. On top of all this- and the reason I‚Äôm writing this review- is the fact that Genshin and Mihoyo give basically zero rewards to players. I‚Äôve earned more from maintenance rewards than I have from the first year anniversary event. Genshin makes billions of dollars and gives their players next to nothing to encourage them to spend more money on gambling. I honestly can‚Äôt in good faith recommend this game to new players anymore.",1
"This game is one of the best games out there especially for mobile. The graphics are great even on an iPad. It keeps you intrigued with all the stories you could do. And overall, the gacha system is one of the best qualities of the game. It keeps you hooked and gives you a sense of fun to see which character you could get. The people who cry over not getting the character they want should expect that. Giving the game a bad rating just because you didn‚Äôt the character you wanted is so immature. The plot of the game is also good too. How you have the ability to choose which twin to use is fun. One thing I would like to see is being able to see what you‚Äôre typing on mobile. I can‚Äôt wait to see more regions be introduced and for us to slowly be able to get closer to the end of the story.",5
"This is a well made game. It runs smooth on my iPhone se2020.  The environments are rich eye candy, making exploration the most fun part of the game. 

The story is pretty nice, but it is easy to lose focus due to the bordered sandbox style of the game, yet it is easy to get back on track with the menu of quests and the ability to have navigation to lead you to the right point. Fights are not boring, but gets a bit reputations. . .yet the game doesn‚Äôt revolve around fighting all the time and there is a ton of others things in the game to keep it feeling fresh.  

Regarding gotcha. . .I have never spent money on this and never will. I am pretty satisfied with what I have and still have fun! Some of the fights are a bit harder due to not having a plethora of five star everything, but with some patience and ingenuity, you can do what you need to advance in the game.",5
"I was recommended this game by a sweet boy over at GameStop when I was trying to figure out if I should try and purchase a PlayStation (EVENTUALLY).. 
Me; a current iPad user who is fully taking advantage of this beautiful game... and I am consistently speechless. 
Even though I was concerned about not being able to efficiently play the game without an controller. Genshin really did amazing with allowing me to be successful while using the controls via iPad (touchscreen).  
I could not wait to play this game and I am just ultimately shocked with the performance and easy utilization of playing cross platform with touch controls.
Although I feel that using a handheld device may be more difficult to navigate basic foundations of the game (locating quests, using combos, dealing with a small screen). The game is truly converted to a form that makes me.... speechless.
Mihoyo and the team did a beautiful, outstanding job with the cross platform diversity and conversion to held held.
I hope I‚Äôll be able to see this beautiful game on large screen one day...
And keep in mind, they the adventurers run slower so you can see the detail and beauty of the game. 

iPad 5.
Rare lag (only when there is a change in Lands).
Make sure to update. 
Make sure to close all apps before playing.",5
"I have to say... this game is absolutely gorgeous. Everything about it is extremely eye pleasing. I was looking for a game like this for ages, and I‚Äôm so glad I managed to come across it before servers launched. There have been minor glitches I‚Äôve experienced, but nothing that effected the quality of the game in any way. I do have a question though...or more of a suggestion. I keep receiving Tons of Mora coins as rewards and such, but I can‚Äôt find anything to spend it on? This could just be because I haven‚Äôt gotten as far as others in the game, but nevertheless it would be cool to be able to do more with them. Otherwise, this game has far exceeded my expectations! Particularly in the lore and character design (I have to say, Venti, Noelle, and the main character are by far my favs in terms of design!) I cant wait to see what‚Äôs in store!",5
"It‚Äôs easy to see why this is the second most popular game right now. It‚Äôs like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Attack on Titan clashed. Open, inspired, breathtaking world. Astounding voice acting. Characters that are actually like-able. Storyline that keeps you immersed. The list goes on. The true achievement of this game is the fact that it‚Äôs on mobile. If I wouldn‚Äôt have played it myself I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it were possible. Yes it takes up a lot of space, yes it‚Äôs not worth downloading unless you have a newer generation phone that can handle it, and yes I‚Äôm sure some people will complain that it‚Äôs not an MMO. But if you‚Äôre a fan of the RPG genre with a ton of exploration, collectibles, crafting, lore, etc. this game is a must download. 6 hours in and I can wholeheartedly say that it‚Äôs a masterpiece. Thank you developers for giving us this crowing achievement in mobile gaming.",5
I love genshin a lot and overall is a very good game though a few days ago I was logged out of my account I‚Äôve been trying to login since to because I was very excited to play with the new characters it kept saying that my login was wrong even though I had checked and everything had been correct I‚Äôve been playing genshin almost ever since it was realesed I‚Äôve spent money multiple times on my account on genshin so it is a huge inconvenience to not be able to play especially since I‚Äôve gave money I gave money to play not to get logged out of my account now it won‚Äôt even try to let me login to my account it is forcing me to make a whole new one I spent a really long time to get the characters I have and the level I‚Äôm at if I don‚Äôt get my account back I would like to have my money refunded and I hope that this glitch can get fixed I would really love to continue playing genshin impact.,3
"I‚Äôve been a fan of Hoyoverse ever since the release of Honkai Impact 3rd, and Genshin Impact exceeds beyond my expectations. The visuals are breathtaking and the game is paired up with a beautiful soundtrack corresponding to the region you are in. Every character‚Äôs personality is shown through their gameplay and attacks, which I find unique. Note that it does take a lot of storage. After all, Genshin Impact is made to be an open-world experience, so it‚Äôs no wonder why it‚Äôs not best supported on mobile. However, the twitter community that lurks in the Genshin community will never fail to amuse me, as they trip over the tiniest things. Most of the one star reviews are coming from toxic people who are salty from not understanding basic RPG mechanics. Please consider trying out Genshin Impact! Novice Traveller, beware of the hidden monsters and prepare to decease them all!",5
"I can‚Äôt get to the part where the game actually starts and it‚Äôs been a long time. 

I spent a long time in Wi-Fi down loading and once I had set up my account I spent more time than that downloading. The game said it was all ready to go so I left Wi-Fi because I had spent a long time there downloading. I‚Äôm on a cellular net work and there‚Äôs no reason it shouldn‚Äôt work on my iPhone 11, current software.

 But then my first downloads on Wi-Fi amounted to over 3 GB. There was no notice that I was going to have over 11 GB more to be downloaded. If I had seen that there were almost 15 GB of data to be downloaded I would‚Äôve chosen not to spend all of that time download it when I could‚Äôve been spending it doing something else. So I just deleted the game without even trying yet after looking at some gorgeous graphics and great reviews because I‚Äôm not actually able to get the game to run without shutting down and starting the download again (The app is stuck on the download because my machine doesn‚Äôt want to download 11+ gigabytes over cellular).

 So I don‚Äôt know this might be some really amazing stuff but it‚Äôs obviously not designed to be easy to start up on mobile platform for iPhone. 
If I had high-speed Wi-Fi Internet where I live this might be a completely different situation. I may decide to try the download thing some other time on Wi-Fi when I can just let my phone sit for that long and not actually be doing something like updating its iOS. Or not‚Ä¶",1
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since the day it came out so September 20th 2020 now don‚Äôt get me wrong there are a few things that could and should change like for example the lack of representation of other races, granted a lot of the countries that each nation represents there are only two or three black characters that are playable, keaya, Xinyan, and maybe another and there are well over 48 Genshin characters. But representation aside Genshin has a great storyline in my opinion, there lots of stuff to do (until you hit a certain adventure tbh) the story quests have loads of detail, the lore is really good they have hangout events with characters and they have character quests as well all in all its pretty good. Another thing that could change is the fact that at like at forty there becomes little to do",5
"When I got the game and read the reviews, it didn‚Äôt seem all that bad, however: I have had to delete more then eleven games/apps off my phone to reduce, not eliminate, the severe lag in imagery and audio. Although the game animations are very well established, it‚Äôs not worth it. It took up so much room in my phone my contacts had to be deleted and my group chats wouldn‚Äôt work. The last straw for me was when I found out my camera and my flashlight didn‚Äôt turn on. Immediately, I deleted the game and wrote a review. Now, I must retrieve all my contacts, apps, chats, etc. It‚Äôs not an online roleplay game, at least, that‚Äôs what I thought I was getting. I only had the app for a few hours so I‚Äôm not sure if you can invite people to your game. Also, though the character art is beautiful, you can only access two characters per gender. It‚Äôd be much more profitable to make custom avatars so people can have the option to complete tasks and roleplay at the same time. Most importantly, please rid of the lag. It is absolutely unnecessary to sacrifice so much for a silly game that‚Äôs not even the slightest addicting.",1
"This game is fun for beginners and is a good game to try out, explore the world, do commissions, do quests, make friends and much more! But when you play it too much and just do it over and over again with no more new contents, its starting to get boring, I‚Äôm adventure rank 58 and I‚Äôve got to say, on lvl 45 you have to grind artifacts s lot just to be stronger and it‚Äôs all about RNG even the gacha system, 0.3 for a 5 star without pity. Even with pity, there‚Äôs a small chance you will not get the 5 star character you want. But overall it‚Äôs a fun game and only when your in late game are you gonna suffer from grinding. Another problem is that the event rewards give too little primogems, the first anniversary only gave 20-30 free summon while the release of the game gave 50 summons, it really ticks me off, I hope that they will give more summons on the 2rd anniversary.",4
"Hello, so I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for awhile now and I‚Äôve had no problems completing quests, but there is one quest that just seems to not work for me. It‚Äôs the Millennial Mountains quest, it‚Äôs fine up until I have to get the cup of commons portion of it, after I defeat the treasure hoarders in the campsite there is no cut scene to get to the next portion of the quest. I‚Äôve looked up tutorials and everything and they all have the cutscene. I‚Äôve seen comments about a lot of other people having this same problem. I saw one comment that said to just travel to lumber pick and talk to a character named yanbo, but he isn‚Äôt there either. There‚Äôs no way for me to complete this quest and I‚Äôd really like to do I‚Äôm able to get primogems. Could you please fix this as soon as possible? I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you very much",5
"do i like genshin? yeah, it‚Äôs a great time passer. i‚Äôve been playing since childe‚Äôs first banner, and have enjoyed it so far. however, the game isn‚Äôt exactly f2p friendly, and the game pretty much baits you into spending money. yes it‚Äôs f2p, but only if you want it to be. however, not all characters you own are guaranteed to be the greatest.

however, if i do see any specific flaws with genshin, it‚Äôs would probably be it‚Äôs repetitive writing. all female characters are very similar, being overworked individuals with little time to themselves. the male characters aren‚Äôt much better, but with recent additions of arataki itto, im starting to get my hopes up a bit more. however, with the story behind shenhe‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt have much hope. yun jin seems pretty cool, though! 

the first two nations of mondstat and liyue are pretty neat, and have a good plot surrounding them. however, when we get to inazuma‚Ä¶the writing is‚Ä¶lacking. the plot line was predictable and it didn‚Äôt have many major twists, even after that‚Ä¶the main villain (the raiden shogun) was dumbed down to a dango milk loving innocent woman‚Ä¶seriously? she lead hundreds if not thousands to their deaths, and even killed off signora. i understand that the goal is to meet the seven to find your lost twin, however, inazuma had so much more potential in villains AND characters. 

anyways #liyuestayswinning",4
"Whether we‚Äôre talking about In game rewards or anniversary rewards the game gives barely to nothing. With a widespread community of millions of players Genshin has chosen to give 100 Primogems to only 1,000 players according to hoyolab. If my calculations are correct that is less than 0.10%, and on top of that, it‚Äôs only going to those with artsy talent. From what I‚Äôve noticed when genshin released they gave humongous awards such as 10 fates (wishes) but, as it started gaining more popularity the rewards seemed to take a serious downfall while in the beginning we would get 1600 primogems, now your lucky to even get 60. As more people began to realize how un-fair this is, people began to leave for other games such as cookie run kingdom, bandori, etc. Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt blame them, for all the genshin community puts into this game we at least deserve a ‚ÄúANNIVERSARY‚Äù reward that measures up.",4
"I love this game from the amazing storyline to the excitement I get while playing. I love that I can co-op with others and make friends and help people do stuff like commissions and other quests, I have met probably one of the best friends I‚Äôll ever make on this game. I also adore the graphics and the absolute beauty in the sort of mystical world I get into whenever I play this game. Sometimes when it‚Äôs late and but I can‚Äôt fall asleep I‚Äôll go on genshin and explore the mountains to sort of calm down and get ready for bed, normally near jueyun karst or somewhere in inazuma, but the point is that just playing the game, even if it‚Äôs not for fighting or getting exp, it still seems to have a positive affect on me and many others. I highly recommend this genshin impact, once you start really playing the game you‚Äôll never want to stop.",5
"The games event giveaways have gotten worse over the time I have played, and even the feedback I and others in the community continuously give has been ignored. The artifact farming is bad, the weapon banner is a HUGE money grab (more than other aspects of the game), and the cost of primogems is crazy expensive. Even though the players have spent millions of dollars on this game over its first year, to celebrate, Genshin decided to give away less than what you can get for first downloading the game. In addition, they had raffles for players who were willing to work for them by drawing artwork or making videos promoting their game. Other gacha style games give their fan bases a ton of free stuff on anniversaries, but Genshin out here turning their gamers into free work mules for our rewards. It seems that Genshin is caring less about the gamers the bigger they get. They issued a statement saying they would ‚Äúdo better‚Äù in the future, and if they do I may raise their rating. For now, I give it a one star. Let‚Äôs see if they keep their word.",1
"Genshin is a good game. It‚Äôs really good, but there are two things wrong with it. You say you can play it on mobile which you can. But it takes up so much storage speaks I can‚Äôt play it. I get it‚Äôs a high quality game but most mobile players struggle just to update the game let alone play it. If that wasn‚Äôt the case it would be 4 stars. Then after that the rewards and drop rates. It takes so long to farm for good artifacts and it‚Äôs not fun after a while. When a new character comes out you have to grind so hard just to get the, good. Even then they aren‚Äôt that good. The drop rates are crazy and I hate it. The primos too. God it takes so long to just get a single pull so late in the game unless you‚Äôre a whale. Most people struggle to get characters because of the primo drop rates. You guys get more than enough money to give us decent rewards or primos for things. If that was fixed too I would move it up to 5 stars.",3
"You remember in 1.2 when they gave out a free Fischl? Or how about lantern rite? That gave out primos wishes and even a free 4 star. In the early versions of the game there were so much stuff given out and now we get barely anything. They expect us to pay for everything and treat us like puppets without emotion, we need to get more out there than just spamming this Qiqi sticker we need to prove more than MiHoYo not caring and reviewbombing the game we have to get more direct than that. We have to get in every way of contacting MiHoYo and telling them personally to be better and fix their mistakes and while their in the silence they are truly weak. This is the most opportune time. The quieter someone is the more susceptible they are to attack, they are doing nothing and keeping us in the dark we should strike now while we still can until they give in and give us what we rightfully deserve, their suppressing nature shall not phase us VIVE LA R√âSISTANCE, if we can get to them directly, follow my lead as we prove to MiHoYo that we are strong together and we Will Have what we rightfully deserve",1
"The game is really good, I know many players are just giving it 1 star rn because of the anniversary rewards. Honestly what happened was that many fans(from what I have seen) got really greedy over the anniversary rewards and expected way too much. Sure I admit, I was a little down about not getting primos but you still get free wishes, which is still really good. Some fans have also taken it too far recently by harassing the VAs and blaming them for everything(which I find stupid because they are there to voice characters not make decisions for events). The game is really great and the story is really good too! The main problem is that many of the fans are children or act like children so they get upset when something does not go their way. Great game mihoyo keep up the good work!",5
I absolutely love this game but it‚Äôs made my friend change drastically. It started out innocent enough when we all installed the app but then he grew a particular Liking to a character by the name of venti. We tried telling him to to get attached but he said we were just jealous and we were just trying to take him away from him then he blocked all of us. Now we never hear from him he hasn‚Äôt shown his face in four months we‚Äôre starting to contemplate calling the police. every time we go to his house to his house to check on him we here rusting and grunts of the aforementioned venti‚Äôs name but when we knock. Silence. If you somehow can get in contact with him please tell him we still care about him and that he needs to get back to the real world. his name is Mathew. please for the love of all that is holy find him,5
"So I‚Äôve played this game since Day 1 and at the beginning there‚Äôs so much to do with a beautiful open world to explore. However, this all dies down once you hit level 50 where at this point it all just becomes a mindless grind. At first it‚Äôs tolerable but over time there just ends up being nothing to do since there‚Äôs no end game content. Couple with the fact that there‚Äôs no interaction between the community and Mihoyo and the terrible anniversary rewards, it just feels like an empty game run by a terrible company that doesn‚Äôt seem to care about its players. I keep playing the game because I‚Äôve already invested a lot of time and unfortunately money into it but really if you seem interested in playing, I‚Äôd suggest finding something else. You‚Äôll find nothing but disappointment here. The only thing that keeps me going is the waifus haha but other than that it‚Äôs best to find something else to play.",3
"I played this game for maybe half a year to a full year, I really loved it and swore to never delete it! I played it on PlayStation, Only PlayStation 4, but, I never touched my PlayStation for so many months for my education and I was kinda lazy to get on PlayStation, then, once I got on one day, I had to delete something because another game had no space to updateü•≤ so I deleted some stuff, Genshin I had to delete, but I promised to redownload it, I haven‚Äôt touched it for so long‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôm kinda jealous that my friend /friends have the new charactersüòÖ‚Ä¶ but, ignore the story I said, it is an amazing game really! I really love it! The graphics are amazing! The storyline! Oh, and I can‚Äôt wait for more! And I should of got back on it! I don‚Äôt know why I stop playing, but this game, is Definitely worth your time.",5
"I honestly can‚Äôt get enough of this game! This is my first time playing a gacha game, and because of this game I haven‚Äôt really played any other because of how much time I spend on this one. I even have Genshin on my PC and iPad just in case I‚Äôm on the go. There is so much Genshin Impact has to offer and eventually if you get caught up, more updates will come to give to the players! The view and graphics are gorgeous and fits perfectly with the soundtrack, which is also incredibly pretty! And the fascinating details on each characters and cinematic scenes gives it a whole unique aspect. I could go on to share my love for this game, but that‚Äôs all I have to say about it at this moment. And well since this game is still coming out with so much more updates, I can‚Äôt wait to see what Mihoyo has to offer :) ‚ô°",5
"Genshin Impact is a colorful rip off of Breath of the Wild. It has a main story that lasts a few weeks. After that, you can do boring daily quests, do monthly events you can finish in 3 hours, grind for artifacts a couple of times per day that takes about 30 minutes to complete until you have no more resin. There is NOTHING to DO in this game. Once you finish the main part it‚Äôs 20 minutes a day and you‚Äôre done with everything you can possibly do. 

The characters are great, a lot of fun and interesting ways you can play them. Strong ones will take a few months of saving up free primogems to roll for them so do that WAY in advance. If you‚Äôre spending money to get the characters you want expect to pay $200 per character. It‚Äôs a very very expensive gotcha game. 90 rolls and you got yourself a five star character, maybe not the one on the banner, maybe not the one you want, maybe they‚Äôre not even useful but you can just buy more in game currency for the second round of 90 pulls and then after 180 total pulls you will definitely have the character you were going for. Weapons are different. You can spend $3000 and not get the weapon you want so don‚Äôt even try. 

Genshin Impact is a lot like Final Fantasy 14... the first verson, the one they blew up because it was garbage. And even that had MORE freaking content then this game. 

Beautiful, great characters, occasionally fun, not a damned thing to do with it.",2
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this game is amazing with each character‚Äôs unique skills to the layout of the world. Once you get to about AR 30, the game essentially turns into a waiting game.  Each day comes with 160 Resin which will fully replenish after a full 24 hours. It also comes with a daily quest reward of 60 Primogens. These Primogens are your average currency in order to pull or ‚Äúwish‚Äù characters from a randomizer. One pull is a staggering 160 Primogens.  To get a full ten wish stack, you need 1600, and after finishing all the quests, you‚Äôre only way to get continuous PG is through daily quests. It takes a full month just to get ten wishes and you may not even get anything you want. World Chests can sometimes give from 2,5, and 10 Primogens, which in the spectrum of wishes is a low offer. Mihoyo, please do something about Primogens like make the daily quest rewards larger.",5
"Seriously. Are you kidding me? I went to the most critical reviews, and people say this is P2W? Have you seen a real P2W game? This is so stress-relieving, it really gets me hyped whenever someone mentions this game. I started playing right after I pre-ordered it, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since! This game is definitely F2P, although gacha is addicting, I can easily overcome the temptations and play free. Pity isn‚Äôt hard to get, although would like it a bit lower but it‚Äôs reasonable. The game‚Äôs graphics are amazing, and I started to sightsee on the game. What‚Äôs funny, is that the game just released and there‚Äôs so much more potential to this. The music is amazing, the character design, the art, the sceneries, the fights, virtually everything. This has been the missing key in my life, and I am very grateful for all the happiness it brought me.

Hopefully more to come!",5
"My favorite game of the year so far to be honest. I‚Äôve put a ton of hours into it. You hit a wall at adventure rank 38-40 where materials are near nonexistent and progression comes to a screeching halt. The devs create an absolutely amazing, beautiful world yet there‚Äôs no incentive to go explore when chests don‚Äôt respawn. Rewards for EVERYTHING in the game are too little. Resin required to progress and acquire gear with a super slow timer to get more. The gacha rates are some of the worst in the entire industry. Please please please increase rewards across the board and give us a reason to play the game daily for more than 10 minutes. People will stop playing even if they have the characters they‚Äôve always wanted if there‚Äôs nothing to DO with those characters. Weekly bosses shouldn‚Äôt have resin cost. Multiple active banners should be a thing. I‚Äôm holding on to hundreds of wishes because the banners only showcase new characters and forget older ones. So much love and attention went into this game yet it cripples itself at nearly every turn.",2
"The scenery is amazing, the storyline is interesting, and the characters are so fun and well thought out. There‚Äôs so much personality in every aspect of the game and I highly recommend playing it. I‚Äôve been playing since October 2020. There‚Äôs a LOT of stuff to do when you play for the first time (and all the way till ar54). End game players don‚Äôt have a lot to do, BUT events and other things keep coming in so it‚Äôs never really boring. Just take your time, don‚Äôt speedrun everything, just enjoy the story and everything the game has to offer So a lot of people are spam hating rn because of anniversary event rewards, just ignore them. The game is actually really fun and I‚Äôm f2p(free to play, never spent money). The rewards were better at launch, but that‚Äôs normal

Not f2p anymore but I still highly recommend it",5
"I have literally been playing this game for almost a year, I think it is very well made, does take a lot of storage but I mean I don‚Äôt use a lot of it anywaysüòÇ I am currently AR55 and there is still stuff to do, and once you log on for the first time you have so much to do, it will NOT leave you bored in the first few minutes. There is so much to explore, so many charicters to get, their outfits, lores, and regions are spot on btw. I can‚Äôt get enough of this game, there is an option to spend money, wich I have done in past many past events, but it is 100% not required to spend any money, you can play free to play any day. Genshin impact is also free, and I think that everyone should atleast give it a chance. Genshin impact is one of my most favorite games, and I don‚Äôt think I will change my mind.",5
"This game makes effort to research culture to try and make the game as diverse as possible, but lacks the most diverse thing, skin tones. It is disgusting that this company has done nothing to fix the issue of their lack of diversity. These people are aware of their blatant racism to other communities, yet they cover it up immediately after. I see the number of 1 star reviews going up which is fantastic, but they won‚Äôt listen to players on English Servers. During he anniversary Genshin fans here and in Chinese severs were upset about the rewards, so they changed them. But that is only due to the fact that the players of their home country were upset, they won‚Äôt listen to us. As a POC myself who has yet to be represented by this game (I am someone in the Spanish community.) I‚Äôm not so sure I want this game to attempt to represent my people and my culture since I know we will be stereotyped by this company. If you want to do something about this disgusting behavior then mass spam 1 star reviews, emails will do nothing since they send automatic messages.",1
Even though the game is very fun and adventurous I still have problems with it because it drains my battery very fast and takes up a lot of my storage which isn‚Äôt really good for me personally but I think the game is fun but also sometimes I lose interest and stop playing the game for a while because some of the quests I can‚Äôt complete and that‚Äôs really annoying and it‚Äôs very hard to get enough adventures experience so most of my characters are really weak like I have like five or like a handful of characters who can do a lot of damage also I think that prizes that go with primo gems should have a lot more because in cookie run which I‚Äôm not trying to compare it but it‚Äôs just that cookie run gives you enough for a ten pull on their prizes so maybe they should do that sometimes but besides that I think that the game is really fun,4
"Been playing for about 10 days now. Haven‚Äôt gotten too far in the game but far enough to understand it and see enough content to know that I‚Äôm going to be playing this for awhile. Can‚Äôt find any other words to put in its place. This game has me absolutely stunned with the amount of content, the east to use layout, the different characters you can switch back and forth between to accommodate for the task needs, and the amazing events that come and go. I have yet to find anything that‚Äôs just overwhelming or hard to understand. The way a game should be, easy to play, easy to read, but yet still challenging. 5 star rating for sure. I recommend this one to everyone. Outstanding work mates. I definitely look forward to seeing what else you guys can do with this game. Love it!",5
"Hello this is one of your fellow travelers, I am holding one of your workers hostage forcing/telling them to make Childe have a rerun and they said to ask you/leave a review. I would like a Childe/Ajax/Tartaglia rerun within the update of 3.0 or 3.1 at least, if you make him during 2.7 I will not be able to get him as in I‚Äôm saving for one of your new hydro bows Yelan! She seems interesting to me as but at the same time I would also like having Childe since he also interests me. If you do not give a Childe rerun I will tell everybody and I mean everybody all around me to not download genshin impact and not give money since you are not putting the most wanted characters on their like 5th rerun or something. All I ask for is another Childe rerun ONLY in 3.0 OR 3.1, those are the only dates. If you put it in 2.7 I will find all the workers home + managers and make sure they stay up putting a Childe rerun for us Tartaglia Warner‚Äôs who missed his banners/reruns. THANKS",3
"I love this game to bits! I can‚Äôt get enough of it..but there‚Äôs still a few issues tho:

-The monsters...Fighting monsters are entertaining but it gets annoying when the monster leaves you alone at random..then you try and fight it again and guess what? It‚Äôs entire hp is back up. This frustrated me during some quests with difficult bosses..

-The frame rate...Even with strong internet connection, it sometimes crashes due to the graphics. I thought it was my storage at first but no...If I am with many items and I am fighting many creatures and their animations and stuff, as well as fighting animation of the character, can crash the game or if I am talking to npc‚Äôs..the game can bug out before crashing. I apologize if I ramble but this was a main issue I had.

-loading time for cutscenes, areas, etc. can be a bit buggy and force me to restart my game..this too is frustrating since it can reset quests and interactions of characters..And even erase progress I have gotten..also some things don‚Äôt load completely in, example..Investigating a barrel and something pops out but it doesn‚Äôt appear at or it appears later..or it crashes the game, and cause more problems in playing.

I apologize if I am complaining..But thank you for making this wonderful gift of a game! I fell in love with it and I can‚Äôt wait to see what more it holds.",4
"It‚Äôs a good game it really is but there are some issues that I see that is starting to frustrate me and other players , we are starting to feel burnt out and the game is starting to get boring when you don‚Äôt have much to do let alone the rewards aren‚Äôt always the best I‚Äôm not going to complain to much because the app is really amazing the character designs are Beautiful and you get to join other players when you are at lvl 16 I think so the game is over all really amazing it‚Äôs just the fact that we are getting tired of feeling burnt out and we want more and I know more things will come along in the game but I would really like if the rewards got a lil better because there not bad but there just not enough sometimes and that‚Äôs what makes the game so frustrating it‚Äôs not the characters or the players it‚Äôs just the feeling of burnt out and boredom and a lack of better rewards that bothers me",3
"As mentioned in other reviews, the gameplay loop is satisfying. The characters are well designed, aesthetically at least, (let‚Äôs not talk about how unbalanced some of them are gameplay wise) the environments and stories are fun and interesting. The latest issue comes down to the anniversary rewards. Now, of course, this is just the symptom of the overall greater problem. Another symptom is the aforementioned unbalanced nature of some premium characters, releasing in an almost unplayable state, which is honestly unacceptable for how much most have to spend to receive said characters. MiHoyo just doesn‚Äôt care about the players of their game, and the aniversary is the biggest and latest example of this. They are a giant company with no doubt endless resources, and yet they choose to waste them all on stupid things like fishing. 

In conclusion, if you haven‚Äôt played this game before please consider everything I just said. This company cares about one thing and one thing only, money, even at the cost of ripping off their players.",1
"When the game first came out I did not download it because of how much data it took up and because it seemed too ambitious for a free game. However I eventually downloaded it because of one of my friends and I was shocked. The game is an open-world rpg and every bit of it is beautiful. The graphics, the soundtrack, and the storyline which I‚Äôm heavily invested in because there is so much to uncover. Even though it is not complete (new regions/chapters of it have yet to be released) I have not gotten bored of it. This is because even if the main story is not complete there is lore in every aspect of the game (item descriptions, side quests, events, characters). Overall I definitely recommend you to download it or at least try it out because I‚Äôm sure you will also fall in love with it.",5
So this game is really fun for me and that‚Äôs me talking who is usually playing other kinds of game. So this game I liked a lot but it made me start playing on my phone a lot more than I already did that was a bit already. Another this about the game is that it may say it only takes up 3.something GBs but it actually ends up taking up 9.something GBs so my phone came up with my storage almost fun when it wasn‚Äôt as close before. One last thing is that you do have to make some sort of account t which is not as much fun but this is most likely because it was originally a PC (portable computer) game. Other than these reasons these game is really fun and would totally recommend it if you are okay with those different thing. I would have gave it a 5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for that.,5
"This game is great, it‚Äôs really fun and I can‚Äôt stop playing it, but the Gacha system/Wishes make it really hard to get a character without using money or something. For the entire Xiao event I played every day and wished multiple times, today (a few hours before the event ends) I finally pulled a five star, but I got Jean instead of Xiao. I‚Äôm really sad and I don‚Äôt even like Jean, now the ‚Äúpity points‚Äù should be reset and getting Xiao before the event ends is pretty much impossible. And that‚Äôs including this whole event that was very commission-heavy, somehow I still didn‚Äôt get Xiao. Even paying for The Blessing of the Moon wasn‚Äôt enough. I think it‚Äôd be better if the 90 pulls guarantees the special character rather than any random 5 star character. But aside from the bad Gacha I love the game and can‚Äôt wait for more events. 

P.S. I‚Äôve cooked over 120 (Delicious quality) Almond Tofu for good luck and still didn‚Äôt get Xiao, maybe he just doesn‚Äôt like me :(",3
"I‚Äôve had tons of fun in this game but there is one issue for me (I don‚Äôt know if others are having this issue) every time I try to play the game it logs me out, it‚Äôs so annoying dealing with it when you‚Äôre doing a commission or a quest (I wasn‚Äôt able to write this on feedback because of the glitch logging me out) it first started a few months ago, it only happened every few minutes but then it escalated that it logged me out every few seconds as soon as I enter the game, I uninstalled but a picked up the game again, it stopped logging me out but it started again a month ago and it‚Äôs been annoying because now it logs me out when I use a wave point. Don‚Äôt let this feedback discourage you from getting this game ok? Overall the game is amazing, great story, great characters great graphics too!",5
"I was super exited, the graphics looked great. It took a while to download, so that was pretty annoying. When it finally downloaded however, (whole game package involved), there were black chunks everywhere. I had no idea where I was going! The only thing that helped was the mini-map. Whenever cutscenes came around, my device would crash, freeze up, or continue without showing the cutscene. I was super stoked for the game, but all I get to see is bad graphics, a black sky, and a small area that I can see. I tried seeing if it was a storage issue, but it wasn‚Äôt (I had more than 3/4 left of storage.) I tried taking off some huge files that I didn‚Äôt need, but nothing made a difference. Please fix this! The mobile version was overall chunky, and just took up a lot of data.",5
"This game is absolutely amazing the graphics the characters the weapons everything it‚Äôs just that is wish there were more characters that were easier to get like a special event that could give you a character based on your score speaking of events could you guys make an event in where you have to get a high score to get primogems, characters, weapons etc it would be more better that way and can you guys make 2 types of characters I want them to have the properties of dark and light one has dark powers other has light and you should also make combo characters let‚Äôs say you have 2 specific characters and they actually work together in the story/books if you have them both in your party you can make a ult combo by pressing a specific button otherwise then all of this, this game is amazing and so much fun thank you.",4
"For a free game Genshin is actually exceptional. Beautiful scenery, AMAZING osts (I‚Äôll sometimes just stay in Windrise to listen to A New Day with Hope and Qingyun Peak for Clear Skies Over Liyue because they‚Äôre that good), and intriguing lore. The gacha aspect of the game also isn‚Äôt half bad in my opinion. Moreover you also don‚Äôt need to spend money to get the characters/weapons you want (they may be somewhat stingy, but as a F2P I can still gather enough primos for characters and weapons every other version).
My only complaint about the game, and this is a common one for players reaching AR 56+, is the lack of endgame content. It gets a little mundane once you‚Äôve completed your exploration and world quests, and the only updates are events and new patches. Nevertheless, lots of love to Genshin and those who share the memory üòåüçµ",5
"I absolutely love this game started playing last year in late November. And been addicted ever since.  I have played so many rpg games for phones in the past and I usually delete them after a day because it becomes repetitive. This game not only has amazing graphics but the gameplay and the scenery are just beautiful , and well designed. The story line is constantly being updated and even allowed you to play multiple characters . I just love that you can choose many quests and daily things to do. Every so often you get a quest that gives you free items which is awesome if you play ftp games. I have spent a few bucks on this game to get specific characters when their banners come out . I love this game wish I had this when COVID happen and everyone was stuck indoors .",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for 8 months now, and you should download it as long as you have space. It may take only a few gigabytes to download but it gets up to 20+G. Watch out. Don't play on an old phone (I used to play on an iPhone 6 it was horrible.) You get constantly kicked out, but I'll start talking about the positives. Amazing graphics? Check. Interesting plot? Check. So much to do? Kinda check? It gets a little boring endgame, but they still update every month with new updates!! Interesting characters with backstories? Check. Hidden lore? Check. Characters to simp for? Mega check (bro Xiao tho...‚ô°) Don‚Äôt simp too hard and waste your college savings. It's the perfect game. They come out with new content every month and every year there‚Äôs a new region! So download it. Now.",5
"I love the game I really do but there are some complications, from the stereotypical designs to the lack of representation and not ftp friendly gets me to not fully enjoy the game experience.

Let‚Äôs start out with the little things, yae miko and a few other peoples outfits are extremely stereotypical and disrespectful to the culture. You change the outfits of the women characters to make them more acceptable for men (fan service). Next there are hardly any dark skin characters in this game, and when there are they‚Äôre extremely white washed. The ‚Äúdark skinned‚Äù aren‚Äôt even dark skinned, they‚Äôre just a minuscule amount.

Now we have come into mobile players, mobile players can hardly play your games because of how many files you need. Most of them can‚Äôt even have social media apps because of the amount of files. 

Then we have the ftp (free to play) friendly part. This game REQUIRES you to spend money if you want a good character because the pity system is hard. The pity isn‚Äôt the problem, the primos accessibility are. You would have to play for hours on end every day to even have a chance of getting a 5 star from zero pity, not to mention the chance of losing 50/50‚Äôs comes into play. It‚Äôs really inconvenient over all and I hope hoyoverse will consider fixing these issues.",3
"When I began playing this game I was enamored with the storyline and characters. The play style was fun, and I couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. One of my biggest concerns with it however is that there‚Äôs no representation for darker skinned people. With the various real life places and cultures this game is based off of, I would expect at the least, a few darker skinned characters. Out of the 50+ already released characters, there‚Äôs two darker skinned characters. Even then they‚Äôre only a few shades darker than the pale characters and have been white washed in official art. Heading forward I‚Äôd like to see regions with only / more dark skinned characters. Brown and black people exist! While this may be a fantasy game, Yunjin is proof that the developers can and will sink in time for cultural research. This just doesn‚Äôt seem to apply to darker skins and their cultures. It‚Äôs immensely disappointing and makes it hard to even wish to continue playing Genshin Impact. The lack of diversity is just suffocating!",2
"This game has proven again and again, that it doesn‚Äôt care about representation, taking concepts from other countries, like in Sumeru, and then refuse to have darker skinned characters of a solid culture. Liyue is based off of China, Inazuma is based off of Japan, Mondstadt is based off of Germany, yet when it comes to Sumeru (and possibly Natlan, which is not surprising with this company) it‚Äôs not based off of one country or culture, rather a mix of Persia/India/Middle East?? Then the outfits are stereotypes and poorly designed, there are so many beautiful attires and cultural clothing that could be used, not to mention skin color is important. This stealing of different cultures to fit a stereotype, then making the characters white to top it all off is outrageous, it‚Äôs not hard to do so, out of 50 ish playable characters only 2 have a darker skin, and their skin isn‚Äôt even that dark to begin with. This game gets millions in revenue every single banner, they could hire other artists that are part of the culture or make their own research?? Yet they refuse to do something so bare minimum?",1
"I‚Äôve been completely hooked on this game since I downloaded it almost half a year ago. The art for it was just beautiful so I thought I‚Äôd see how it was. My gaming experience has always been limited to puzzle games and I have terrible hand-eye coordination so I never imagined I would have so much fun with this type of game. I love exploring the map and finding all the little extra pieces that seem like secret discoveries. They team based play has really been enjoyable as well; I like being able to combine the different elements in my attacks. The graphics and artwork are amazingly done for a free game. I really enjoy  the storyline and events as well. It keeps everything interesting. I also like that you can invest as much time in it as you want to.
All in all, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a 10/5 stars.",5
"Ive been playing since launch and I cant lie i used to love the game, but I hate to say it but this game isn‚Äôt what you all think it is, you‚Äôve probably read from either reviews ‚Äúamazing open world!‚Äù and other things like ‚Äúf2p friendly!‚Äù its just not true.. i guess the game is enjoyable to alot of people but this game is just so repetitive.. theres not much content after 30 ar and ive gotten to 50.. theres also alot of characters back in the time for example diluc he was way more op than any other character and people just p2w their way to get it i mean f2p 100% have gotten it, but chances are slim.. the open world is cool and all but most of the time all you do is just try to get all the waypoints, wisps and all those stuff which is super time consuming and not at all entertaining. I guess it was fun at release but i do not recommend playing this game especially if you arent already invested.",3
"Genshin Impact is a fun game, the woman are dressed, and not looking like Hookers(like in most games the woman have very revealing clothes that don‚Äôt cover or protect them), which is a nice change, getting characters are hard, you should have a banner for just characters and a banner just for weapons. Because having them together you rarely get any new characters just the same old weapons it gets tiring saving up so you can do a 10 draw pull to only get weapons you have already. And some characters/weapons you should have a special event to gain them. Also you should warn a person when you hit a certain level the monsters will have a higher level, also some items like the ones to evolve your characters or your weapon should be alittle easier to gain from stores if you buy something they never restock it.",4
"The ost and the graphics of this game are absolutely amazing and breathtaking! I just wish the management let the devs take breaks from updates, since they have to crank out new stuff every month :/ The Inazuma act felt rushed with lots of plot holes, if they took their time, the story would‚Äôve been god-tier! Not to mention it‚Äôs hard for the devs to insert new characters, mobs and events every month since programming this stuff takes time! Patch 2.1 was very rushed and the events didn‚Äôt feel like an anniversary, just another old patch for the Moonchase festival. Speaking of anniversary, the rewards were a little bit underwhelming, the management could‚Äôve done better for their community! Overall, I love Genshin and I won‚Äôt stop playing it until the end. The game has so, so much potential! I just wish it could be brought out by the management more :(",4
Ok hi I have been playing genshin since it‚Äôs release in September of 2020 and it is a really good game I swear but there are some things I think that need to be fixed. I am ar 57 and play on both pc and mobile and and I gotta say yes the events are super fun but other than that all I have been doing is doing commissions and other than that farming wood for my teapot. I also feel like other late game players agree that the resin system is pretty much well just broken. Daily we get 160 resin. Weekly bosses each take 30 resin. There are 4 weekly bosses. That counts up to 120 resin used for weekly bosses ONLY. And if you need to farm let‚Äôs say weapon ascension materials the most you can retrieve is probably 2 runs in the domain. And this is not counting fragile resin recaps or condensed resin or what. But seriously the resin system is broken and so and so. Other than that the game is amazing and I really enjoy it.,4
"despite being a free game, many have spent hundreds and even thousands of dollars trying to get characters from the gacha, which still has horrendous rates on the banner. i mean, how else would you make money right? i also feel that players deserved more on the anniversary. i remember when there were fewer players, the community rewards were very generous, and now, they‚Äôre not enough to do even a pull; it‚Äôs a death wish for those that are F2P.  the game gets repetitive when you hit late game, only doing comms, daily resin, maybe bp etc. i was expecting more from the Mihoyo marketing team since Genshin has grown exponentially, even becoming one of the most played online games of 2020, despite its age. even though you can still enjoy the game without your favorites, it doesn‚Äôt excuse the problems with Gacha games. the graphics are beautiful, the storyline is great. although, i still think there‚Äôs much to improve on. i would give it a 4.5/5 if it treated their players a bit better and fixed the marketing issues.",1
"This game is absolutely beautiful! The graphics are amazing and I truly feel like I‚Äôm in control of my character. However, I prefer playing on my iPad, and none of the beautiful graphics show when I play on my iPad. The only thing I see is my character, the minimap, and the rest of my screen is entirely black. Even on the home screen before I press start game is entirely black. However, I knew that that couldn‚Äôt be all this game promised so I downloaded it on my phone, and it was marvelous! Everything was well designed and I could see the graphics really well. Unfortunately the game took up too much space on my phone and I could no longer keep it, so now I can‚Äôt play due to the nonexistent graphics on my iPad. The only reason this app is 4 stars is because I don‚Äôt feel like I played enough to determine its true worth and that my iPad cannot give me the full experience.",4
"The moment I downloaded this game I‚Äôve been playing it non-stop. The animations is very nice, the environment is beautiful. Very likable characters and not a dull story. There are many things to do in this game and its surprisingly never boring and the biggest reason for that would be combat. The many different characters you can obtain with their unique abilities and animations makes playing this game very exciting. I love all the backstory the characters are given ,as well, as it gives them a little more depth than just ‚Äúanother character‚Äù. Very well done voice acting, I‚Äôve never felt like the dubbed English was cringey lol. The voices suit the characters very well. I could go on and on. In summary this is a pretty great game and it drove me to write this review. I never write reviews.",5
"Despite the copying, this game has it great graphic and sounds. However, the gems system is what is reducing the gaming experience. Quick background, this game would ask you to use real money to purchase gems in game, so you can get for better characters or weapons. But please know, they are like a draw for prize system, so you don‚Äôt just get what you wanted. And after 3+ months of game play, and spending hundreds of dollars in games, I am 99%sure that the operator would check inventory of gamers to make sure you always not get what you want in the draws. Why? They want you to keep spending more time in game to build your team and most likely to spend more money down the road! If you don‚Äôt plan to spend anything, good luck, because you will be experiencing less than 50% of this game given the most fun systems are only for the better characters they provided. 
Just let this company go back to its own country and earn their people‚Äôs money already.",2
"This game is addicting, fun, and super amazing! I first found this game when my sister was playing it and asked me if i knew the game, I told her no and she literally made me download it! It takes a really long time to download and for all the things to load but you know what? ITS SO WORTH IT!! I love this game so much, it is my life, my happiness, and my all. If your reading I beg you to download this game! It has adventures (quests) and cooking, gliding, and so much more! I even told my SEVEN year old brother to download it and now he‚Äôs obsessed too!!!! If your thinking of downloading this app, it will be a great, fun and awesome experience! you‚Äôll never going to be able to get off of your device now! üòÜ Thanks for reading my review and have a awesome and adventurous day!!!    ‚ù§Ô∏èüëÑ‚ù§Ô∏è        -Person who is bow obsessed with Genshin Impact ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπüåπü•∞ü•∞",5
"The story is too short there‚Äôs not much to do in world,the enemies are repetitive and the whole game is actually repetitive...I am just waiting for blue protocol after I use up the daily blessing I paid money for it‚Äôs going where it belongs in the trash bucket. I get kicked more than I can play and there‚Äôs a glitch where you‚Äôre character is invisible when climbing, annoying. It wouldn‚Äôt let me put birthday in and I emailed them, they never emailed back. Basically you do this short story in this anime breath of the wild game,explore a massive but empty map with respect enemies, dungeons are limited because of this stuff called resin you earn so can‚Äôt do those all the time..and you earn new characters IF you‚Äôre lucky...or like me you‚Äôll get the same character you never use a bunch and get these pointless things called constellations...I honestly like dragon raja better. It‚Äôs a waifu simulator,and money grubbing lack of content waste of device storage. Fortnite is a free game and they actually keep adding stuff to do and listen to people. Whereas my email I sent a week ago has not been responded to",1
"I‚Äôve been playing mobile titles for about 12 years now. I‚Äôve seen hundreds upon hundreds of them come and go, and there are many that are brilliant. This title is effortlessly among one of my favorite mobile games‚Äîand games in general‚Äîof all time. It proves that a free-to-play title can have a business model that isn‚Äôt aggressive or exploitative, and that the base free experience doesn‚Äôt have to be a struggle. 

The graphics are astounding in how vibrant and crisp they are. The frame rate is silky, and the combat is so responsive. I‚Äôve found myself gleefully running around in random directions, curious about what I‚Äôd find next. All of this, and it fits in my phone. An experience this well-done fitting into a device that can slip in my pocket is mind-blowing.

Thank you. Thank you for proving that the free-to-play mobile space can be a great place to play.",5
"I‚Äôve been a long time fan of Honkai Impact so I was excited when I found out they were developing another game I knew it was gonna be great. Honkai Impact has always blown my mind how far they push mobile gameplay, to see Genshin Impact go even further is unbelievable. This game functions like a full game and has so many tasks to explore and secrets. I‚Äôve only been playing for a few hours and have already collected tons of lore snippets to read. Yes it‚Äôs a gacha game but it‚Äôs also an incredible game to play free and I‚Äôve been happy with my rolls even without spending. Knowing the devs history with Honkai, I don‚Äôt believe the micro transaction system will wind up being too money hungry to enjoy. Obviously it‚Äôll take some consistent game time to keep rolling but with this gameplay I am A-Ok with that! Amazing job guys you really know how to impress",5
"The most amazing game I‚Äôve ever played in my life. It‚Äôs defiantly a grind game, but it‚Äôs not pay to win like many people says. I‚Äôve been playing the game since version 1.3 and never spent any money on it. I‚Äôve also seen a lot of bad reviews because the game takes up a lot space or lags a lot, but it‚Äôs not Genshins fault that you‚Äôre playing it on a potato. 
   The music and scenery in this game are breathtaking, as well the gorgeous character designs and intriguing plot. But with that being said, the game has been lacking a lot in updates, with event reruns and features that no one really wanted. Not to mention the absurd lack of anniversary rewards. But despite this, nothing can deny the unimaginable joy that this game has brought into my life. It has something for everyone, and you will not regret downloading it.",5
"i‚Äôve played this game since before the chasm update, and it was pretty fun. one thing i always liked was the culture within the nations of tayvet. everything was true to life and beautiful. my complaint throughout was the lack of black and brown characters, but i was assured that if i waited for nations based on black and brown countries, this would change. but honestly? the upcoming sumeru update looks nothing like was promised. instead of being mostly based on one culture, it‚Äôs an amalgamation of dozens of cultures. and even then nothing is accurate to the real cultures, only stereotypes. but the worst of all is the blatant whitewashing. npcs from the area are paper white, and upcoming characters appear to be the same, with the exception of one character who looks tan AT MOST. with all the detail put into prior regions, i find it really distasteful that when it comes to a black / brown region, the minimum research is put in in favor of more ‚Äòappealing‚Äô whitewashed culture and characters.
i want to love this game but the complete lack of respect is too much.",1
"Genshin is a game I downloaded a while ago, I got introduced to it by my teacher. It‚Äôs a good interesting game which allows you to do more than 1 thing at a time. If you don‚Äôt want to do a ‚ÄòArchon quest‚Äôs‚Äô you can do story quests, or world quests and what not. It has VERY good graphics but I recommend playing with good internet if your doing an archon quest or a story quest if not it‚Äôs most likely to glitch. I‚Äôve never liked gacha games but when I first played my first thought was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not leaving this game anytime soon‚Äù. I do wish that getting primogems was easier once you‚Äôre a higher adventure rank but it‚Äôs fine. I did have to stop playing for 4 months since my iPad was getting fixed in the us. But appart from that it‚Äôs a really fun game. So exited for Heizou to come out!",5
"This is truly an exceptional game - I would maybe compare it to a mix of Breath of the Wild and old-school WoW, with outdoor scenery, music and breadth similar to the former and a grinding mechanic like the latter, but in most ways better than both games. Grinding more fun than in WoW, and more interesting variety of scenery than BotW, plus the very fun character switching mechanic. As people have said, you really don‚Äôt need to spend money to advance and have fun - I haven‚Äôt spent a dime thru level 70 of my main character, and I‚Äôm actually feeling guilty about it. If there‚Äôs any criticism, it‚Äôs that it is maybe too easy sometimes, but it is an appropriate difficulty level for a casual mobile game that you might only play in 10-20 minute chunks. Special shout-out to the interesting geopolitical perspective that comes through.",5
"This is equivalent to games on ps4 or ps5 and maybe even better. The games details and graphic designs blows me away just thinking about it. Although I clear up lots of space and still don‚Äôt have enough room to play the full game. even though the demo was a masterpiece,  I would indeed enjoy the entire game. It‚Äôs quite amazing if you put it like this. Most games that don‚Äôt get a lot of attention and it‚Äôs a extremely good game. It makes me very uncomfortable. Because, the game has lots and lots of talent and a spark to make you play all day. And I‚Äôm very glad this game has that spark, and it‚Äôs making you guys income to implant the money into the game to make it even better. My condolences to all the people who worked on the game, even if you did a small attribute to the game. I love you all and continue to strive. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
Although there isn‚Äôt much content in the late game mihoyo always has events for us player to have fun the graphics and they lighting are wonderful and every single update mihoyo brings out is filled with all their hard work there‚Äôs so many character personalities and you never know what what the next update brings although this is a gacha I feel like spending the time or money to get 5* weapons and characters are worth it for how they preform I just think resin needs a bit more tweaking like boost the capacity to 200 and make it regenerate faster overall I feel like there aren‚Äôt many ways to get primo gems effectively so I would like for them to add new ways to get it either from new game mechanics or new farmable domains overall pretty good game I‚Äôm sure it will be even better in the future,5
"For me there is no other word I can use to describe this game other than masterpiece. It truly is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played and can‚Äôt believe how incredibly well it runs on mobile. The attention to detail is ridiculous, graphics are eye candy, the music is serene and well thought out in terms of placement in the game, the dialog isn‚Äôt boring and there is plenty to do and collect. There is a great mix of missions that range from taking a while to just a few minutes so you can always be progressing even if you can‚Äôt play for very long at a time. I‚Äôve never played a free game where I wanted to spend money because otherwise I borderline feel guilty for playing for free. This is how in-app-purchases should be, make a great game so I ‚Äúwant‚Äù to spend money, not forced to. These developers deserve IAP because of the sheer quality going on here.",5
"This game is awesome. It‚Äôs aesthetically beautiful, a great story line, and extreme fun. I love that it‚Äôs an open world type of game play as well. You not only get to follow the gameplay but go off and do whatever you‚Äôd like to do on your own. I‚Äôve been debating for a while whether or not to get this game and I‚Äôm really glad I did. I haven‚Äôt been this invested in a mobile game in a LONG time. There is a lot to do in the game and they don‚Äôt make it extremely difficult to reach certain levels you need to be able to continue on with your quests which is awesome. I haven‚Äôt noticed any annoying ‚Äúyou have to buy this to do this‚Äù type of things in the game either. Everything you need is easily obtainable through game play. I think my favorite thing in the game is the wind gliding, it‚Äôs really fun and relaxing lol. 10/10 I definitely recommend.",5
"I got this game maybe a month ago, and I absolutely love it! I have spent multiple hours on it, with intriguing stories and awesome characters. I love how you don‚Äôt have to pay to win, and you can still get 4-5 star items without paying for primo gems if you have good luck. It has great graphics and is super fun to play. With the open world and side quests, there‚Äôs never nothing for you to do. However, the beginning area is laggy on my phone(I have an iPhone 7+), but it got better as you exited that area. It does lag sometimes to where when you open chests, you have to wait a while for the items to pop out, or for enemies to spawn in ley lines, but I‚Äôm sure it will be fixed in recent updates. Besides that, I totally recommend this game!(Best played if you have an 8 and higher iPhone)",5
"So I just started playing the game and finish the tutorial and most of the game was just pretty much talking and cut scenes I just finished the tutorial and all I really do well like there‚Äôs not really much to do all you do is just explore kill and do quest graphics fantastic Voice  acting fantastic but it‚Äôs just too much talking and also do you know all of those cut scenes in the game well some people don‚Äôt actually want to see them so make it when you double tap the screen a little skip button will pop up in the corner so you can skip the cut scene
Still pretty good game would recommend it
(If you‚Äôre patient)
Because also when you do get the game on like mobile or just anything you have to delete at least three games or some other apps to chat just to download the full game but still I would recommend it",4
"So far I‚Äôve been enjoying the game,  it‚Äôs not quite an mmo which is what I was hoping for but honestly an action RPG that is very well done.  The story plot so far is quite entrancing.  The artwork you can tell the developers definitely put a lot of work into it.

On mobile it‚Äôs a bit annoying to move around as the camera continuously zooms back in I do wish there was a way to lock the camera zoom to where you want it.

The attacking is actually one of the best I‚Äôve seen as far as mobiles go.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a heck of a lot easier on a console/pc.  

***I do wish it was out on the switch or on stadia because using a controller would probably make it a lot easier to move. ***

There is a gacha system but honestly they pack you to the teeth near the start of the games first chapter with enough currency that you can do quite a few summons without spending a dime.  I‚Äôve even pulled a few 5*s. 

Artwork - 5/5
Combat - 4/5 (probably 5/5 on console and pc)
Story - 5/5
Gacha system - 2/5 (you can play without using it)
Bonus - almost fully voiced over - 5/5
Overall - 5/5 because it‚Äôs one of the most wonderfully done games in a long while.  There needed to be a new RPG with a new story and there just hasn‚Äôt been any that grasped my attention.  

Again this is strictly my opinion.",5
"Wow, I am thoroughly impressed with this game. Do you have a fully open world R.P.G. playable on one‚Äôs smart phone is is fantastic. I really enjoy everything about this game so far and I haven‚Äôt ran into any issues such a bugs or lags yet which is a ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù in my book. I can‚Äôt really get enough of ‚ÄúGenshin Impact‚Äù and I enjoy playing it while saving up my crystals in ‚ÄúHonkai Impact‚Äù which is a really great game in my opinion. I‚Äôve been playing ‚ÄúHonkai‚Äù for over a year now and I‚Äôve been looking for a game to occupy me while I build up my Stamina and save crystals ( since I get a little bored and start spending them after a certain point) and this game is more than going to do the job! I think ‚ÄúMihoyo‚Äù have outdone themselves with this game and for any one looking for an excellent game this one I feel has a incredibly strong potential to be one!",5
"This game looks soo good and based on what people said (anime Zelda) I got excited to play it. After downloading the game I entered the game to 1/3rd of the screen blacked out. I thought it was normal at first and continued playing. However, paimon (an npc character) kept pointing to the endless void and commenting on the ‚Äúview‚Äù. At one point there was a roar in the distance and paimon described whatever it was to be something huge, again I couldn‚Äôt see anything but a blacked out background. I was so bummed because I missed what to me sounded like a dragon flying above me?

 Anyway the game plays out like a 90‚Äôs game who has to load every single pixel, imagine silent hill but with a black fog instead. Some animations also turned into a bright glowing white orb that covers my whole entire character (I don‚Äôt even know why or how). All in all I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not a bad game, but it needs to be heavily fixed before I can play again. I play on my iPad Pro so this might not be the case for other devices.",2
"This game is not very diverse when it‚Äôs comes to Body and Skin Color. Be aware that most of the characters are pale or ‚ÄúTan‚Äù. They released a new character named ‚ÄúDehya‚Äù. Dehya has to be their first EVER TAN FIVE STAR and has been met with a lot of scrutiny in regards to her kit. It‚Äôs so underwhelming and disappointing. Not to mention Buggy and VERY intentional. I never thought they would Intentionally release a bad character in regards to her kit. Honestly, I never thought they would make a tan five star in fear of sales dropping‚Ä¶, but turns out I was right. They are even putting her in the standard banner after her limited rate up, which makes about 0% sales. I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with this company, However their communication is degrading and useless. They do not care for people‚Äôs criticisms and or input when it comes to any of their characters. I‚Äôve emailed them plenty of times to be met with, silly emojis and terrible feedback. Understand your playing a game that is not very diverse and the company being very degrading towards its paying players.",1
It turns out all I needed to do was finish logging in thennn my account was back :) any way I‚Äôm relieved also.. probably should‚Äôve continued logging before writing the please help me‚Äôs hehe- ANYWAAAAY this game is still great no amazing and I‚Äôm so happy to play again even though I couldn‚Äôt play it for like 25 minutes :) I‚Äôm still super DUPER happy :) sorry for all the smiley faces :) I‚Äôm jsut so happy I‚Äôm never clicking the delete button again even if like the time I did it for a second then to get it back I‚Äôm never clicking delete again! I guess the moral of the story is‚Ä¶ make sure you log in all the way before you ask for help because then it‚Äôs super awkward and embarrassed lol anyway if anyone read this have a fantastic day/evening/night/whatever else there is (: OKAY I‚ÄôLL STOP WITH THE SMILEY FACES :) now~,5
"I have had this game recommended to me by my volleyball team and so I downloaded it only to find out it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE!! I hate having to delete games and apps for this game so I just
un-downloaded it but now it says my storage is full but I literally have nothing on my phone and I bearly have any pictures in my camera roll. The graphics were ok but it was very glitchy at times and I hate the fact it takes me 30 minutes to reset a password. I also hate that you have to get to a certain level to play with other people but then there are ‚Äúupdates‚Äù every like 10 days and it just takes up more storage. We should be able to play with friends within the first like 3 levels. Also there is like no main quest that keeps people motivated it just kill monsters and get 50 cutscenes. I don‚Äôt understand who even thought of that but I‚Äôm just done with the game. If you fix any of this mabye I‚Äôll come back but most likely not. Thanks for your time tho.",1
"The storage is ridiculous, if a mobile player wants to play they need to buy more storage due to the updates being a total of around 30 GB AND with more upcoming updates.. It‚Äôs kinda unfair to everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to pay just for extra storage, but overall this game is amazing with beautifully styled and unique characters. The map is amazing and so detailed. The NPC‚Äôs, everything, the storyline, shapes this game so well. I love how much fun a person can have in this game even if they don‚Äôt have money. Although, a person who actually pays gets more benefits and better items, but their money, their choice I guess! The wishing system along with the pity counter is so nicely designed I would give this 5 stars but the storage.. yeesh. Anyways, that‚Äôs the end of this review, thanks for reading this far and have a nice day :)",4
"Okay so not the best‚Ä¶over the course of a year of playing there has been so many fun events new characters and so many new friends, I was very excited about hitting a year or two yet to realize the rewards and gratitude that we have given to the game will not be returned? 2 ten pulls is all we get not even 5‚Ä¶ yes it is a free to play yet people dedicated into spending their money and time into a game we even got it on top 1 on the chart!‚Ä¶
Overall I would give it either a 3/5 or a 4.5/5 love the graphics dynamics and weapons and characters! Love the soundtracks and the islands, would love if they added in a banner for 5 star reruns instead of one rerun for a whole month‚Ä¶ very exited for hu tao though! Anyway this game has gotten me out of many states of grieve so it is one of my favorites, I thank all developers and players for making this game experience better! üòñüôÅ‚ù§Ô∏è",4
"The music, characters, and gameplay are super amazing and I know that I‚Äôll continue to play this game for as long as I can. However, despite this game still being somewhat recent and not even close to completion, this game takes up so much storage that every time there‚Äôs an update the game says I have to free up storage before downloading the new update. I suggest that players are allowed to clear data related to events after the events expire and are allowed to clear cutscene data after viewing them. Of course, players should also be allowed to re-download them. I know there are other games that allow this, and it‚Äôs super helpful. Aside from this issue, this game is, overall, super fun and beautiful and I strongly recommend people play this.",5
"I‚Äôm the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt know how to like things a normal amount. Nevertheless, I downloaded genshin and expected to like it a normal amount. 

What I‚Äôm gonna say will UNDENIABLY make you think I‚Äôm a loser‚Ä¶ and I accept this: If I could spend every waking hour playing this game, I probably would. I love the characters, the combat, etc. It is perfect for escaping the unyielding weight of being alive. 

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how oversexualized a lot of the female characters are, but me complaining about it isn‚Äôt going to change it so it‚Äôs a rather moot point. The gacha system could be complained about, but the way I see it, it‚Äôs not necessary to enjoy the game and therefore is not worth mentioning. If you get super heated at losing a game of chance, maybe‚Ä¶. idk like touch grass or something LOL.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact and was told by an online friend to play this game. Apparently my friend abandoned the game due to his lack of playing games, and he mention to me there‚Äôs too much religion in the game, and he hated the game. Dang dude. It‚Äôs like literally a game you need to play for little to few days if you want to like the game. Some people has no self-restraint when it comes to playing games. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyways, my point is I am in love with the game, story and dialogue is good so far, acting is interesting, and as an artist that draws, and paints traditionally, and digitally. I am impressed with graphics, animation, and art style of the characters. Paimon is so cute and the other characters. 

What could use some improvement is that I‚Äôve been experiencing some lag. While playing which is interrupting my game experience, and also the app crashing is another problem which I gave this game 4/5 stars. 

Also this is not feedback, but it would be lovely if you make this game available on MacOS and PC which would be amazing. Because I‚Äôm worried about using up a lot of storage on my iPhone 8 with 64 GB. So it would be a good idea if someday if you developers make MacOS and PC version of Genshin Impact. 

Overall, impressive game, animation, dialogue, characters, art, and story but the lag, and app crashing should be improved.",4
"I love this game! Although there‚Äôs a problem. I‚Äôm currently ar55 and I‚Äôve been doing the Valley of Remembrance domain for a WHILE now and I haven‚Äôt gotten one single good artifact that‚Äôs not a flower. I don't waste primogems on resin so it‚Äôs harder for me. Also when I do the domain I always get maiden artifacts and they‚Äôre still bad, and if I do get the vv ones the main stats and sub stats are horrendous. The same goes to the domain that has the Witch artifacts, (I‚Äôm so sorry I forgot the name.) as a Pyro main I have to do the domain and I get horrible artifacts. Can we please have BETTER drops? I‚Äôm sick and tired of doing these two domains and getting nothing good. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the game but it needs better artifact drops.

Thank you for creating such a beautiful game! 

also please bless my account with luck or something to get Ayakas weapon. <33",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for awhile now (adventures rank 29) and it has been amazing. There are only a couple problems that have made me contemplate deleting the game. The first is the amount of crashes on mobile. This game crashes every 5-10 minutes making it almost impossible to play. I have contacted the game developers, but have not gotten and answer. The other big problem is the leveling system. There simply isn‚Äôt enough quest in between story mode. This makes extremely hard to climb up in rank and discourages a lot of people. I would hope that they would at least fix the crashing problem or extend the amount of time the game will stay open, but I doubt this will happen anytime soon. Overall the game is great and it looks really good on mobile, but drives me insane. Also the buying system in the game is against you. Having to spend around $15 for 10 wishes.",3
"The game overall is very nice I like the graphics and it is very nice that this is a phone game not a console game üéÆ for some people who can‚Äôt afford games or can‚Äôt afford consoles the characters are nice although I have a few suggestions maybe you could add emotes I feel like emotes would be good if you would like to role play with your friends also I would like some daily rewards I would like to see them in Genshin Impact OH and another thing I think the characters ( I‚Äôm not talking about the regular Lisa, Kaeya, and Amber type I‚Äôm talking about like Diona Tartiguila and etc) would be easier to get because for people who don‚Äôt know how to get wishes or find it hard also I would like to see Lumine and Aether actually talk to people other than Paimon I wish they had voice lines like everybody else but I don‚Äôt think you can do that now 

Thank you

Honeybee",5
"i had preregistered since the beginning, sadly i could‚Äôt play because when i open the game its just stayed in a white screen and it never worked but now today it finally work i played it for a little while and it was awesome, one if not the best game in mobile yet. even tho my phone barely handles the game at the lowest quality i can still have fun and explore the world, its like botw but with waifus. this may be selfish of my part but i wanted to ask if could get all the update rewards/bugs rewards that were given in the game since lunch, the only reason why i am asking for such a selfish request its because i couldn‚Äôt played before because of my old phone. :( so if you doit awesome, but if its not possible i understand and i will still love you and played this game. :D",5
"This is a free to play a game that has the most elbow grease put into it that I‚Äôve ever seen. While far from perfect, with a limited number of characters - the gameplay by itself has the most effort I‚Äôve seen put into the core game, to deter from the common monotonous gameplay of other games of its type. MTX are present as well as the common Loot rarities and content-based leveling up ‚Äì but none of this is necessary. In terms of game interaction there are a lot of borrowed elements here, however some of the games design decisions in interface are so well thought through and refined for a F2P game. My one criticism is that you won‚Äôt run into a point where there is legitimately very little to do. I think this is going to round out over time with more characters in weapon types, however they aren‚Äôt here yet. Also the world itself can use more variety.",5
"I love this game and started playing this April and played for hours every day. But to get a five star character you have to grind like I did and still it takes 2-3 months if you are lucky. After playing for 3 months and grinding I finally got xiao. And this is how long it takes if you are free to play. If you spend 100 dollars you can get a five star. Just buy botw and save 40 dollars. Also,Please Miyoho make the amount of wishes to get a five star to 50. Also you can get these things called C1 five star characters that are after you get a five character you just get a slightly buffed one after doing 90 wishes! Also stop it will the constant artifact farming and grind. I hate to say this because I don‚Äôt want a breath of the wild copy but, make it more like breath of the wild. Thank you for reading and please respond miyoho and HoYo verse.",4
"I have an iphone 6s and i‚Äôve never had problems running games like this with large open worlds (heck, i play dragon raja using data all the time). And though the description says it‚Äôs recommended for iphone 8 and up, its pretty much unplayable and, trust me, it‚Äôs not even worth trying if you have an older device like mine. first of all it crashed a bunch in the beginning. after the crashes i was finally able to get to the downloading screen. but after it downloaded the cutscenes lagged  so bad i had to close the app. once the cutscenes were over i got to the game play and to my surprise the entire environment wasn‚Äôt loaded. there‚Äôs just a huge void and you can only see a tiny portion of the world at once. not to mention it takes about 5 minutes to load the game every single time. from the reviews, it sounds like a great game and I want to give it five stars. but, until i can actually play the game, i‚Äôll leave it at two stars for now and hope it gets fixed",2
"When I first pre-registered, I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to expect, but I can say for a fact that I am addicted! I‚Äôd visited the Genshin Impact website several times, and even though I missed the beta, I‚Äôm still satisfied that I stuck along to experience it! It has the vibes of an anime Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but with the character collection aspect(s) of an anime gacha-style game (i.e. you spend in-game currency that you earn or purchase in order to roll for a chance of obtaining new characters as well as items). The way the music changes when running or in combat is amazing~ Honestly, even though there‚Äôs micro-transactions, if you explore enough, I feel like you could earn anything- Just have to be willing to put in the time for games like this! Also, I have my hopes up regarding controller compatibility for the mobile versions!",5
"I love the game. Genshin Impact is a open-world game meaning it has a lot to explore and that awesome, it definitely needs a long time before you get extremely good at gameplay but it‚Äôs really fun!

The games textures and scenes are beautiful and cinematic. The graphics are extremely high quality and can be adjusted to get a smooth gameplay. There is such a diverse amount of character that you may need to favor everyone! The quest and battle that goes alongside the story is so exciting. You explore new bosses, add new mobs to your archive, encounter new enemies and find ingredients for recipes!

The storyline is awesome with the Traveler being from a different world, and with the Traveler always trying to find clues as to where their lost sibling is, it spikes more excitement!

I love this game, but the more you play the more boring it kind of gets. If I'm being completely honest, the game gets less exciting because when you reach a high AR (45+) you'd have lots of equipment and gears and eventually you‚Äôll get overpowered and thats where the fun is lost, but this is a definite 4/5!!!!

I recommend if you like playing along with storylines, open-world games, characters to collect. I hope any new players enjoy the game and give feedback, it will be very helpful to the developers!",4
"This game has cured my boredom many times and there are too many good things about the game to mention. I am in love with the graphics and the attention to detail in the game. The storyline and plot is perfect, it catches my attention every time. I just want to say that when you‚Äôre a beginner, sometimes people will join your world and help you fight bosses. This always made my day because at the time I was about AR (adventure rank) 18 and it helped me so much to get EXP, artifacts, and other important resources. At first, it may seem overwhelming considering how many options and possibilities you have but one thing that I did was research. This helped me to figure out where I can find things, different battle tactics, how to use something properly, and much more. Thank you so much for making this game:)",5
"Okay let me start off by saying Genshin is a really cool game, the characters and stories are awesome, the graphics are amazing and the fact that it makes you use brain power to get to certain points instead of just buying things makes it even better, but the issues I have with it are 1. It takes up literally my entire phone storage to just download it‚Äî I mean, I deleted every single app I could off my phone to play it one time and it felt like my phone was on fire. I have an iPhone12 and if I‚Äôm correct this isnt an old or outdated phone. And 2. There is hardly any diversity in the game. Other than characters that are extremely problematic, theres about 1-2 people in the game that aren‚Äôt white as snow. Theres a lot of cultural offense in the game and its been getting ignored for the longest time. But other than those two things I dont have that many other problems with it.",3
"The whole game is so good. To the 3D models,story, characters design, and it‚Äôs a open world game that is a mobile game. I‚Äôve been playing this game since November, so I can see the problems. The first problem is recent to 2.0, since the start of it I‚Äôve been crashing more frequently then before. And now as I type I can‚Äôt play the game for a least 5 seconds, I hope you are ready notified about that. Secondly original resin time should be increased and not being resin. And  if you want to keep the time then put 3 or 5 original resin a minute, not 1. The last one is put in better battle pass rewards for people who don‚Äôt buy it. And I don‚Äôt meet food no body needs that it people can make it in game,For example more hero‚Äôs wit. This game is very fun for me and some other‚Äôs I can‚Äôt wait for the following updates to happen.",4
"So far in the game there are 2 poc. Keaya and Xinyan. With over 40 characters there are only 2 people of color. I love this game. Its easily become one of my favorites but it‚Äôs disappointing the majority of characters having white or pale skin tones. For the regions they‚Äôre based on you can make the argument that it makes sense. And you can make the argument that with more regions being added soon we can possibly see more people of color. But with recent leaks of the Sumeru characters all being light skinned while only one of them has darker skin. Not to mention that one of the characters is a harmful stereotype, it makes the company look as if they don‚Äôt care about adding more skin tones and creating diversity in the game. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having pale characters along as the majority of playable characters (AND NPCS!!!) aren't light skinned. There should definitely be a greater ratio of darker skinned characters then lighter skinned in the Sumeru update. The NPCs should also reflect the region by not all of them being white passing.",1
"The lack of characters with darker skin is absurd. With a whole new nation coming out soon with extremely pale skin doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. Yes, not all South Asians have darker skin, but when you‚Äôre making a nation that is a mixture of ethnicities you are expected to put in some effort. You cannot highly research nations with predominately pale skin and respect it but disrespect a different nation because of their predominately dark skin. A new leaked character‚Äôs design is extremely orientalist and disrespectful. This company had plenty of time to make a simple change of giving Sumeru characters dark skin and not disrespecting the many cultures it includes, but chose not to. They are disrespecting so many people and should be allowed to get away with it. Do not play this game if you are expecting great representation for POC with dark skin. Their dark skinned characters are filled with stereotypes and they do not know how to properly give good representation. It‚Äôs a shame because of how incredible this game is but the flaws cannot be ignored.",1
"I remember the first time I played Genshin Impact I was speechless. The storyline and the graphics are so high quality I don‚Äôt know how someone would not like the game. The updates that happen often always bring so much more to the game. I would highly suggest Genshin Impact if you want a game with high graphics and a good adventurous storyline.

I absolutely love genshin but it‚Äôs come to a point where i can no longer have it on my phone. i simply just don‚Äôt have enough storage. i may not be able to play on my phone but i got it on my pc for this exact reason. i‚Äôm still learning the controls for pc but im determined to succeed just to be given the ability to play again. i highly suggest genshin impact. be aware if you get it on your phone it is possible you will run out of storage.",5
"I absolutely love Genshin and the characters in it. I have been playing for almost a year now, and it‚Äôs an extremely fun game. I will say this though: the rewards are unfair. It‚Äôs extremely hard to get good characters and i wish Mihoyo was a little more forgiving. It‚Äôs not very f2p friendly and i don‚Äôt recommend this game if you struggle with grinding or working hard in games. Daily commissions give you 60 primogems (currency to get characters/weapons), that‚Äôs not even enough for one wish. Another thing i will add is that I wish mihoyo would add more for late game players. I will still play the game though, hopefully genshin will get better :)
Update: Sometimes i wish the game didn‚Äôt take up so much storage because i never have enough. I sadly can‚Äôt get the new update because of the lack of storage </3",5
"Honestly, everyone is calling Genshin Impact stingy, but to be honest we can‚Äôt say that is true. We are provided with a free game, great graphics, they don‚Äôt charge for voice overs, and overall a great game. So what if OTHER game‚Äôs anniversaries have good rewards. I do think it can  be a problem if they keeping going like this, but they do whatever they want to do. I think it‚Äôs pretty wrong to point out on ONE reward, and say that Genshin is boring, stingy, and a horrible game. If one reward changes people‚Äôs opinion that much, I‚Äôd rather say they are the stingy ones. However I think Genshin should take care of the matter. Everyone is going psycho, and there wasn‚Äôt really any posts to solve the problem. I don‚Äôt know if this is a marketing deal, but I think it would be better to give some type of explanation.",5
"First let me state that there is nothing wrong with Genshin Impact itself. It is a beautiful game. The music, the characters, the regions, and the quests. My problem is with the company who created the game, mihoyo. Today genshin players should be celebrating Genshin Inpacts 1 year anniversary, but instead the focus is on the terrible rewards we got. We got a cute little interactive movie, going through our journey of genshin impact. But the actual rewards where horrible. 10 fates, which you can only fully acquire if you log in every day for the next week (which is also the same rewards we got during lantern rite) 40 primogems and 300 mora. Mihoyo was generous enough to give big streamers 15k primogems for its anniversary, but the other players get absolute garbage. for a multi million dollar company, they fully can afford to spare 1600 primogems to each of their players. I hope mihoyo is actually listening to their players demands and requests because if they continue to treat their players like this, their game will no longer be successful.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for almost a year, and it is easily the best game on my phone. I could play it for hours and still have content to do! I find myself looking forward to the next day, just because I know I can play again  the next day. Lots of people are saying that mobile isn‚Äôt good to play on, but I play on my iPhone and the graphics are still incredible. This is a beautiful game that I would easily recommend. There has only been a few glitches in the year I‚Äôve been playing, and they where all resolved after at least a few minutes! It amazes me the little glitching I‚Äôve been getting. The only issue is the amount of storage but that can‚Äôt really be helped. Anyway get this game right now! You will NOT be disappointed!",5
"First of all, I want to say how funny the one star reviews are. ‚ÄúGive me Klee or die,‚Äù definitely gave me something to laugh about. 

The game is amazing. Even though I‚Äôve done all the Archon Quests currently available, I still find things to do, like exploring parts of the map I previously ignored.

The updates and events have satisfied me, giving me something to look forward to the next day when I log on. The newest event, Midsummer Island Adventure (I think), is great. I love the fact that if you grind a bit, you can get a beautiful Barbara skin. The Echoing Conchs tell many stories, and the quests about the past people who lived there are captivating. 11/10 Job on the event.

I really don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with Genshin Impact. Some people say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúhomophobic‚Äù that they don‚Äôt have a certain character because they are a certain sexuality. It‚Äôs not about your sexuality, it‚Äôs just the rates. You might get a few more of a certain character because that‚Äôs what the random generator gives you. You‚Äôre not special because you get bad artifacts, plenty of people spend hours grinding for artifacts and get many trashy ones (me included).

Overall, great work. I‚Äôve loved this game from the second I picked it up.",5
"Honestly, this is the most amazing game I have ever found for a phone. I need this to have a contract with Nintendo or something so I can play on a larger screen! 

The world is MASSIVE. The gameplay has its complications, but that is to be expected considering it‚Äôs played on a phone screen. Aside from that, it‚Äôs easy to navigate how the game works. Gameplay is smooth (I have had a few freezes but closing and reopening the app brings me right back to where I froze, no lost gameplay!). 

The graphics are beautiful. Character designs at unique. Voice overs are smooth and sound great. The quests are easy to understand and follow. I do wish there was a bit more of a tutorial, but it was pretty easy to figure out on my own. Still wrapping my head around what elemental power beats what but I‚Äôm sure the internet has the answer.",5
"This is definitely one of my favorite games, the characters, the graphics, all of it is great. I spend so much time playing it its insane- but, i do have some problems with it.. the game tends to crash randomly if i open anything, like checking my inventory, my characters, the map, etc. idk if this is because of my phone or something with the game. Another thing is i spent days getting to AR 18 to continue the main quest, but while heading to stormterror‚Äôs lair I realized i had things to collect in mondstadt. So when i collected those things and headed back the barrier was back up for some reason, and i couldn‚Äôt get it to go back how it was before. So now i can‚Äôt continue the main story. I would appreciate if you could fix this or give me some advice so i could continue with the main story quests.",5
"Genshin Impact is an absolutely phenomenal rpg. All the hard work put into it really shows! The graphics are outstanding and the sorry line as well as the game play do not have words that can properly describe how amazing this game is. Not to mention the background music!
Although I can‚Äôt say that this game is without some false considering that nothing is perfect. Whenever the game is updated my BP level resets from its current level to zero once again. This happened with the last update and the newest one as well. I cannot say that this is happening to everyone as I have not seen anyone else mention this happening to them. Aside from this I do not regret to inform you that there are no other qualms I have with this addicting game.  I cannot wait to continue to play this breathtaking rpg!",5
"This game is stunning! The game graphics and voice acting is beautiful. I don‚Äôt really mind that this a gacha game, the items you use to buy weapons and characters aren‚Äôt that hard to get if you just play the game. I play a mobile and the playing experience isn‚Äôt that great sometimes. Whenever I go to see all of my characters the game crashes. It also crashes when I teleport and when I go to quick team setup. Also, when there is a story on screen it lags a little bit and glitches. When it does that I have to leave the game and reopen it for it to work smoothly again. If you are looking to download this game, I‚Äôd encourage you to. Just be aware of all of the bugs on mobile. I think that this game would be perfect if mobile was a little more friendly. Overall, this game is worth your time.",5
"For a mobile phone game, this is phenomenal.

Hell, even for a console or PC game, the open world experience is very immersive and captivating. 

The gameplay is solid, and although it incorporates more traditional gacha-style game progression, it does so in a way that isn‚Äôt too obnoxious. You can easily progress whether you spend real currency or not.

A lot of the fun for me is in the story and the gameplay. It‚Äôs surprisingly good story and character voice-overs will keep you entertained, as an RPG should.

My biggest complaint is probably that is just a bit too open world, and there aren‚Äôt too many activities to keep your interest for more than an hour or two at a time. This is a fine game to help you relax, but as a grind, it can be kind of boring. 

There is a lot of ambition to this game, and I can‚Äôt wait to see just what they plan to release in the upcoming months, especially in terms of multiplayer. For what it‚Äôs worth, there is a lot to do right now, and I recommend diving in now while it is so popular. 

To summarize, it‚Äôs among the top 5 most gorgeous mobile games you can play. Cross-platform, and very little bugs and gameplay issues, but you will spend a lot of time exploring and wandering the big open-world, so be prepared for a lot of silence and atmosphere.",5
"I have been following this game for quite some time now and now that I can finally play it, I can say proudly I am not disappointed. This game is fantastic even on mobile, though the small controls are a bit hard to get used to. Still this game performs well and looks amazing. My only problem with this his game is the gacha rates. They are extremely low and you would have to spend $200 for a pity pull and that‚Äôs not even guaranteed that you would get a 5 star character and could just be a 5 star weapon. There needs to be some tweak to the gacha system or even increase the rates at this point. Other than the bad gacha rates this game is fun and honestly you don‚Äôt need 5 star characters to beat endgame content, 4 star heroes perform just as well as long you have pulled multiple of them to ascend them.",5
"First of all, I love this game! The graphics, the story, the characters, everything. But I only have three suggestions. The first suggestion is about wishes. I work so hard to earn primo gems, but when I get to 10 intertwined wishes, I only get weapons. It‚Äôs rare for me to even get one new character! Could you guys just make it easier for players to get characters? Please change this! Another suggestion is that players can get boats. I keep on trying to get to islands in the sea, but it takes wayyyyy too long with my Cryo characters. If we (players) got boats in the game, it could be more exciting! And maybe some times along the way, the players could meet sea monsters! This is an awesome game and I really recommend it, but again, also just some suggestions. Have a great day!",5
"Genshin Impact is a fun and immersive RPG that features beautiful scenery and extremely detailed characters. The storyline is interesting and deep for once in a gacha RPG, and MiHoYo releases new characters, events, and free rewards fairly often which helps keep the playing experience interesting. There‚Äôs only one problem with the game, and it‚Äôs a fairly large one and that is the sheer size of the thing. On a beefy pc or console, this game is absolutely stunning. Mobile devices, however, simply don‚Äôt contain the processing power or storage to keep up with the constant updates, high graphics, and unbelievably large map. It is definitely not recommended that you get the game on a mobile device, but instead install it on a computer or console via the Epic Games Store. The game itself is great and addictive, even; it just does not have a place in the world of mobile, pocket-sized, less powerful devices.   Basically, get the game and play it; despite its ‚Äúanime/waifu/husbando‚Äù outlook in the gaming world‚Ä¶. just not on a mobile device.",1
"This game is really fun I love the characters and the setting, but it asked for an update and I let. It said it would notify me when it‚Äôs done but‚Ä¶ it did not so I checked the game and it looked like it was almost done but it refreshed it all the way to the start of the download for the SECOND time!!!!!! Can someone help please bc the The download or update takes years exaggeration but it takes a date and it always refreshes it I think this might be because I don‚Äôt have enough gigabytes but I restored mine and I I didn‚Äôt warn but it still says the same thing anyways besides that it‚Äôs a really really good game and if you download it and you don‚Äôt have any problems then this isn‚Äôt for you but if other people have problems with an update I want to know just so I know it‚Äôs not just me anyways really good game would prescribe it",4
"Please implement a pity system for artifacts. It‚Äôs very tedious to grind for an ideal artifact. With each character requiring different type of artifacts, I feel very discouraged to draw more new characters. This is especially true for the most recent update. I thought that‚Äôll I‚Äôll find the fire I had when I first played Genshin. However, I soon was reminded how frustrating the artifact system is. I don‚Äôt feel Genshin as it is right now will keep me. The system can be as simple as re-rolling the  primary stat of each artifacts. I‚Äôve been playing a new game called tower of fantasy(ToF), and I really like some of its mechanics. ToF is not as a good game as Genshin, but their pity system reflects what a gacha game should have. I don‚Äôt mind spending tons of money for C6 chars(I already have), but I do not like to spend 2-3 weeks for one single ideal artifacts. I know I am not alone in this.  Please do something, I don‚Äôt want to give up on genshin.",3
"Hoyoverse has disappointed many including myself with the launch of sumeru and it‚Äôs cast of orientalist designs and mostly pale characters. They enjoy using the aesthetics of real southwest Asian and North African cultures, but don‚Äôt bother to represent the real people who live in those regions. I was planning on spending money on this game until I saw what a disappointment sumeru was going to be. Hopefully they‚Äôll have learned their lesson before Natlan. But I doubt it. They‚Äôre extremely colorist, with their darkest character barely tan. Candace, who was based off a real woman, Kandake, is an extreme letdown to fans who were hoping to see a dark skinned woman represented  in game. In summation, hoyoverse is egregiously wrong to inaccurately lump these distinct and beautiful cultures into one mishmashed  amalgamation and then not even represent the people from those cultures. Some may say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just a fantasy game!‚Äù Why is it that people of darker skin tones aren‚Äôt allowed in that fantasy then. What is so ‚Äúunrealistic ‚Äú about melanin that characters can‚Äôt be dark skinned?",1
"Okay to start off, i like the game. Im not hating on it for no reason. It is well put together and the stories are okay. But thats not the point. The problem at hand is the constant lack of diversity. Incase you didnt know, teyvat is made up of 7 different nations that are all based on real-life nations. One of the nations is called sumeru, and is based on south asia countries like India, Pakistan, and other countries in or near that region. As you might already know, lots of the people who live there have a daker complexion/skin tone than say someone from the UK. It has been leaked that 99% of the characters have a light skin complexion. Not to mention that in total of all of the current playable characters only 2 of them are a little darker while the rest are pale or slightly tan. Its quite a problem since there is already a lack of diversity in genshins cast. Again, genshin is a great game. It just disappoints the community after we constantly ask Hoyoverse to add more dark skin characters. 

Thats it ciao :')",2
"This game might look like a cheap Breath of the Wild Free-to-Play, but it is honestly anything but. I downloaded this game on a whim and was fully ready to uninstall it as soon as it bored me, but after hours of gameplay I can say that I was wrong and this game is actually very fun. The play-loop is very engaging, I don‚Äôt feel the need to spend a cent on this game, and I honestly feel overwhelmed by the amount of items I receive and I wish there were less rewards lol the only downside I can think of is the amount of items you receive make all of the menu‚Äôs constantly have notifications lmaoooo it‚Äôs super fun and is super engaging, but if you‚Äôre looking for something to itch the scratch that BOTW left you, this is not the game for you. It is so very different in every way besides the aesthetics, just give it a chance and see.",4
"Look, this game is great. The graphics are‚Ä¶okay on mobile. But we need more content in this game. These updates have been lowkey kind of boring and we need a sort of endgame mechanic or anything that will not make us bored of this game. Also, with the upcoming region Sumeru coming out, I except there to be representation for the culture of where Sumeru is based off of. It‚Äôs not that hard to do, it‚Äôs a simple request. Also, you guys NEED to try and shrink the app size. You will lose more players each patch if you don‚Äôt. Our storages cannot handle that much. Again, this is a request that many people would like to see. Thank you.

Also, when I mean representation I mean not stereotyping characters. I also mean adding more diversity. Yes, there can be white colored skin tones but not everyone should be white skinned. People want representation of their own culture, and you not giving them their representation will force them to not play your game. So please, read this and the many other reviews. This is very disappointing Hoyoverse.",1
"the company, hoyoverse, only cares about money and not their customers satisfaction. they already have billions of dollars yet are thirsty for more. the currency used to pull for characters gets way too hard to get after you reach a certain level. the game has multiple regions, and the upcoming region, sumeru, is supposed to be based off of an area with primarily dark skinned people, yet they‚Äôve only made 3-4 characters that are slightly tanner than paper-white in the whole GAME. they represented other cultures, like china, japan, and germany nearly flawlessly, yet their idea of representation for the middle east and south asia is completely stereotypical. the only tan characters that genshin has included have ALL been 4*s, and it‚Äôs easy to realize that hoyoverse is making these characters a lower tier than the others because they think that they won‚Äôt get as many sales as the light-skinned characters. the company doesn‚Äôt even care about keeping people interested, and more fishing people of their money.",1
"When it comes to mondstadt, Hoyoverse focuses on one country/culture for inspiration. (Germany) When it comes to liyue, Hoyoverse focuses on one country/culture. (China) When it comes to inazuma, Hoyoverse focuses on one country/culture. (Japan) But when it comes to sumeru, all of the sudden the SWANA region (which all have unique and significant cultures) gets meshed together into a single monolith. Not to mention the sumeru characters are all either stereotypes, orientalist, or just straight up have no resemblance to a SWANA culture. Another issue is the fact that there are no dark skinned sumeru characters or NPC‚Äôs. I am well aware that people come in all different shades and some SWANA countries have people that are fair-skinned but that still does not excuse the fact that the majority of people from the SWANA region are tan, brown, black, etc. It‚Äôs really disappointing for Hoyoverse to put love and care into each nation in the game and pay very careful attention to each culture but when it comes to a predominantly brown country/culture they just become lazy and ignorant. Do better.",1
"Hey! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
I‚Äôve been playing genshin for almost a year now and throughout my experience I have some things to share: ‚ö°Ô∏è
1. ‚ú®You don‚Äôt have to spend money on the game to have a good time.‚ú® I personally do spend money sparingly on this game, however you do NOT have to to still have a great experience. I understand many people would rather not spend money on a free game or simply cannot and that is perfectly okay!
2. üíñTake your time with the story!üíñ You don‚Äôt have to rush through the gameplay to get to ‚Äúendgame‚Äù because you will soon realize you missed out on a great and enjoyable story. 
3. üéáDon‚Äôt compare your account to other people‚Äôs. üéáLet me explain, Genshin Impact has a team and character building aspect to its gameplay and it is very easy to see other people‚Äôs characters in action and feel not good enough. 
4. ü™©Don‚Äôt play extensively. ü™©This game is very easy to get burnout from. It‚Äôs not a bad game in proportion but if you spend hours upon hours playing it gets a bit boring. I know from experience. 

Overall it‚Äôs a great game and I definitely recommend it if you enjoy lore, game combat,  lovable characters, and beautiful scenery. If any of those things speak to you download the game. Trust me ;)",5
"The largest problem of this game in my opinion is the gatcha system implemented and the normalization of this system in the industry as a whole. Genshin impact has been one of the most influential games this past year with everyone being inside and due to the pandemic, and subsequently trying and playing new games, Genshin has thrived in this new gaming industry with a astronomical 2 billion dollars made from mobile platforms through in app purchases. While the game may be free to play, and many of the players being ftp, the effort put into making scummy mechanics and having many of your favorite characters locked behind unrealistic odds of obtaining, limited time availability, on top of the egregious odds of pulling said character or weapon. It‚Äôs just culminates into a horrible system of unlocking new characters, and thereby having ‚Äúfun‚Äù in this game. While I have no qualms with the actual gameplay and the overall world in this, it is largely overshadowed by the gatcha system.",2
"Why am I getting bad artifacts? Is there some sort of pattern? Cause when I wanted the event character (eula) I actually got good artifacts. Ended up losing the 50/50. I‚Äôm not mad about losing it. I‚Äôm mad, and wanted to say why now? Why on the event character, that I‚Äôve wanted for some time now. I know it happens to everyone, and when I speak on the behalf of everyone else who struggles in the game. This is their main issue. Artifacts are never good, Barely and primogems from out HARDWORK, and losing the 50/50 during the times we get good artifacts for them. And I don‚Äôt even know if this is real, but is there such thing as streamers luck? Just because they play your game, for everyone to show? Practically advertising it? You give them good stuff, which honestly makes me jealous. I‚Äôm not a streamer. But I work really hard in Genshin. Part of my life is on this app. Hopefully you read this, to see what I‚Äôve been feeling about the game so far. I‚Äôd like to see your feedback.",2
"So this is my fav game and I had been playing this all day and I actually download it when it just come out and at first I don‚Äôt really know what to do in it so I haven‚Äôt been playing this for like almost one year and then I went in to see it again and started to playing for 1 week and then I got bored but this time I known a lot of this game now it is amazing! So some characters is really cute! Like qiqi, Klee, Diona, Sayu, Barbara, Xianling, Hu tao, and Kokomi and maybe more but I can‚Äôt remember, and also even know I only Barbara, Sayu, Xianling but I hope I will get them one day! And I‚Äôm at adventure rank 25 and I‚Äôm stuck at the ascension quest so I had watched a lot of videos of how to do it, and I haven‚Äôt try it so I think I can! And that is all what I can think about this game for now, btw ThIs GaMe Is AmAzInG!",5
"Genshin Impact is a great game! I absolutely love the graphics of it. The scenery is so well done it blows my mind. The character design is great and the story is phenomenal. I do have a couple of suggestions though. I ask that maybe primogems came in bigger quantities, because, I know that grinding to get Kokomi was really hard. I lost 50/50 because I got Kequing. So because I didn‚Äôt get her I‚Äôm pretty sad. Maybe the next pull after a fifty fifty would be the five star of the limited banner? And maybe the four stars that you got wouldn‚Äôt repeat so much? I got Bediou, Xingqu, and Rosaria. But not Kokomi. I haven‚Äôt been on in a day, and I‚Äôm writing this as it updates. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make Kokomi stay in Wanderlust Location!!!!!!!!!! I suggested this game to everyone Ik, and I think it‚Äôs amazing an needs more attention! That‚Äôs all!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing the game since release and this past month has been a slap to the face. Raiden and Beidou can‚Äôt work in a team comp at all and we‚Äôre falsely advertised for raiden to work with her. Kokomis kit is a complete joke for a 5 star, and the way they have handled criticism of their game is laughable. Anyone that speaks out about it has their comment deleted deemed a ‚Äúbot‚Äù. I have tried to leave a 1 star review multiple times and each time it has been deleted. I guess when someone speaks out about a game treating their player base poorly they‚Äôre a ‚Äúbot‚Äù. Do better mihoyo. You can spend 10 million + on Twitter hashtags, but can‚Äôt make an anniversary that keeps players engaged and wanting to play? Good luck keeping a paying player base.",5
"Ok so, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the game, the story line, everything. There‚Äôs just one thing, why are there so many female characters? And now the dendro archon is a woman too,(at least I think) so out of all the archons 2 ARE MALES. This really gets under my skin. Personally I like woman and men but really? It‚Äôs coming to the point where it‚Äôs getting annoying we‚Äôve had 1 new male character and that is Kazuha, and 5 new female characters. As of right now there are 26 girls and 12 boys. That‚Äôs an enormous ratio. I seriously don‚Äôt get why? What about all the people who have a preference for men and like playing as male characters? It doesn't make any sense. I know I‚Äôm not the only one bothered by this. As someone who likes to play as male characters at least make one more archon a boy. Like please? I mean I was happy with 3 archons being boys and 4 being girls, but now it‚Äôs 2 boys and 5 girls. There‚Äôs literally double the amount of playable characters that are girls than boys, why make the dendro archon a girl too?. üòê",2
"This game is amazing! :) The worldbuilding is spectacular, and the plot is amazing. You, a Traveller from another world, gets separated from their sibling and goes on an epic quest around a magic world? That‚Äôs so cool! The characters are so cool, and marvelously detailed. The graphics, even on a mobile device, are actually amazing! Not to mention the gacha aspect, which puts luck when getting characters and weapons for the game! This game does take up a lot of storage, but it‚Äôs much worth it in my opinion. If you enjoy fantasy, open world, RPGs, gacha rolling, and/or magic, this game is for you! Huge credit to Mihoyo for making such an amazing game!!

Edit: Since writing this, so many spectacular updates have come out! Seriously, this is a top-notch game. Anyone and everyone should give it a play, you won‚Äôt be dissatisfied!",5
"I absolutely love this game. The amazing visuals, the complex and intriguing storyline, I love it! I know this game is originally meant to be played on console (I think, I just know that is wasn‚Äôt originally created for mobile), but there‚Äôs an issue that happens a lot to other mobile users. Sometimes when I start up the app, it just gets stuck on the title screen that says ‚ÄúGenshin Impact.‚Äù Sometimes, when i actually get past that screen, the game crashes before I can even start playing! I know, it‚Äôs on mobile and mobile doesn‚Äôt usually work as smoothly as console does, but it would be really, REALLY helpful to play a game that doesn‚Äôt crash every time you teleport somewhere. I would‚Äôve given the game the 5-stars it deserves, but I‚Äôm giving it a 4-star because of this lagging issue. It would be really helpful if you read this, thanks!",4
"This is the only gacha style mobile game i have continuously play from time to time and I only dropped off from it once as with other gacha games you dont really get to truly control the characters you play and thats just one of the many problems genshin fixes its not just some same collect the card game style of gacha it took triple a elements of gameplay and added the gacha elements on top of it alot of people say that Genshin is really grindy but they give you awsome characters to start off with who are actually really powerful and I can attest to that since a Chinese player beat all floors of the spiral abyss with only damage and dodging, maybe American companies need to take notes from Mihoyo and actually make a game and not just a copy paste battle royale over and over",5
"Genuinely such a beautiful game. I usually don‚Äôt write reviews but honestly I just had to. There is only a few things I think need to be fixed with this.

 1. So in the beginning of the game after the story u are on the island with the first anemo statue so when I got on that island and my traveler used the wind power from the statue I kept killing slimes but I had no idea what to do bc I kept killing slimes. I think you need to include more details bc I deleted the game probably 2 times bc I couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

2. It‚Äôs kinda annoying to have specific dates for domains. I have to wait to do the domain bc there is specific days you can do it. 

3. I think there should be a better way to get weapons because I just got Hu Tao and don‚Äôt have a weapon for her. There is 2 weapons to craft for her and they do not apply with any use to her. 

Other than some minor things that aren‚Äôt important this game is amazing and I do recommend it. Now ur gonna crash and ur gonna lag on mobile. But that‚Äôs because it is a pc game. But honestly for a game on mobile the graphics are amazing. 

Also I wanna say in the beginning on the island this is how to do it 

Kill slimes then there is a button (ultimate attack) next to ur special attack u need to use that then u can leave the island. üíóüéâ",5
"So most people already probably say this. It‚Äôs really hard for f2p players to save up primogems. There just aren‚Äôt that many opportunities unless you save up for months. If they could maybe make it a little bit easier to get characters or primogems then that‚Äôd be great. Resin is a big part of the game. I run out really easily so perchance could you make the things that require resin well require less resin? I don‚Äôt have much complaints. Oh, for me there isn‚Äôt much to do in the game. Once your out of resin and you did your daily commissions then there‚Äôs basically nothing left for me to do. I try exploring but when I do there aren‚Äôt things that give primogems. Please please make it easier to farm for them. I appreciate that they took one of my suggestions in the new update. The being able to communicate with others and seeing when people are online is amazing and again, I love that they incorporated that.",3
"Third review, more complaining. This time, it‚Äôs with stormterror. Idk how anyone is supposed to beat the boss without being able to see anything. I can‚Äôt see anything and I‚Äôve been fighting him multiple times for about half an hour. However, there was one time when I could see a red indicator showing it might be close but it went away fast. I still also can‚Äôt see the cutscenes and part of the background is dark. I hope this is fixed soon so that no more players suffer the way that some other players including myself have endured. If it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm using an iPad Air 2, then why allow the game to be downloaded on it, if it‚Äôs a ruined version of this amazing game? It‚Äôs not the only device that carries the issue though, I have tried playing this on my iPhone 6 to see if it would be better but instead the game kept crashing so I‚Äôll never know.",4
"For a game that asks you to invest time, effort, and if you want to, money.... a lot of it for some people... the account security is just pitiful, I have seen so many cases of hacks in this game that it makes me scared to spend money or co-op at all. Please please please Mihoyo, fix this. There isn‚Äôt even two factor authentification, which is like the bare minimum security in my opinion. Please show us you care. It makes me sad and paranoid seeing so many people losing their AR 40+ accounts and having to start new after spending even thousands of dollars on their hacked account, thinking they would be safe to do so. Please improve the security, that is literally all I ask. I just want to rest easy knowing my account that I invested so much into isn‚Äôt going to be so easily taken from me.",5
"The game design is amazing, the progression is just right for all levels of video game players low-medium, the graphics are perfect in every way, the music is super chill and when u get into a adventure or battle scene the music turns into either a semi-tense semi-adventurous music, and I overall love the game. But anything with that much godliness must have something wrong with it, the game has a mega download file and it will run through battery levels, getting four star heroes is fairly easy but getting more than one five star hero is almost impossible unless you pay or put in a lot of time and effort, which I‚Äôm not saying is a bad thing because the five stars are very powerful so it makes sense for them to be rare, I have t even gotten one lol. But overall I absolutely am in love with this game!",5
"So I‚Äôm gonna be honest I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this game. A friend suggested it so I downloaded it and started playing. I got addicted to playing even though I enjoy multiplayer more than single player. There are many great characters you can play with, and all have their own unique abilities. The only complaint i have is I would like to hear our main character‚Äôs voice in cutscenes, but otherwise its a great game limited at times, but amazing fun. There is puzzles to elemental reactions as well as a crafting and cooking system. Not everyone might agree with me, but i suggest just trying it out for yourself. They also added an multiplayer system you just have to get through a certain bit of the game first. Well anyways neat game and I‚Äôll continue to enjoy it even if I‚Äôm stuck on mobile version of the game.",5
"I don‚Äôt know what engine this game is using but it is definitely not well optimized. At least please support different rendering options. For previous iPhone you can lower down the graphics resolution as well as details such as shadows and renderings such as water and grass. I saw the minimum requirement is iPhone 8 and I thought I can give a try on my iPhone 7 and it just crashed after every 10 minutes, especially during a combat or walking inside a large city. I do like the big open world and stories but many other open world games are much more smoother than this. Please consider adding adaptivity to different phones and make it faster. At least for me if the game is running smoothly I can tolerate some level of graphics quality. Otherwise it‚Äôs just too annoying when the game crashes. Actually I can run most of other RPG games in the App Store without any problem using my iPhone 7 but this one is just so hard to play without suffering from lagging.",1
"I‚Äôm playing this game on an iPad Pro, and the game is in bad need of controller support.  As it is, the game is difficult to play simply because the on-screen controls are uncomfortable on a large screen.  For a game which involves platforming and aiming and which also has a PC port and a PS4 port, ignoring controller support is inexcusable.  Hopefully, this will be patched in soon -this would warrant a few more stars for this review.

The gacha system for obtaining new allies is brutal - some of the lowest rates you‚Äôll find (0.6% for a 5*).  They don‚Äôt seem to be super generous with currency at the moment, so you should go into the game expecting to be playing with the story-provided characters and one or two other 4* characters unless you commit to whaling.

The game occasionally decides it wants to take several minutes to load (on a white screen), so if that happens to you, you probably just need to wait a few more minutes before trying to restart the game.  It doesn‚Äôt happen EVERY time you load the game, but I‚Äôve encountered this several times so far.  Bug?

Frustrating controls and brutal gacha aside, the game looks very good for a gacha game and is actually fun when you‚Äôre not wrestling with the clunky controls.  To me, the game feels more like Sword Art Online: Lost Song for the PlayStation Vita than anything else - right down to the flying in Lost Song and ‚Äúsingle player MMO-like‚Äù feel that all the Vita SAO games had.",2
"I have been playing this game for 2 years and I just now got a five star character. While my friend has been playing for way less time and has gotten 3 five stars. I think the wish system should be less random, and there should be a wishlist on which character you want so you have a higher chance of getting that character. I also think it should be easier to get primo gems, or make the wishes cost less primo gems. Also, you should be able to get guaranteed characters if you pay. Say five dollars for a four star, and 10 dollars for a five star? I just think the wish system is very flawed and need to be reviewed. Other than that the game is great! Honestly it is my favorite mobile game, and the only problem is the wish system (which is unfortunately a big problem.))",4
"I really like this game. I play it with my friends, the story is great and so are the graphics. Over all a really nice game. The one thing I have to complain about is how much storage it takes upüíÄ. You have to delete almost half the apps you have downloaded on your phone, most of your pictures, and MAYBE you‚Äôll be able to load your resource data after an update. It‚Äôs ridiculous. It takes an hour and a half to update the game and like 30 minutes to load the resources and right at the end it warns you that you don‚Äôt have enough storage!? Storage for what? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm storing a missile in my files. Roblox takes like 8 seconds to update and it has more stuff than Genshin Impact ever will.
All I am saying is that Genshin needs to fix how big their games are and how much storage they take up, it‚Äôs a good game I just think that the storage issue is silly.",3
"Dude‚Ä¶ Genshin impact is like if animal crossing, standard battle game, and amazing graphics all had a kid and then enhanced times a thousand. It‚Äôs amazing. BEAUTIFUL graphics, a massive world to explore, a ton of characters, and so much more for FREE makes it an easy best-of-all-time. It‚Äôs not even pay to win, you can ofc pay for primos and things, but it‚Äôs definitely not required or needed to advance. The character designs are immaculate, and the whole concept of the game is just brilliant. I‚Äôm not at a high AR, about 25 or so, so my quests are piled up pretty high at the moment‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve heard that higher ARs don‚Äôt get many quests/things to do though‚Ä¶ but with the new update i think things will get better! If the devs keep up the spectacular work, and use fan input, this game could become even better than it alr is. :)",5
"I had 3 masterless starglitter and got a four star, which is supposed to give you 2 more starglitter,  which would have given me 7, enough to wish again, but I didn‚Äôt get any more starglitter from that wish. To add to that, I was doing the spiral abyss, and got 3 ‚Äú50 primos‚Äù messages after doing floor 9 which would have given me 150. After that, without checking my primo amount, I did floor eight so I could get the one star from chamber two that I hadn‚Äôt gotten yet, and I got 100 primos for that. In total, even if I‚Äôd started from 0 primogems, which I didn‚Äôt, I would have had at the very least 250 primogems, but by the end of that I still only had 179, and I‚Äôd started from 29 primogems. I hope Mihoyo fixes and recompensates us for these problems.",5
"Okay, so I‚Äôm not usually one for mobile games but after a few recommendations thought I‚Äôd give this one a shot. I came in expecting to be disappointed but now I can not stress enough how much fun this game is! The story is fun to play along with, defeating bosses is challenging but not impossible, and the graphics are shockingly good considering it‚Äôs a mobile game. I would have given it five stars were it not so hard to obtain five star characters. The wishing system in this game is designed so that you have to spend real money if you want to get strong playable characters. However, even spending $100 will only get you about 40 wishes which sound fine until you consider that there is a .6 percent chance of actually getting one of those great five star characters. But other than the absurd impossibility of the wishing system, this game is addicting and I would absolutely recommend it.",4
"This game is pretty good! I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs free without a bunch of ads and pay-to-win stuff everywhere. Any other app would lock stories, features or characters behind money locks where you must pay, but everything is free and gives you sooo much to do. Very pretty world and nice character design. The mechanics are easy enough on all platforms but I just have 1 complaint: the stamina. It‚Äôs a bit low, youre average human can swim/run/climb for more than 20 seconds. Especially swimming, I drown when Im in the middle of a lake. Also, I dont think there should be stamina while gliding, the glider is doing all the work. Unless different gliders have longer stamina? It‚Äôs not much of a complaint, it doesnt get in the way of gameplay. I dont have much complaints for this. Good job, 10/11",5
"The game is great. Well, at least for the first few weeks of gameplay. Good graphics, interesting story, entertaining characters. So why am I giving it a 1 star review? Terrible updates, painfully annoying gacha system that only works out of pure luck (you could pay hundreds and thousands of dollars and it would never guarantee an item you‚Äôd want to get), and don‚Äôt even get me started on the recent anniversary ‚Äúevents‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt even get a special character or interesting new storyline. There are other things too, such as random glitches, horrible fishing system, overly difficult quests and tasks that give no hints as to what you‚Äôre supposed to do, excruciatingly long amounts of unnecessary and uninteresting dialogue, and unending cycles of spending hours and hours just to buy a single wish, only for it to be another 3 star sword that you already have. So in summary, if you want to have a few weeks of fun, then eventually realize that the game is just not all that great, go for it.",1
"I cannot in good faith recommend new players get addicted to this game for the last two reasons. I will update this review if developers actually listen to feedback. Reasons as follows:

This is game is gorgeous from it‚Äôs art to its music, and it is a technological achievement that it can fit on your phone and still be as expansive and open world as it is. The characters are all memorable and lovable, the combat is very colorful snd fun, and the story and lore are very interesting too. 

The developers will not listen to your suggestions though and will even try to censor you on their social media platforms that allow it, so don‚Äôt expect any improvements. The game will also try to milk you of every penny you‚Äôre worth with tempting mechanics such as getting resources faster, getting characters you want more often, and of course making your characters stronger which can cost you upwards of thousands in USD. But worst of all the studio will use community artists and cosplayers as advertising and pay them little no compensation in exchange. This behavior is a complete 180¬∞ shift from when the game first launched, showing that now that they‚Äôve made money they no longer care about the players.

So once again, I do not recommend this game. It‚Äôs a highly addictive time waster. But if you don‚Äôt care about being mistreated and you have deep pockets to burn, by all means play away. I just think your money can be better spent elsewhere.",1
"The game is amazing. I love it but there are too many things i dont like. I wish that it didnt take up so much room. Every time i want to play i have to delete almost all my apps just to play. Also i dont like how you can only get 5 wishes per month. Its annoying and I wish the app would also give diversity when getting wishes. I keep getting the same items and its annoying, also it crashes sometimes too. Back to the diversity thing, its annoying when i get 5 debate clubs in a row. Also I wish the tasks where easier, as in the instructions. I had to watch a video just to figure out the in the mountains task bc it was so hard to understand what I had to do. I still havent completed the full task bc of how hard it is to stay warm and fight the bosses on a time limit. I do love this game, its fun and has many great adventures but there are too many difficulties to enjoy it too the fullest",3
"The graphics are amazing and the storyline is very entertaining. I used to think that higher drop rates were needed, until I realized that it was easier to get five stars by doing one times wishes. At least for me.  It might take more wishes, but it is much more convenient than saving up and doing one ten roll only to get a very low chance of a five star. Plus, getting 160 primogems is much easier than getting 1,600 primos. I usually just spend the primogems when I get them, unless new characters are making a debut in a new update; for example 1.5. 
Many of the features are like Zelda, but what is most important is always the storyline, and the fact that the rpg game is free. I never paid this game once, and I don‚Äôt think I will need to.",5
"Super fun. I recommend watching a few tips for beginners when you start so you know the best ways to use your resources. If you play a few hours a day you will level up pretty quickly, however never rush! Spend your time focusing on your current characters and how you can make them stronger ‚Äî rather than leveling up higher because you‚Äôll seriously regret it. The higher your AR rank is, the harder your world level will be. The scenery of this game is beautiful as well as the music for each area. A lot of detail was put into making this game and I really love that. Co-oping is available except for when you do the main story quests and a few world quests. Have fun and don‚Äôt feel obligated to spend!! Save your money and don‚Äôt fall into gacha gambling!!!",5
"So I‚Äôm a beginner with the game so I don‚Äôt know much about it, I had just hit adventure rank 35, and then I did the ascension quest because I thought it was something we had to do, but I didn‚Äôt know it was a optional thing, point is my team isn‚Äôt ready for the bosses that are leveled 60+, now I can‚Äôt even complete a quest because the bosses are too hard and so I can‚Äôt fight bosses to get materials for my characters. I can‚Äôt decrease my level either to fix it so Is there anyway for my to fix it, I deleted the game because I can‚Äôt do anything with it, I couldn‚Äôt start over again but that would take up so much time. 

If there‚Äôs no way to fix this then it‚Äôs ok, it was my mistake I just didn‚Äôt know.
But the game overall is fun and addictive I love it.",5
"Everything else in this game is great from the combat to the exploration even the in game events are a blast. None of these excuse the bad, frustrating, and cheap design of enemies in game. Some hide behind shields all day without engaging the player, and others shoot from range constantly disengaging the player if you go near them or are placed in unreachable locations or will raise themselves up to where you can‚Äôt reach them without aimed shot while taking a barrage of missiles to the face. Finally there are the power armor enemies. These enemies will unleash a flurry of attacks, (or spin to win your face) that will stagger and juggle you in the air meanwhile not caring about your normal or charged attacks. Often these enemies will stay just out of your range until you run out of stamina and then wail on you for free. The best part is they can just back away from you outside of your range while you normal attack them.",3
"I am in love with this game! The graphics are amazing and so far I have had zero lag, it runs smoothly. It reminds me of BOTW, but better. I really love the game mechanics, combat, and exploring. I do wish that there were avatar customization options for the traveler, I‚Äôd love to be able to dress them up and really make them ‚Äúmy‚Äù character. Having event outfits and accessories would add a lot of fun, and more things to collect and work towards. Also mounts to earn and collect would be pretty amazing. I really appreciate that I can play it on my phone and the pc, it is really nice being able to play on two systems. If you like BOTW, beautiful open world exploration, cooking and crafting, collecting characters and unlocking interesting lore and stories, get this game!!! I think anyone that enjoys rpgs will enjoy Genshin Impact.",5
"I would have given this a four and a half star review, but unfortunately thats not possible. I love this game, and realy, I‚Äôve fallen for the undeniably amzing graphics. There are, however, prices to pay for that. While the graphics are wonderful, fully downloading the game takes up about a sixth of my current storage. I‚Äôm unable to download more than a few games at a time in order to keep myself in the range of my overall storage. I believe this is due to the high quality graphics and voicovers.

Other than that, my only complaint is that there is no trade system between non-npc players. I would love to trade characters and food, as well as barter and sell things for in game currency. 

The game also, while having a wonderful friend and co-op system, does not save quest progress in co-op, which is arguably the reason most people quickly obtain it. I know that I worked twice as hard to unlock adventure rank 16 just so I could get help on some of my quests, which ended up being for nearly nothing.

The quests are amazing and captivating, rewarding and fun. I have fun runninv theough temples and solving puzzels in my free time. This game is extremely rewarding, addictive, and fun. From wishing for new characters, to making mushroom skewers, this game has much to offer.",4
"This is honestly the best game ever. The graphics are insane, the Gacha system is perfect, the fighting and combat is amazing, the characters are Fire, and the story and Lore are the best! Many people say this is the rip off version of Zelda, Breath of the Wild, sure, it took some ideas. But then again, fortnight took ideas from Minecraft to! This game is amazing, took a few ideas and made them better! What‚Äôs wrong with that? Anyways, I‚Äôm addicted! I just started Yesterday, and it‚Äôs amazing! I recommend it to someone like me who has nothing to do and enjoys binge playing games, your boredom will be solved, but as we all know ‚ÄúItS nOt GoOd fOr yUo‚Äù So ye. I love this game, I‚Äôm amazed that it‚Äôs free and you can play it on mobile! I have no problems with this game at all! 100% recommend!
(Although it take up a LOT of storage)",5
"Ok so I‚Äôm writing this review out of sheer boredom as the update for 3.1 (i think i lost track tbh) is loading. Umm this game is great if you have the time and patience to play. you will shed many tears as you get multiple debate clubs without an end. USE WAYPOINTS PLZ I DIDNT AND LIFE WAS VERY DIFFICULT. anyways my other tip (it‚Äôs all i could think off i apologize) is to not stress about artifacts until you unlock 4-5 star artifacts just because i did and it was a waste of resin. DONT USE PRIMOGEMS ON RESIN. JUST DONT. save up primos and finish your quests so that life will be easier for you. this game is great it just takes up a lot of storage. so be prepared to delete the random screenshots in your camera roll. that‚Äôs all i have to say just have fun and don‚Äôt go into dragonspine for a bit.
p.s. 80 pity and no 5-star please hoyoverse have mercy ü•≤ü•≤",5
"I‚Äôve been playing ever since last December 

This game is why i made 1 actual friend-
But, my friend and I get frustrated at the commissions and only giving 60 primos. It's most annoying to my friend because shes ftp but I'm a whaleü•≤.
It takes her 3 days to get 1 wish. She wanted Sangonmiya kokomi so badly but she never had enough primos to wish. She gets really frustrated and almost quit but, I love you guys and u guys work really hard for all of this, especially the anime.
My parents say I‚Äôm to obsessed with the game I mean it‚Äôs true I wrote a whole essay on this game- 
I‚Äôm at ar 52 and I have so much content to do, maybe even to much. My friend doesn‚Äôt know that once you get past certain quests you get even better ones.
But I‚Äôm disappointed in the adventure rank rewards. Ar 60 players should at least get a free 10 pull on standard banner or even 1 intertwined. 
Either way, I love the game it‚Äôs so wholesome and it has little fun jokes like paimon is emergency food. I remember getting Ganyu as my first 5 star. She has been my main ever since ar 25.  If I ever start getting bored at the game I immediately think of Ganyu and get sucked back in. Amazing game keep up the good work Hoyoverse! I‚Äôm very exited for the Genshin Animie!",5
"I wasnt gonna write this but some stuff has been really bothering me. Genshin used to be fun but lately its so incredibly boring. All the fans are super toxic and there isnt any good content. Awful costumer service and so much white washing. All of the events are repeats and its just not the same for old players. I stopped playing around yaes banner because the amount of new content was extremely underwhelming. Once you have played the game for a while you have absolutely nothing to do besides run around and play in a bunch of toxic co-ops. Lately i‚Äôve been mad about the genshin fans going into the TOF reviews and rating it a 1 without a good reason except for the fact it copied genshin acting like genshin isnt a total copy of botw. If you actually played the game you would realize that its just a better version of genshin. Its more f2p friendly, has character customization, its an mmo, with way cooler content with a bunch of awards like multiple wishes and free nitro. The genshin fans are so annoying and the game totally fell off.",1
"This game is trash. After 2 full years of trying to love this game, it‚Äôs only failed me miserably. The developers don‚Äôt fix issues other than nerfing characters that you worked hard/paid for. Whats the point in nerfing a single player game? Idk‚Ä¶They don‚Äôt value your time or money. You get half a pull per day doing dailies and your drops are still terrible at the latest of the stages of the game. There is hardly any coop and quests simply don‚Äôt work in Coop mode. Additionally, enemies get scaled to become much more difficult without any increase in loot in coop. Save your life and money. I‚Äôm considered a pretty moderate whale because I‚Äôve invested my time and money into getting the things I‚Äôve wanted in this game In hopes for more. However,  after all these countless hours and honestly money invested, I can finally say that the developers are greedy and only want you to spend, spend, and spend. If they ban me for this review, I will charge back my card as it was false advertising.",1
"Genshin impact is a great game. It‚Äôs pretty good for people that has gambling addiction hahah. I am very grateful for the free rewards and how it‚Äôs f2p (free to play) friendly. 
Why not a five star rating review? It‚Äôs because sometimes the game can be frustrating. 
The artifact and wishing system is great and all, but I have a little complaint. 
Artifact system: it‚Äôs good and makes perfect sense, but why not give the players a gadget (that we can get from an event) that lets us have better rolls? For example, I want an artifact to roll into crit damage. I will equip the gadget, then the screen will be my inventory. I will need to click on the artifact that I want to roll into crit damage. After I click the artifact then press ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù, the next roll will roll into crit damage. 
Wishing system: sometimes it can be really disappointing‚Ä¶ like losing the 50/50. I lost the 50/50 with every character. Why not lower the hard pity to 80? It can be easier (because we free to plays don‚Äôt have much primogems haha) and more exciting to roll. The weapon banner system is really‚Ä¶ not free to play friendly. How about make the weapon banner‚Äôs system just like the character banner‚Äôs system? 
Sorry for the long review. I recommend you play this game if you have lots of free time or want something to motivate you.",4
"Listen. Genshin Impact is a great game. The devs made it possible so everyone could play this game for free. IMAGINE if it were a paid game and cost money.  I‚Äôm not saying that Genshin Anniversary rewards are bad (10 fate yayy), I am a F2P player and I appreciate everything they have done for the players. So, anyone who‚Äôs saying that the anniversary rewards are bad, JUST PLS STOP IK THE REWARDS ARE STINGY BUT MIHOYO DOESNT HAVE TO GIVE US ANYTHING. So, there you have it, all players can enjoy the open world with any character and even the 4 star characters are good if you level them up. So, personally I think everyone should stop complaining and appreciate what they have (and what they are getting). MIHOYO, thanks for creating Genshin Impact, but if you skimp too much on anniversary rewards, it will affect the players point of view and give them the wrong idea. Pls take this into consideration.",4
"FIRST, i am a paying player.
very generous and very happy to support good developers.

MUCH about this game is simply amazing...
next gen AAA title for tablets and phones.
graphics 10
audio 10
combat 10
characters and voice acting 10
design and polish 10 
controls 8 (need controller support on tablets)
story and events 8 (lots to do, much repetitive)
crafting 6 (simple, but useful)

game is ideal for those that just want to explore!
VERY large world, good story, cool characters!
...
Sadly, the shine does wear off soon...
the 'oh look... found another tree' gets old quick.
customization 0 (does not exist)
loot 0 (100% of loot is ingredient, no useful equipment)
armor 0 (does not exist)
weapons 0 (100% of weapons looted are junk... ingredients)
skills 4 (each character only 2 skills, no skill trees. 6 perks to unlock but require duplicate characters.)
...
for me, after a while the lack of loot and meaningful rewards hurts ... 
LOTS to explore, NOTHING worth finding. 
virtually everything you get as loot is either trash or ingredients... there is no real 'loot'. 
game DESPERATELY needs better loot/rewards.
SPECIALLY at mid to high levels.
make exploration FUN and REWARDING... not pointless.
add some randomized ""useful"" loot in the world. (ie 4 star min).
add weapons with 'effects' or bonus stats to the world.
add some minor cosmetic items to earn or find.",4
"It‚Äôs a great game with good graphics, but it‚Äôs disappointing. Incredibly hard for F2P (free to play) players to get enough Primogems to get characters. The rewards for reaching AR 50 and up are incredibly unfair considering how long it takes to level up. The resin system is slow and it takes way too long to raise characters and weapons due to that. Daily commissions and the Welkin pass don‚Äôt even equal one wish a day. The company is also terrible at communicating with their players and community. The most recent story for the new region Inazuma seemed rushed and boring. They made it out to be much more than it was going to be. Most recently is the one year anniversary rewards, they are like a slap in the face. Players have spent millions of dollars, and hundreds of hours on this game. They deserve more. The company doesn‚Äôt take criticism and doesn‚Äôt listen to players valid complaints. Overall this game used to be fun but now the company seems to be money hungry and seems to have completely disregarded their players and the community.",1
"By far one of the greediest gotchas I have ever played with its low rates, lack of primos (end game), no daily log in rewards, a stamina system (resin)that is so bad, and content that is not only temporary but also time gated, so even when you do have time to play you cannot complete the event in one sitting ( I can see a couple reasons why they do this, but as a person who doesn‚Äôt have so much free time it is a huge inconvenience)   I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game to almost any just due to the amount of time you would have to invest and how lucky you would need to be, you are better off playing a different game or reading a book or doing literally anything else.

P.S a word of advice for if you do decide to get the game because it looks great or you like the characters and the story please do not spend money on this game you would have to spend 300$+ to get anything guaranteed and if you are playing on mobile not only will this take up over half of your phones space it will also melt your phone.",1
"This game is so fun, there are so many things you can do daily even after you finish the storyline that's out so far. The gacha system seems somewhat fairer than some other games, except for how you buy wishes. On your second buy of the most expensive primogems, you don't get enough gems for 90 wishes, which guarantees you a 5* character. Also, you can't earn enough primogems in ONE DAY for one wish. you usually earn like, 60 primogems just from daily quests when you need 100 more for one wish. If the price was lowered, a LITTLE bit more, like instead of 160 it was like, 100, that would be better. but yeah, the way is to get you to buy things. so if you're as peeved about this as me, toss in your hat and buy the moon blessing and get 90 primos extra a day.",5
"first of all, the game graphics are great. i've been playing on mobile (iOS) and the only problems i've had with graphics have been when the internet was unstable. the scenery and landforms presented in the game are beautiful as well. the art style has grown on me and i can almost recognize it anywhere. the representation of diversity and cultures are nice as well, but skin colors are not represented enough. hoyoverse is a chinese-based game so i understand that the area most of the developers are from doesn't have many poc. but, i believe that isn't a good excuse. poc should be represented in nearly everything, including chinese-based games like this. as an example, what candace was based off of is MUCH darker than how she is represented in the game, and it's pathetic that the developers can't go any darker than a small tan.",4
I am I‚Äôm love with this game as someone who always is looking for a new game that‚Äôs exciting has great animation and that has a compelling story that makes me want to follow it and played more to find outWhat was gonna happen this is the game this is a game of been waiting for for years like I have no words for how beautifully it‚Äôs animated the voice actors that are in it like some other voice actors also voiced in some of the best animes out there and that‚Äôs not even it just everything flow so smoothly my only complaint would be is that lag sometimes is if you‚Äôre in like a bottle with more than like three or four like Hillitrils or creatures like that but other than that it‚Äôs really beautiful there‚Äôs a lot of really cute character is a lot of really relatable story lines the jokes are pretty funny and all the characters look amazing,5
"This game is so much better than I ever thought a mobile game could be. My fianc√© and I are obsessed. I‚Äôve played 60 dollar games that weren‚Äôt so well made. Absolutely amazing.

Edit.

Once you get to about adventure rank 30 (took my fianc√© about a week and I‚Äôm almost there) the game time gates you hard with the energy system in the game known as resin. You will get to a point where you login and use your resin and do your dailies and you won‚Äôt be able to grind end game content until your energy refills (and it‚Äôs very slow). I still think this is an incredible game that I would recommend checking out but unless changes are made to that system I think a lot of people will lose interest because they literally keep you from playing the game.",5
"In my opinion, Genshin is a very visually pleasing game. There are many cool-looking places to take a screenshot, or to just sit and look at. The devs did a very good job on the music and visuals. But, the places to explore are pretty boring. There are basically only 3 things to explore throughout the entire world, a flat grassland, a forest, and a mountain. The game feels very repetitive and copy-pasted. The puzzles are pretty bad too. The puzzles don‚Äôt feel like puzzles, they feel like annoying chores you have to do to progress in the game.

The enemies are also repetitive. It‚Äôs fun to fight a boss the first time, but it gets very annoying to fight the same boss throughout the entire game, but with a longer kill time. You could fight any boss in the game at level 1. Doing less damage or having worse gear doesn‚Äôt make the bosses harder, it just makes them take longer to defeat.
The crappy combat doesn‚Äôt help the game either.
The combat is very spammy. All you have to do is attack and dodge, and it gets very boring. 

This game is a very obvious copy of Breath of the Wild, but worse in terms of gameplay. In BOTW you had many ways to kill enemies, but in Genshin, there‚Äôs occasionally a barrel to avoid spamming through a whole fight, but that‚Äôs it.

Gameplay deserves 2 stars, but the visuals bring it up to a 3.",3
"This game I downloaded since 2020 has been the light of my day every time. I love the riddles and the exploration and how many plot lines there are and how they make so much sense. Exploration has been my things since I don‚Äôt know how long and being able to play this game is everything I need. The music, the scenery is all so beautiful. The creativity they must‚Äôve had to make a game this well developed and entertaining but able to make you figure out stuff on your own and understand difficult situations is even better. This game has its own style and it‚Äôs beautiful. No matter what people say this game will always be beautiful and fun. With the exploration or the small little funny things they put in there as Paimon is not emergency food or the 4 katherines.",5
"I love this game. It always puts a smile on my face just doing daily commissions because the game is so fun to play. I truly love how beautiful the game is, I sometimes get lost in the beauty of the world around me. My favorite spot for sightseeing has got to by Liyue harbor, I sometimes like to switch to characters from Liyue and do a photo shoot there because it is so breathtaking. The quests are almost endless and even though I am AR 55 I still have not finished every major quest in the game. I also love how you can get so invested in characters, just learning about them and discovering which ones you like best. It is breathtaking and I appreciate it so much. If you are still considering downloading the game after reading this review, what are you waiting for? Go for it! You will not regret it.",5
"This game had so much potential to be amazing when it first came out. But all of that potential was squandered and isn‚Äôt being used anymore by hoyoverse. If they care about anxiety then they should remove 50/50 from the limited banners because it gives players anxiety or they should have system to where they add a way to get the character(s) you want without going through 50/50 like how they have the chart course thing for the weapons, they should do that with the characters as well. Plus from what I heard Sumeru is filled with stereotypes, I‚Äôm not middle eastern or SWANA but I feel bad for players that are. I am annoyed with the lack of black/dark skin characters since I am Blasian and it infuriates me that there are only 4 characters that barley even look like my skin tone, with closest one being Xinyan who is called ‚Äúscary‚Äù for her rock star theme attire by the people of Liyue harbor. Please add more diversity and please fix the banners Hoyoverse.
#BoycottGenshinImpact",2
"It‚Äôs seriously not worth the play time anymore‚Ä¶ Genshin is a great game if you‚Äôre into exploring and leveling up like some Isekai anime. The best part however is it‚Äôs combat system which requires the player to clear certain domains and bosses to
acquire the appropriate artifacts and then level those artifacts to improve the general strength of the chosen character. This system would be ideal if the game had endgame combat content so veteran players and even newer players could test out good teams and improve on the artifact quality of characters. The only thing we get is an abyss with just 12 Floors, which once cleared, your done with basically anything concerning combat in the game. Developer have shown no interest in this and have even come out to say they won‚Äôt adding any endgame content which just makes the game boring. It‚Äôs frankly a huge slap in the face which can be changed if developers cared about the player base and not just money it brings. I would‚Äôve given zero stars if I could. BUT ITS NOT WORTH IT",1
"The game is awesome! I started yesterday and I have fallen in love with it. The art is amazing, the voice acting is great, and the fighting style is fun. But a few things that get in the way of the game are the glitches. Sometimes when I‚Äôm playing the game, it just stops and freezes, and sometimes it just randomly makes you leave the game and return to your devices Home Screen. AND (yes there is more) when a cut scene is playing, it always freezes. You only see like one second of the scene, maybe three seconds tops, and those cut scenes are important to the game! I miss a lot of things, and then the NPC‚Äôs talk about it, and your like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see anything dude‚Äù. So keep that in mind when you are playing the game. If the creators are reading this, I really want you to fix this. I‚Äôm giving it four stars because of the glitches. This game would be awesome If you would fix it. Thank you.",4
"i don‚Äôt know how anyone can give this game less than 5 stars. i‚Äôve been craving a good mobile game that is console-like & genshin impact delivers. open world, main quests, side quests, combat, puzzles, backstory, graphics/scenery, for goodness sake even the soundtrack is amazing. the best part? unlike most console games, the developers keep adding more gameplay. i‚Äôm talking whole chunks of land with new characters, enemies, mechanisms & of course quests! oh & it's free! absolutely no ads & no need to spend $1. i honestly want to give the devs money just bc lol. TYSM for this gem üôè

if i was forced to criticize, i wish all doors could be opened. atm, it‚Äôs rare to be able to go inside a building. it doesn‚Äôt need to be over the top with chests & NPCs. it just make the gamers feel more immersed & adds more to exploration.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since the release of the game back in 2020 and was always defending the company whenever people had issues with Hoyoverse, but after the 1st anniversary it was obvious they didn‚Äôt really care for their international fanbase outside of China. Although the game itself is high quality and fun, to me it‚Äôs distasteful when sumeru is coming up and is clearly influenced by South Asia or Middle Eastern regions but the characters are as pale as paper, while this itself isn‚Äôt a huge issue if you look at it alone since some people from those regions do have pale skin; the issue is that when you look at almost all the characters there are only 2 out of 50+ characters are tanned or dark skinned while the majority is fairly pale. Many POC‚Äôs are just asking for some representation and accuracy especially when majority of the characters have at least some cultural significance in their outfit designs. I hope they will listen to the fanbase soon and fix this issue.",1
"Genshin Impact is the first and only game I‚Äôve ever gotten truly addicted to. I‚Äôve spent hours upon hours playing and have even spent a fair share of money in game and I hate to leave a one star for a game I‚Äôve enjoyed so much.. However as Genshin Impact releases more and more nations the racial issues become more relevant. I‚Äôm not leaving a one star simply because the game doesn‚Äôt include enough darker skinned characters, but because they use real life culture for inspiration for their nations.. They cherry pick real life culture and represent it in a poor manner.  It is no secret that the beauty standard in China is pale, and the fact that hoyoverse is a Chinese company. At the end of the day they only care about their Chinese fan base and refuse to listen to any of their other players. Are they that allergic to darker skin? Who knows, but it‚Äôs disappointing. Me and many others will no longer be supporting this game and if you‚Äôre reading this I suggest you consider it as well.  

Some other major points
- all their nations have a specific country that they‚Äôre inspired from aside from the ones where you‚Äôd find darker skin people. 
- their only darker character is barely shown in any events or lore, not to mention a stereotype. Loud, seen as an outcast by others. 
- in their other game honkai, one of their character says she dislikes her dark skin which isn‚Äôt even on the dark side. 

Do you want to continue supporting this game or stand up against it?",1
"This game is very fun. I cant lie, it very detailed, the quests are fun, co-op with your friends is also fun. But there a lots of things that MUST be worked on. Number one, the amount of storage this game takes up. Now this may nit be a problem for people who have lots of storage. But when I play on a iPad that only has 32GB it‚Äôs completely unplayable it‚Äôs so hard to play without worrying about your storage, I have deleted the game many time and have re downloaded it many times as well, just to play. Not to mention the pity system it not the best. F2P people have a hard time reaching pity and now even knowing if they will win the 50/50. Also when playing on mobile devices, when trying to log on the geo element takes a long time to load. And did I forget to mention? You are always being kicked out of the game. It is very annoying and not fun to deal with. MIHOYO PLEASE FIX THIS!!",3
"I have been playing Genshin Impact since it was released and am currently halfway through AR56! I have rarely had problems with lag except when my internet was being bad or something like that (although I do have the Iphone 12 Pro Max so that might be a bit more why). However, I also used to play on my Iphone 8+ and it still worked just as good! 

While there are definitely some annoying things about Genshin Impact (hard to farm for primos at later levels, not-so-great English translations, bad weapon banner drop rates, etc), it is still a very fun game!

I recommend that if you‚Äôve just started playing, to really take your time with it! Enjoy farming and doing quests, don‚Äôt rush too much or you might regret it! It‚Äôs truly a great game that I absolutely adore :)",5
"It's a wonderful game but making it a wonderful game, many people play it. I have many friends that have Genshin Impact and I want to play with them all but sadly can't due to the 4 slots max üòîüòîüòî I understand that it's 4 slots because that's how many people are in a team, but during trial tryouts in quests, it's 5 slots. Maybe don't make it TOO much like 10 but maybe 5-7 or something. I just want to play with all my friends, nothing more. Another suggestion could be that when wishing, like the history, you can see EXACTLY what ar you got that character on to see how you kinda moved along the way. It's just a suggestion and I'd like to keep track of it. I have my current ones so far but I'd like to have an in-game tracker. Overall, Genshin's a really good game!",5
"Been hearing a lot of good news from this game so I decided to try it since I‚Äôve been a fan of Honkai Impact 3rd for years I downloaded the game on a iPhone 7 I downloaded the game and well and I clicked the game and all I saw was a white screen. It asked to send me notifications so I hit allow
And the screen cut in half One part of it being white and another being black.  then after a couple seconds it kicks me out the game acts like I haven‚Äôt even opened it yet . I don‚Äôt know what to say I thought I was going to get a good game but instead I got a white screen and I had to delete a lot of things to download this game do I have any regrets yes. Will I ever download this game again probably not . I can‚Äôt even give a good rating because I have no idea what the gameplay is like .  Do I hate the game no I just wish I could play it",4
"I‚Äôm playing on PC, which is identical to the mobile game, and so far it‚Äôs pretty great. The story is engaging and there‚Äôs tons to do outside the story. I‚Äôm still very new to the game at adventure rank 12, but I‚Äôve put in probably about 10 hours. My progress is very slow, because there‚Äôs just so much to explore that I keep getting sidetracked wandering around the map finding new things midway through the story missions.

As far as p2w elements, I‚Äôm sure this game has them, but at my level of progression, it‚Äôs hardly even noticeable. To get new characters, it seems you have no choice but to pay for premium currency or whatever, but even with only the characters you get for free, it still feels like I‚Äôm playing premium game.

Also, my phone won‚Äôt run this game, but it‚Äôll run on pretty much any PC with integrated graphics.",5
"I downloaded genshin to just see what it was about and now I just can‚Äôt put it down. I often find that it‚Äôs 2 am and I just can‚Äôt stop playing. I love the amount of info on everything it makes it so you don‚Äôt have to look at a wiki page half of the time, also the leveling up seems really polished it is made so you don‚Äôt have to pay for a single level up. I also enjoy the art style it reminds of breath of the wild which I think it‚Äôs inspired from. One last thing I really enjoy that I wish more games had is the element system I love making combinations just to stack an some extra damage, the characters style and personality‚Äôs also seem to go with the element that they have. All in all I just love this game and can‚Äôt get enough of this I don‚Äôt see me putting this game down any time soon.",5
"Okay, I love this game, I freaking love this game. The graphics are great, the lore is great, the characters are great, but right now everyone in the community is a little aggravated. A lot of us were expecting more for Genshin‚Äôs one year anniversary, and I gotta say I‚Äôm really disappointed. I myself have stuck around for in the game for more than a hundred days and artifact farming is the worst! Typically, after so much grinding I would loose interest in the game, but Genshin has something special that has made me stick around. Okay, how do I say this, the anniversary rewards just feel so basic. I mean, it‚Äôs been a year and fans have put in so much money, so I feel like they could be so much more acknowledgment for those diehard fans. I‚Äôm not saying this is bad game, far from it actually, I‚Äôm just feeling a little frustrated at the rewards.",4
"I can‚Äôt stress how good this game is. The mechanics are amazing and I have yet to find a noticeable flaw in any part of it. This games open world concept and diversity of characters and powers reminds me a lot of Skyrim or Fable. The voice acting is enjoyable and I like the plot that has been given. Of course something I notice over and over again that I absolutely love is how the characters don‚Äôt necessarily run out of materials. Like how Amber doesn‚Äôt need to stack up on arrows because she materializes them with no usage of stamina. This game is easy going and very beautiful and detailed. I also haven‚Äôt come across a point where I get tired of playing, everything about this game is addicting and entrances me every second. By far has become my favorite game I have ever played on a mobile device even if it‚Äôs a large app.",5
"You‚Äôll start this game out thinking it‚Äôs just a good looking game that borrowed breath of the wild‚Äôs mechanics, but once you get into it, you‚Äôll realize how stupefyingly amazing this game is. This masterpiece has tons of great voice acting, an in depth intriguing story, and a well made combat system. This game is jam packed with spectacular locations, beautiful architecture, and interesting quests. The map may very well be as big as breath of the wild. Character movement is fluid and combat feels perfect. So many different towns that put breath of the wild‚Äôs four tiny villages to shame. With different architecture types and so many interesting places to visit. This game kills my battery but it‚Äôs worth it. Even just the landscapes are spectacular. I really can‚Äôt heap enough praise onto this game. Definitely the best mobile game I‚Äôve ever seen.",5
"Ok so I‚Äôd normally play mobile games but as I was searching for game to play with a friend came across this one. Ended up playing for 4 hours when I was on way to snooze town. Now it‚Äôs a game I‚Äôm gonna be playing in between mmorpgs I play on my pc. 

So what makes this game really great is anyone who into Zelda will instantly get nostalgic feelings as it will remind any Zelda fans about Zelda. Due to Graphics and the overall plot even though it‚Äôs kinda mundane as in the plot it‚Äôs going with is like any other game like it. But normally it‚Äôs hard to screw up this type of plot so it always good. 

So the combat is really interesting you first select between 2 siblings to play as. Then once your through the first couple introduction quests you get your first combat companion, what is a fire elemental archer. But unlike traditional games were they out in the open world there not around. Because you got to switch to said character to use them in combat. Personally think it‚Äôs unique but honestly don‚Äôt like it but it is unique so whatever. 

Personally hope it comes to either steam or epic game store because being able to play on pc or even on my Xbox. Would make playing the game 10x easier as I‚Äôm not accustomed to mobile games but do enjoy checking them out.",5
"I cannot get over the fact that everything from the characters to the maps are so well designed!!!! Great job MiHoYo!!! I love everything especially the lore omgggggg! This is definitely a great game that you can just hop onto when your bored and stuff, because you can never get bored here! I know I‚Äôm not at Inazuma yet, but I can assure you (new players) everything is still great and fun. You can enjoy almost anything here! What I find that developers did a great job on were the background music, like, oh my gosh boy can I ever get tired of the Port Ormos theme songs, from daytime to nighttime, it‚Äôs great. I really wish I could write more but I feel like it might be too much üòÇüòÇ but I just want everyone to know that this game is just- just a fine piece of a Bob Ross artwork üëåüèªü§åüèª",5
"I‚Äôve been playing since xiao‚Äôs first banner released in 2021 and I‚Äôve sunk quite a bit of money into this game, so it was a big deal for me to delete it. The main reason for this was size. The game was taking up 23 GB in my phone- over a third of my total storage space and 10x the space anything else I had downloaded. That alone wasn‚Äôt a problem bc it ran fine before the update, but when the 2.7 update came out it wouldn‚Äôt update no matter how much stuff I deleted, making the app unusable for me. Another main issue was the lack of late game content. Even before this problem with the update I had not been logging in consistently bc there simply wasn‚Äôt anything to do but farm. I‚Äôll likely get the pc version once I have my pc up and running, but it‚Äôs still very frustrating since I preferred the mobile gameplay",3
"I recommend this game whenever I talk to people and am totally obsessed with Razor. The scenery, plot line, character design, and more are so breath taking you‚Äôre sure to be frozen in admiration. I love the serenitea pot and how it serves as a perfect getaway to interact with your favorite characters and creatures. However, the primogems are overpriced and barely get you anywhere in the game despite being needed to advance. I finished the existing archon quests within half a month and am looking for things to do. I can‚Äôt earn primo gems even though a ton of them are needed to do even the tiniest thing. I don‚Äôt have the kind of money YouTubers have ( I can‚Äôt afford to spend thousands of dollars on a game just to risk not even getting the character -which is supposedly common- I want).",5
"First let me say this game is an amazing game. The story is a great story and is worth every bit of time sunk into the game. 

Second of all, to everyone that is going to give a 1 star rating for 1 year anniversary rewards. Take a chill pill. Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt owe anyone anything. Honestly, they are giving way more than other gatcha games out there on their 1 YEAR anniversary. 10 wishes is more than plenty to everyone. Stop bash rating a game just because you are unhappy about something that a developer decides to give away for free when they could literally make you pay $30+ for the exact same thing! Not only that, but Mihoyo could have simply given us nothing! Take a chill pill and stop bash rating a game for something they are giving you for free.",5
"My iPad is only a year old and struggles to play cinematics at all. Many issues on the speed and performance. I did download it on my ps4 and so far I love it. I am still new to the game but so far it feels like it has the potential to be a masterpiece. It reminds me of several games, including breath of the wild, but it also has its own unique vibe that is pretty fun. Paimon can be annoying at times, mainly for the constant reference to herself in the third person. Again though this game has pulled me away from some big triple a titles, as well as others like warframe. My only fear is that it may get a bit repetitive, like warframe did. However I love the freeroam, it helps with that issue. Over all, a great game highly recomend, ifyou have a console, or the newest and best tablets/phones to play on.",5
"Genshin Impact is a super fun and adventurous game to play. You can explore, wish for characters, do commissions, play co-op, defeat enemies, do quests, and more! I absolutely love this game, the only downfall for me would be artifact farming. Artifacts help make your characters stronger, and can give them more hp, crit damage/crit rate, def, em, and atk. Crit damage/rate are the most useful. they make your characters much stronger, and you can achieve goals the way. though artifact farming isn‚Äôt the easiest, you can also do it in co-op with other people, and it definitely makes it so much easier. Lots of people say Genshin Impact is P2W, though it‚Äôs not. You can be completely F2P and still do great damage. In fact, one of the most powerful teams are with beginner friendly characters. That‚Äôs all for me, enjoy your travels!",5
"Genshin Impact is overall amazing. I love the quality, character design, story plot, the gacha system, everything about the game is great, and I would love to see Teyvat progress, but, the only problem I have is the storage. My storage was going crazy with notifications because it was ‚Äúfull‚Äù. Once I deleted Genshin, it was fine. But thats not my problem. Once I tried reinstalling the game, I had saved around 20GB of storage. On the app store it says you need around 3.7GB of storage, but the game just won‚Äôt install completely. I keep getting an error message saying ‚ÄúInsufficient storage space. Please ensure sufficient space and try again.‚Äù No matter how many apps I delete, photos I delete, it keeps popping up. I really don't know what to do, i‚Äôve tried anything I can do and I really don‚Äôt want to buy more storage.",4
"I really love this game and it‚Äôs really awesome! I love the characters and everything in the game, But I have 2 problems. 1. If I try to look at notices or try to login into a new acc I made, it  says fail and now I can‚Äôt get back into my main account and I don‚Äôt know what to do, my phone is perfectly capable to play this game and I don‚Äôt know why it does this. 2. The second thing is the ascension for the next Adventure Rank, Although it‚Äôs suppose to be hard, it‚Äôs physically impossible to beat. I am stuck on AR 25 because of this and I am WAY over the amount of EXP I need to get to the next AR, I really hope that you guys can just let it be there for players to do and get a really good prize because I really want to get to the next AR but I can‚Äôt. Thanks for reading this if you do, and I really recommend this game!",4
"Overall, this is a fun and addicting game, I‚Äôm stuck at these domains, if you even call it that. I‚Äôm in AR 25 but it went up higher than usual which didn‚Äôt take me to AR 26 and I was confused. Of course it said about that first domain about moving onto AR 26 but I can‚Äôt seem to beat the boss which I‚Äôm close to though, working on it. But the other challenge that seriously is the worst challenge to ever exist. I was confused on why my Co-Op was unavailable and it said something about the Tiangiu Valley, I did the 2 challenges but that last one is so difficult to defeat! At one point I needed one more enemy but the time was at 3 seconds. Either I wish this could give us more time like 2 minutes maybe.. or just never to be heard of again <\33",5
"I‚Äôve played genshin for a while and have seen how events and updates are managed and while things will naturally get stale at a later point in the game, there is a lot that can‚Äôt be solved through events. To my knowledge there are around 50 unique playable characters in genshin however only two of the cast have a different skin tone from the majority. This issue is also incredibly apparent within npc design as well, where no one has a complexion that varies from pale. For a game with such a massive audience and focus on culture, lack of representation and diversity seriously drains the life from the game. Obviously none of the countries are replicas of real ones however seeing places like Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma take inspiration from actual places on earth makes it even more disappointing for events to have no diversity in skin tone when they have npcs from Sumeru. This can easily be added",3
"1. The ability to block incoming attacks there is a meter/gauge for how many attacks you can block before the enemy breaks the guard and if you block at the right time you can parry the attack and deal the same amount of damage that your enemy was about to deal. 

2. The ability to dodge incoming attacks instead of having to dash/run to avoid the attack there can be perfect dodging that slows down time (just like it was in Honkai Impact). 

3. The ability to interact with things such as boats so you can conserve stamina and using specific characters ability‚Äôs to move around like how the traveler (you the player) can make a tornado the tornado can be used to fly up in the air or maybe even be thrown around but the you can only do that when you‚Äôre not in a battle.",5
"i feel like corporate side of this game is especially ungrateful to their fan base- taking a look at anniversary rewards makes that evident. but the devs have tried and successfully made one of the best games of the decade- the lore and stories to easy gameplay, easily one of the best free experiences you can have when starting the game. but if you‚Äôre a person who loved completing everything in a game like BOTW or skyrim, paying feels necessary to succeed, and the gacha system can be wholly unforgiving. when the game is this widely loved, the tiny details like the serenitea pot load or the raidens functionality in a team seem like huge issues, but as a whole this game has literally been life changing as it‚Äôs provided some stability in my life as well as a community. amazing job devs, community and corp. teams step it up!",4
"This game is really fun. I love everything down to the characters, the graphics, and I‚Äôve been addicted to it for a few months now. It‚Äôs literally perfect! The only issue I have is sometimes it gets frustrating when a character is involved in another quest so you can‚Äôt do a different quest. So you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs better to get the other quest out of the way first, right? But sometimes the quest can be difficult and is a quest that needs more than one person. That gets a little frustrating because you can‚Äôt find people to help with it and then you can‚Äôt really do the desired quest until that quest gets solved. And especially if it‚Äôs a limited quest like an event quest, that gets pretty annoying. But overall the game is really fun and it‚Äôs really great.",5
"I don't normally write reviews but for Genshin, I will, because it has done so much for me and they deserve it! Genshin is one of the best games I have ever played. I've been on a hiatus for a long time from games and when I went back to gaming, Genshin was the first one I picked up. Because of this game, I've handled my anxiety better. Along the way, I've met some new friends from different parts of the world as well. I love that it is a live game and I played it everyday since launch! The game developers work so hard in making the game really good. They release new updates every 6 weeks, and new characters almost every month! I am very much grateful to be able to play this game. It has done so much for my life. THANK YOU MIHOYO!

PS - Ignore the 1-star reviews cause those are just salty ungrateful fans.",5
"Genshin Impact is probably one of, if not the most stunning mobile game. I can‚Äôt think of a game that is bigger‚Äîgameplay wise and storage size‚Äîand it‚Äôs quite incredible. However, on mobile, the problem is simply hardware.

Gameplay:
The story and gameplay are fun, with easy controls and mechanics that are fun to master. The story is pretty long with maybe ~10-20 hours as of now, and more story is always being released. The characters are unique and fun to use. The gacha system is a little painful as a F2P player, as it takes a significant amount of time to get the currency needed to start wishing, but since it‚Äôs a free game, it‚Äôs more or less understandable.

Visuals:
Even with all the graphic settings turned down, the game still looks very good. It has a distinct art style that flows quite well. It‚Äôs always fun playing with the hot guys and the cute waifusüò≥

Performance:
This is where the main problem is. Even with a gen 7 iPad, overheating‚Äîeven with every graphical setting turned to the lowest setting and the brightness down all the way‚Äîwas still very common. The large amount of storage the game took also was somewhat of an issue. Being around 14 GB large, it took a very large chunk, no matter what amount of storage you had.",4
"So I liked the game and it has a huge open world to explore. The story and character development is also nice. Your character is not stuck in a lobby with 2d graphics which is nice. My next comment is personal. The problem is the worship of statues in order to gain stamina. I know that it is not real and I am not really worshiping a statue. However, games developers should consider the Jewish and Muslim community that likes to play games but would be turned off by idol worship. They could use terms like ‚Äúclean statue‚Äù or ‚Äúupgrade rock‚Äù in order to allow others to play the game so not to offend possible players. If you guys could change ‚Äúworship statue‚Äù to ‚Äúclean statue‚Äù or ‚Äúupgrade rock‚Äù it would be greatly appreciated. But I know you won‚Äôt do it. But I had to try because I want to share a mutual opinion people have about it. Have a nice day.",4
"okay so let me start off, amazing game. great graphics, great lore, great everything. maybe mihoyo should get some better voice actors though, but that‚Äôs off topic ;). there is no amount of words to describe how great this game is! this game is hella addictive, and can cause, like the title suggests, a gambling addiction. i am ar 50, almost 51, so i‚Äôve been playing the game for quite i while. all through my playing time, it has been so fun. in co-op, you can meet new, amazing people. the events are fun at most times, but even if they aren‚Äôt really the funnest, they can count as a way to pass time. i used to have a huge obsession with this game, but now that i am ar 50+, i must admit it seems to have worn off on me. i still love every bit of it though! keep it up, mihoyo :)

P.S. GIVE ME BLOOD STAINED CHIVALRY",5
I love this game already and I've been thinking that it would be awesome if you were to add a multiplayer server with the max of like 50 people per server so there wont be any lag issues. With the design in this game it would be easy to create a custom character for multiplayer specifically. They could also choose a type of abilities/weapons based on the main story characters. With the fighting kn this game it would look awesome to see two people duel. You could have guild and parties like the co-op function. There would be safe zones where people cannot fight each other but they can outside the zones. This could be a whole the best MMORPG but still have an option to just play story mode. There is so much potential in this game if it had a multiplayer because the game is amazing right now. This could be more!,5
"So the game itself is really amazing. So far I love the characters, the storyline, everything. But, lately, I've been having issues when I'm fighting. If I stray too far from the original point of the fight, the monster I am fighting will stop fighting me and walk away, and when i chase after it, all its hp will suddenly regenerate. This is a huge problem when it comes to fighting the lawachurls or the ruin hunters. Second, lately there's been a glitch when i try to play any domains. After a certain point, monsters stop appearing. Even though they won't appear, the timer will not stop and the monster count won't tell me I'm done. So I end up failing the challenges. This happened while I was in the Midsummer Courtyard and while I was in the Spiral Abyss.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while now, and it‚Äôs been amazing. I‚Äôm ar40 (adventure rank 40) and it‚Äôs still fun to play and farm. I‚Äôm also a f2p (free to play) player, I have never spent any irl money on this game. Out of all the game time I‚Äôve run into a few issues but only 1 that hasn‚Äôt been fixed. My Qiqi elemental skill and burst sometimes does not do the effect, such as the Harold of frost not showing up or the preserver of fortune not effecting the enemies. Not the worst problem but it does effect some gameplay of mine since I use Qiqi a decent amount. No other issues since that. These developers do a very good job on the game and deserve all credit they get and much more. I just wanted to let anyone who reads this of this issue. Thank you for reading... :) <3",5
"first of all, the lack of inconsistency with reruns and character release, yoimiya gets a rerun already? what about hutao, it has been a year. also, with getting character materials, and primogems. ONE WEEK, at AR 55 to get roughly enough level up exp mats, for level 80, not to mention farming boss mats, and region special mats??? genshin wants our time and money, ofc i love genshin as i play it daily, and have for a year, but genshin makes it hard to play without money. the story is good, gameplay is good if you have good build, there needs to be more way to teach builds for new people, bc i had to help my friend who‚Äôs new to genshin so she can get optimal dmg. yes this is mainly a rant, sounding unworthy of the 4 star review, but aside from all these flaws, it‚Äôs a decent game, unique a bit from other games too! that‚Äôs what makes it interesting.",4
"I don‚Äôt normally write reviews, but I am because this bothers me so much. This seems like a really good game, but at the beginning it was just me character and limited surroundings that I could see. There are no backgrounds so it makes it hard to see and figure out where you‚Äôre going. There is also often a white light which makes it even more difficult to see. The water doesn‚Äôt load so you can‚Äôt see that either. Recently, however, it got worse, and I can‚Äôt even see my character or the surroundings. It‚Äôs just a pitch black screen with nothing but the controls on the left and right side. I‚Äôm on IOS 6s. This seems like a fantastic game that I would truly love and enjoy playing but I just can‚Äôt have fun with it when I can‚Äôt see anything. Hopefully this will get fixed soon because I‚Äôm seeing that many other people are having this same problem.",3
"I play on pc but hop on my phone from time to time. This game is addicting, the world is beautiful and amazing. The story is intriguing, gameplay is ehhh but still fun (but I predict the gameplay might die down in the future). Although this is a gatcha game the chances you‚Äôll get someone good isn‚Äôt rigged. A lot of my friends including me started with really good starter characters (Xingling, fischil, and Barbara) without having to pay a single dollar and two of them even got venti. Other people might have their horror stories of exaggerating saying they remade 10+ accounts for good characters but I highly doubt it since I got it on my second re roll and my friends never had to. The game is still in the works but gosh is it amazing. Always something to do and isn‚Äôt promoting its stuff to say (HEY BUY THIS BUY THAT) like other obnoxious mobile games. I recommend playing on pc since the graphics and control is more interactive and visually pleasing if you have a pc.",1
"I downloaded this game yesterday and i think I've been experiencing glitches through out the game. First thing i notice was the view in the distance as well as the ski are pitch black despite everything in close proximity being well lit. I don't see the sun but there‚Äôs a distracting lens flare that beams off of my character at certain points in the game which makes combat and traveling difficult. I made it to the storm dragon fight and I don‚Äôt see anything. I must be in the pitch black sky flying around randomly but I‚Äôm not sure because I cant even see the character onscreen. The combat controls are visible as well as the map and objectives which leads to my confusion. It‚Äôs a beautiful game when i can see things to admire. 
I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but the problem didn‚Äôt change and I‚Äôm getting similar results when I switched the server. If this is part of the game then please help, i cant adventure in pitch darkness.",3
"Okay, so first of all this is an awesome game, it‚Äôs fun to play and it has great graphics and sounds and all. But really, why does it take up so much space? I deleted so many things to download this game, but then when I finally install it, it‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄúNot Enough Space! This game needs 10 GB.‚Äù I‚Äôm really disappointed, because I can‚Äôt even play the game now. It needs so much space. I was able to delete the game and re-install it so I could play the demo, but eventually that had to end early in the game so I just deleted the game after that, and, well, it‚Äôs only a memory now. But for those who are able to play, I‚Äôd recommend it to people who like Zelda: Breath of the Wild‚Äî the game is kind of similar but it‚Äôs girls and a little more anime (okay, maybe a lot more)! Thanks for reading, have a great day and I hope you don‚Äôt have to deal with that problem.",3
"Let me start by saying that this is a great game, possibly one of the best ever made.  The visuals are stunning, the combat system is very well executed, and the voice acting has true emotion in it.  This game truly deserves perfect reviews.  All those people who say that this game is pay to win are wrong.  If you know how the game works, you can use the four starting characters for quite a long time.  But there is one thing to consider before you get this game on mobile.  The download file is approximately 4 gigabytes.  If it is available, I would absolutely recommend getting the game on a console.  It lags a bit on any phone, and you may need to delete some things to be able to download the game.  Keep that in mind before getting the game.",5
"this game is honestly really good overall. the graphics, lore, and gameplay are really cool along with the cutscenes. probably my favorite game, but i feel like there is one problem with this game. in the recent updates, there have been so many mobile players (myself included) that have had to delete the game because of how much storage it takes up. when i last played it took up about 16-20 GB alone. i feel like this is a problem for most mobile players especially for ppl who can‚Äôt afford a pc or a laptop of some sort. currently, i play on my Ipad since it has much more storage than my phone but it‚Äôs much easier to play on my phone other than my ipad. other than this storage problem, i would give this game a 10/10 recommend esp if you‚Äôre into the ‚Äòfairytale‚Äô like plot of games kinda. c:",4
"Genshin Impact is a super fun game. It is fairly easily to earn primogems (what is needed in order to wish) to get new weapons and characters. Speaking of characters, each character is different. They have different appearance styles that applies to their region and vision element. They also have diverse personalities, ways of speaking, elements, etc. You can clearly tell that the creators of Genshin Impact put a lot of thought into their game. Each region‚Äôs theme is very different. This includes there agriculture, architecture, geographical location, and so much more. The creators also put a lot of thought into the instrumentals for each region. If you‚Äôre thinking of getting Genshin Impact, you should definitely get it. Thank you to Genshin Impact‚Äôs creators for giving players such an awesome experience! üòä",5
"This game is quite amazing. From its amazing views, to its fluent combat. This game is probably my number one, favorite open world game of all time. Although the game itself is very time consuming, its not at all too much of a grind in my opinion, if at all. The combat is super fluent compared to most games like this that i have played. It feels like there is more freedom when your fighting enemies. I love the views, they are very beautiful. The characters are unique, although im not great with constellations. The map is huge, and is still growing. The story is well made, and there are plenty of side quests to do if your not in the mood to progress the story sometimes. Over time the quests get longer and more time consuming which is a bother sometimes, but its a great game 11/10.",5
"Would have been a 5 star rating but no. RESIN. I HATE RESIN. Everything else in this game is fine. The graphics and really nice storyline so that i can spend absurd amounts of time making theories (always a plus for me, great gameplay idk I just like it? And   Because i already have Kaeya there is no need to go crazy and spend money. I can also with enough luck plan out which 5 stars i want to save up for and usually get them.(depending on banner rotations). The ONE problem i have with this game is the resin. It time gates things which could be a good thing if you play for around 40 min. A day but I GRIND I GRIND EVERYDAY TO GET GOOD ARTIFACTS LEVEL ALL MY CHARACTER AND I CAN‚ÄôT DO THAT WITH THIS GAMES STUPID RESIN SYSTEM. If you don‚Äôt do that I HIGHLY recomend this game and do hope that you play. Just please don‚Äôt spend to much money and remember that a fictional character is not worth $500.",4
"The game is really fun to play. Great Graphics, Great Storylines, Amazing characters you can get but the way the company treats their players is wrong. I‚Äôve been playing this game since End September to early October and when their anniversary came around I expected something nice or big for us players who have earned and made this company get millions of dollars off just one game. Instead all we got is 2 ten pulls. I‚Äôve earned better rewards off the Lantern Festival tbh. Not to mention the other 10 pull was in response and a forgiving way of the company saying ‚ÄúSorry the rewards were trash here‚Äôs another ten pull.‚Äù Like we could atleast get one standard banner 5 star of our choice. Honestly I would recommend the game but I‚Äôm not sure. I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone to feel like they put so much in it and receive so little from it.",4
I absolutely love this game. I like it even more than Skyrim. The characters are all so unique and well written. I‚Äôve been playing it nonstop for the last year. I got my brother and girlfriend to start playing it too. The co-op with my internet is a bit glitchy but still really fun to play with my girlfriend especially since we can‚Äôt see each other IRL. The game is fun even without buying any of the real money things. My girlfriend as spent a good deal of money on it and I‚Äôve spent nothing on it. We‚Äôre about the same level and are having equal amounts of fun. It of course has its flaws like every game does but it‚Äôs constantly changing and improving. I haven‚Äôt gotten bored yet because of all the new characters they are constantly adding.,5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since Eula‚Äôs first banner, and since the beginning the game has been fun. The story is quite fun and intriguing, and I haven‚Äôt been able to put my phone down since I‚Äôve downloaded. The game itself runs smoothly (even on mobile with decently detailed graphics). There are a few things that annoy me, like the lack of end game content, but it takes a while to get to the end, so you‚Äôll be set for a while. There are also events that can keep you entertained, and my favorite has been the Midsummer Island Adventure. On multiple occasions I cried while playing it, the soundtrack alone is enough to make me tear up. There was not a moment I was bored while playing, and the only thing that makes me sad is that it was temporary.",5
"This game is one I hold dear to my heart, amazing story, characters and so much more. Like many others I really enjoy playing this game! However Genshin Impact just isn‚Äôt fit for mobile. This issue I will talk about it seems to be one many players experience and I don‚Äôt see it being talked about enough. It takes far too much space, I constantly find myself struggling to find space on my phone. The lag is also a big issue when playing. This is truly a great game, it‚Äôs a bummer not everyone had the best experience. Having it available on other platforms or narrowing down the size could improve the storage issue!! Im aware this isn‚Äôt an easy issue to fix but it is a problem. Otherwise Genshin Impact has so much potential , I just hope I can see what it has to offer in the future.",4
"This game is incredibly fun. I‚Äôve played for about 3 months, and a decently hardcore player. The story and quests are great, but they don‚Äôt last very long. Once you finish those, you are free to explore this amazing and vast world. I love exploring, opening chests, and fighting enemies. Once you are decently far in the game, it becomes quite a grind to level up and build your characters. The limit on what you‚Äôre able to do per day (known as original resin) is a shame, but I really enjoy building my characters. This is a gacha game, but you can beat all content with relative ease as a free to play player. Wishing/pulling is quite thrilling as well. Overall, this game is incredible. The mobile experience is much worse than on PC or console, but it‚Äôs still very fun on a mobile device.",5
"Hello I heard a lot of compliments on this game, and it really deserves this praise. I always play it. It became like an addiction. I can't describe the world in terms of beauty and bright colors, but I have a simple problem.
I expect it is not my problem, it is the problem of all people whose language is weak in English. I am here to deliver the voice of all Arabs who do not master English. We wish to add even if it is a translation of the story and dialogues, but we understand the axis of the story and the words of the characters. Really, the game will become very popular in the Arab world, where if it becomes It has an Arabic 
I extend my sincere thanks to you and to the developers of the game, and I hope from the bottom of my heart that you add it, even if it is a simple translation. And thanks again",5
"For a ha ha game , it has risen far above the standards. The graphics themselves are beautiful and even more, can run on mobile-for the most part. From colors to lighting, it rains beautifully down on characters and surroundings. To top it off, the background music is phenomenally appealing. Each piece suits the environment it is in, ranging from the calming exploration to intense combat. Mechanics-wise it is definitely something unique, even for an RPG. The 3D movements of characters and the play style of their abilities are unique to each spectrum of obtainable characters. It truly feels like an interactive game. Moreover, the amount of lore set into each character is literally the most in depth story I have ever seen considering that there is a lengthy text for each character. 10/10 would play again.",5
"Genshin in general is an amazing game! From the storyline to the characters I love it all. I do agree that there could be more daily things to do but, not to just get primos. For higher levels it helps to get experience so, just a few more daily commissions for experience would be lovely! I say that if you are only looking for rewards then, don't leave bad reviews for them not giving lots of primos. The reviews had gone from 4.7 to 1.7 to 4.5 in a span of a few hours because people are leaving bad reviews since miHoYo isn't giving away many primos. This is only the 1st year anniversary for this game so remember that. Anywho, if you're someone who is leaving bad reviews for them not handing out primos please think of the reason you loved genshin to begin with. Thank you.",5
"The game overall is really good and runs smoothly on my phone, ive never really had anything to complain about gameplay wise aside from the oceanide boss battle, and the final act in tatara tales. The oceanide boss fight is incredibly linear and annoying as you cant attack the boss itself but only its summons. As for the last act in tatara tales, the fight is too difficult as the cryo fatui agent rarely aggros onto and goes straight for the purification device which has no health, the hydro fatui agent takes absolutely no damage, and in the second half, the two pyro agents kill you nearly instantly, this quest is too hard for those who are free to play. This could easily be fixed if you gave the characters a few buffs or immunities, or you could remove some of the agents or make them weaker",5
"This has to be by far the best mobile game I have ever played. I like it so much that I even downloaded it a second time on PC to play on a bigger screen. It runs flawlessly at max settings on an iPhone 12, can‚Äôt speak for anything slightly older but I‚Äôm sure tuning the settings will help with anyone having performance issues. 

Some things I really like about this game‚Ä¶

- Fun combat
- Beautiful art style
- Gorgeous open world
- Fun characters 
- Engaging story (for a free game)

Here are a few things I think could use some work or that I wish were slightly different‚Ä¶

- Lack of mounts 
- Currencies in the game are a little confusing, not hard to get by any means, it‚Äôs just overly complicated for no good reason
- leveling in this particular instance is not my cup of tea, I‚Äôm new to Gacha style games so I probably just need to get used to it

Overall my complaints are more nit picks and things I can easily look past. Over time I‚Äôll get use to the leveling and currency so it‚Äôs whatever. On top of that mounts are something that can be added later in development plus traveling by foot isn‚Äôt even that bad. 

Overall this is a great FREE game that anyone should at least give a try.",5
"Genshin is a game that requires dedication and time, but rest assured, it is well spent. Genshin is easily one of the most beautiful and detailed games I have seen in my life. Its many creative concepts that are mostly easy to grasp, and every little puzzle from lighting up Elemental Monuments to the most complex of Inazuma‚Äôs new Electro puzzles are fun to do (except some. I would love to personally smash those dumb electro pillar laser mirror thingies.) You can get many traveling companions, like the new and upcoming characters of this update, Ayaka and Yoimiya. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how big this game is. Its vast world now has 4 massive regions to explore, with lots of fun to be had along the way.

So I beg you, please at least TRY this great game.

Oh, and P.S. I haven‚Äôt even talked about how addicting the gacha system is.",5
"I‚Äôve played this game for weeks. I‚Äôm AR27. I don‚Äôt believe this game is P2W but somewhat is. I think people think it‚Äôs P2W because of the 5-Star characters but really you can carry your team with a 4-star with the right build (I have not yet gained a 5-star). I haven‚Äôt spend a penny on this game at all. There is so much you can do in this game. It‚Äôs a very grindy game if you want good items. I play this game on the PC because I cannot run it on my iPhone 7 (they recommended that you play on iPhone 8 or higher). This game recently came out so expect bugs, give them time to make everything right. 
Some things I hope they work on is just better co-op. It‚Äôs very limited and I hope they make it better along the way! Other than that I love the game so far and will continue to play.",5
"I love this game to death and back. The characters, storyline, and gameplay experience makes this game absolutely fantastic. There are some issues with it, though. For cutscenes like after the story stormterror fight, after the story childe boss, and in many other cutscenes, the game tends to glitch out and/or crash. This makes the game experience much less exciting. To be honest, a lot of people complain about the Gacha rates, but frankly, I‚Äôm okay with them. Sure maybe increasing it to a 1% chance instead of only 0.6% would be great, but the pities at your 75th and 90th wish are already great. I‚Äôve been playing since about 1.0, and the amount of space this game takes up on my iPad Jesus Christ I could cry, if there was any way to compact this game into a smaller storage space, that would be great, since a lot of people only get that free 32GB storage space. It would make the game much more accessible to players like me who can‚Äôt afford 64GB or higher. Anyways the game runs pretty smoothly, it‚Äôs very beautiful. Love ur game üëπ",1
"Now the new update of Sumaru (I am sorry if miss spelled that lol) 
Is fun I like the Tigers  a lot I really wish I had a picture mode so can pictures of them. But I was playing one of world quests for Sumaru (and again I‚Äôm so sorry if I miss spelled it) it‚Äôs the one with the missing children, I have gotten to the point where your supposed to play a lyre (I forgot what the songs called maybe The rhythm of the (____) Dream?) but I thinks it supposed to show you how to play it in the top part of the screen, but it doesn‚Äôt do that for me so I just mashed all the buttons hoping it would work, but it doesn‚Äôt so, does any one know what‚Äôs happening and how to fix it, because I tried logging in and out of my game and it still didn‚Äôt fix this so uh, Help?",5
"I‚Äôve loved this game from the start. Beautiful gameplay, great action, cool characters very well made. The wishes are what frustrates me I‚Äôve put about 20-30 hours into the game already and started 2 days ago. I hate lucky games cause i always end up unlucky. Example my friend has 3 ‚Äú5 star‚Äù hero‚Äôs while i can‚Äôt get anything past a 4 start or my friend will get a ‚Äú5 star item‚Äù and he‚Äôs a way lower level then me. You spend 6 hour grinding for primogems to get a .6% chance at getting a 5 star. Every single time i get like 1 ‚Äú4 star‚Äù champ that‚Äôs not even good maybe a ‚Äú4 star‚Äù item and the rest are completely garbage and useless, this game feels pay to win or grind to MAYBE get a chance at a 5 star hero. I feel angry when i see my lower level friends not putting as much time into this game and come out with great items and hero‚Äôs. Please even out the playing field.",3
"This is a game that surprises me at the beginning. However, with the increase of playing time, you will find that the speed of content production cannot keep up with the needs of the players. It is a long-term updated game, and the version is updated almost every month. However, the new content produced in half a year is only enough for players to play for two or three weeks. Although his music and picture style are still very good, because of the lack of game content and special attention to income, the players who have been playing for a long time are doing some repetitive boring things with low return every day. Perhaps the game planners are not mature, and they need to often imitate the content of other excellent games to design themselves. I hope they can make progress and do not focus too much on making money.",3
"This game is actually really fun! I‚Äôve been looking for a game that could replace some of the other mmos I had stopped playing because I got bored and the games became too pay to win or too grindy for my tastes. So far, i really enjoy the game! Each character has a unique way of playing and I‚Äôd say I really don‚Äôt mind the gacha system since it doesn‚Äôt stop you from enjoying the game...as far as I can tell anyway! I wish the game had character customization. At least for the main character. I would have rather played with my own character, rather than the default starting character. I prefer games where I can have customization and play as my own designed character and sadly, this isn‚Äôt that...but it‚Äôs still a ton of fun! I haven‚Äôt gotten that far in the game- but if it starts to lose its charm, I‚Äôll update my review for sure! Recommend this game!",4
"As someone who plays this game daily-ish, I truly hate it. Yeah the graphics and events are nice but this company chooses to be ignorant about diversity in skin color on characters and claim white glowing characters as a representation of people. They take the reviews as a joke and think the players will eventually move on, what angers me the most is that most of the fandom will. They‚Äôll forget about it once the company gives them some primogems or rewards. They‚Äôll spent money on the game non-stop and never argue about diversity in the the game because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just fictional it doesn‚Äôt hurt you‚Äù yet forget about the impact fictional stuff can do to someone. They‚Äôll defend the game like it‚Äôs their goddam life yet ask that same question it‚Äôs ironic honestly, never met such a stupid and annoying fandom. I sincerely apologize for playing this game and I‚Äôm mad that the graphic are as good as they are, I‚Äôll never spend money on this game and I for sure will never promoted or support it no matter how much they pay me.",1
"Genshin is a really fun game but my problem is the little representation/research genshin does and or has. They show that they can show culture correctly in regions, but when it comes to the characters, it‚Äôs not. Inazuma has a sexualised maiden outfit (yae miko) and sumeru, even tho it‚Äôs based on an area with a lot of dark skinned people, has only light or white skinned characters. Cyro is not dark skinned and neither is Candace. And talking about Candace, she based of kandake, who was a DARK skinned woman. Candace isn‚Äôt even close to kandakes color. Candace is just a white washed version of kandake. And dori, who is another white skinned characters, is just a stereotype! The outfit, the whole genie theme she has, and the fact she‚Äôs a thief is an Arab stereotype. Genshin can obviously make a cultural character right (yun jin) but they decided(?) To not do correct research for sumeru?  Genshin is a great game, but apart from this, it‚Äôs also had past actions that were racist (especially white washing) I feel like it could start trying at a more diverse cast, but I doubt it.",1
"While this game may be beautiful and filled with interesting characters with a wide range of personalities, there is one major flaw that will change your perspective on Hoyoverse and Genshin Impact.

 Out of around 50 characters, there are only 2 characters that have a dark shade. And in multiple official artworks, those characters have been white washed. This problem has been around ever since the game was released, except it‚Äôs now becoming more apparent during the arrival of the new region, Sumeru.

Sumeru is a nation that is based off countries home to darker skinned citizens. You would believe that Sumeru would have dark skinned characters, but the reality is that there are only 3 slightly tan characters. It‚Äôs even more problematic when you learn that those characters are based off historical figures with much darker skinned tones. Take Candace, for example. She is based off a Nubian Queen named Kandake. Her skin tone is my color, and I am white. If you search up Kandake, you will see that she has a very dark skin tone. It is incredibly disrespectful to directly reference on historical figures, but not take the most crucial and impactful part.

It is even worse that Hoyoverse does not acknowledge their fans during this very pressing and important issue. It shows how unprofessional and terrible their company is. If you want to make a difference, don‚Äôt download the game before you start to enjoy it too much.",1
"i‚Äôve been playing genshin since november 2020, a month after release. i can tell you every aspect of this game like the back of my hand. i enjoy the main story line, the hidden lore, the characters overall designs, however, what we are lacking is general representation of more body types or even more basic‚Ä¶.SKIN COLORS !!!! as of right now (7/4/22) there are 3 characters that are even remotely tan. that‚Äôs out of like forty or fifty characters btw. i also get the feeling that with every new character they release the characters significantly downgrade in terms of lore and character design. the dendro archon is said to come out soon but her design looks that of a four star.. she is incredibly underwhelming and her color palette is very bland. i do love the game but if this persists i can see a LOT of the fans having issues with it. don‚Äôt even bother wasting your time to get to AR 60 if this is gonna be the kind of characters you get.",2
"me and my friends all played around 2020 and from there it was just super fun. i played for hours everyday, i spent money, and was excited for new content. but overtime, the game got extremely repetitive, and i lost interest in any of the main story and the objectives of the game. this game slowly felt like a chore. i used to only get on to do my commissions, but now i never get on. its extremely upsetting too because i told my friends i would come back when sumeru comes ‚Äî sumeru is a region based off of the south asian areas ‚Äî because i was excited to see the mix of tan characters and diversity. sadly, there wasnt a single ounce of tan characters except one that isn‚Äôt even considered a five star ‚Äî the rarest in game ‚Äî and was only considered a four star ‚Äî the lowest rank an obtainable character could be. it‚Äôs upsetting. as a tan asian, it feels horrible to be putting so much into this game, hoping to see representation of tan characters in the game because of one region that gave you hope, but it just didn‚Äôt. can you believe that out of 48+ characters in genshin impact, only two so far are dark skin? it‚Äôs funny how the game also switched to hoyoverse to go international and bring representation yet they arent doing that for a nation that should be consisting of dark skin characters. this is just upsetting and im already planning on uninstalling after playing for over a year. im ashamed how much i put in this game just for it to be a waste.",1
"I‚Äôve had about 5 accounts all under the same email address all created the same way. And for idk what reason and this has been an issue with many people I know, the account randomly is logged out and says the account with that email doesn‚Äôt exist. I mean I know my email and I‚Äôve been playing on/off due to this for about a year now. I‚Äôve sunk hours of time into the game, money like real world money into it and poof it‚Äôs gone. Last time I tried to address this issue you couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. This shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, this is something you need to fix, it‚Äôs been a reason I refuse to put money into future accounts and rate the games so low. I‚Äôve played the beginning and haven‚Äôt been able to get as far as my first game was. Im very disappointed in the care of the creators, if not being able to do anything for the game, a refund of money spent towards a new account would be the least they could do.",1
"I truly can‚Äôt say that much because I don‚Äôt have the app anymore so I am unsure of what is going on now but when I did have the app i loved it best RPG you can find. If your a girl( boys can play to of course) and looking for a game that isn‚Äôt all about looking cute than get genshin it has that cute aspect to it but is still have the fights and action your looking for! I do wanna say something though I played mobile so I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like on a computer, but the app took a lot of space when I came to downloading stuff my cloud was almost full! But don‚Äôt think that it will be an issue because even if it fills up the cloud it still runs nicely and is never slow. So yeah idk what else to say so here are so tips for you:

1. Learn how to level up quickly
2. Save up! Don‚Äôt make a wish just after getting coins
3. Try and go to as many places as possible
4. If your stuck or unable to do or finish a task or wherever then try a different one don‚Äôt waste you time

5. Don‚Äôt be to upset finding out cut senes are limited, as you move up levels, go more places, and get more characters then their will be more time to talk to people!!!!

Love a past traveler!üçÑ",5
"I love the game! It‚Äôs so fun and I never get bored while playing it. While it does have a lot of benefits, it does also have some drawbacks to it as well. The game for me kind of started making me go all over the place while I was doing a simple quest that would‚Äôve taken only a few minutes to complete, but as I said, it kept making me go everywhere and so it took me longer to complete the quest than I anticipated it would be. But besides that, the game is absolutely amazing and outstanding. The game runs smoothly and it‚Äôs high quality. If you haven‚Äôt ever played the game yet, I would 100% recommend you to. Though, I‚Äôm sure almost everyone has at this point or at least heard of it. There‚Äôs no way they haven‚Äôt at least heard of it.",5
"Honestly this is one of the saddest companies I‚Äôve seen in my entire life. I am truly sorry for everyone who has wasted more than 30 dollars on this depressing company. Their greediness is beyond frustrating and their lack of understanding or trying to understand their player base makes it worse. For their FIRST (1st, number one!!) anniversary gift to the player base, the people who can give them MILLIONS a month for pixels that won‚Äôt matter in real life, they give us 40 primos (not even enough for a single pull) and a WEEK LONG event where you can receive only one 10 pull‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not even close to being greedy it‚Äôs plain robbery. It‚Äôs disgusting for a company to take advantage of their fan base like this and I am outraged with what we‚Äôre receiving. What makes this worse is that they had the audacity to waste 40 MILLION DOLLARS on Twitter hashtags <3 . Unbelievable and gross. Until there is a change in the way management handles things don‚Äôt even bother attempting to get into the game.",1
"So first off wow this game is amazing! I love how you can focus on adventuring and storylines or if that‚Äôs not your thing it can also be a fighting game! The versatility is really nice and I love the complex backstories too!! But I‚Äôve noticed as the game goes on there‚Äôs less and less things to do, this isn‚Äôt that much of a problem for me but what is is how hard it is to get five star characters you want without spending money in late game. Another thing is the resin system, it takes so long to refresh just one resin which leads to not being able to do much once your resin runs out, and it‚Äôs frustrating how little there is to spend each day especially since there‚Äôs multiple domains which contents change each day. Overall i love the game but I think the gameplay of people who have been playing for a while should be taken more into consideration.",3
"I honestly loved this game more than I thought I would. I had only heard mixed reviews about the game some of my friends said it was good some said it was okay and some said it was too glitchy to enjoy. But I couldn‚Äôt get the game until I got my iPhone 11 because storage on an iPhone 6s is terrible. But I personally never got glitches maybe other than it takes a while to load and actually download the whole game. And the one thing I think I love about this game the most is that it reminds me a LOT of Breath Of The Wild which is my favorite video game of all time. It‚Äôs open world, there‚Äôs treasure, you can become Gordon Ramsay by cooking so many meals, and tons of different missions and places to explore. The story line is beautiful and this game is a 10/10 for me",5
"This is one of the best mobile games out there. I realize its on PC and Console as well. However to play it on mobile is phenomenal. The amount of quests and content in this game has me hooked. I‚Äôve only been playing the game for about 4 days and im already AR 20. Stunning graphics, Great story, and fun to play for hours.

The only suggestion i would make is improving the gliding system. It would be nice to be able to fly rather than to just glide downwards. Or at least glide faster. It is the only method of transportation other than on foot when exploring new areas. It would make the game exciting if players are able to enjoy their wings and fly like the first birds. It seems a bit disappointing how gliding works. 

Other than that fantastic game. Keep up the good work!",5
"It has the things you hate, it has the things you love. It‚Äôs F2P and P2W either choice is viable.  They are constantly updating and introducing QoL things. My major gripe is the quest dialog that isn‚Äôt 100% skippable and they are changing that, so I can‚Äôt really gripe too much.  There are currently (1.1) two zones and even though I‚Äôve explored all over and done everything, my achievement book says otherwise. I hope this company continues on the track they are on. The ‚Äúenergy‚Äù isn‚Äôt really energy. It doesn‚Äôt keep you from playing the game, it‚Äôs more like lock outs in wow or timers in other games.  I can still go farm mobs and bosses outside in the world, cook food, gather other mats and search for chests. Being able to go into my friends world and collect loot from their world and vise versa is another great thing.",5
"I first downloaded this game because I beat Breath of the Wild and my good friend recommended it. I was hoping to start it before remote work but I wasn‚Äôt able to....it takes up SO much of your data! I have a lot of pictures and school related things on my phone I can‚Äôt delete, so if it comes down to it the app is the first to go. My game started after about 5 hours, when I opened it....it‚Äôs the anime knock-off of Breath of the Wild. The plot is a little different, but having your main character lose their memory and need to travel across the open-world to fight monsters and visit shrines/statues is LITERALLY the same. Even some of the monsters look similar to Nintendo‚Äôs design. I think the app is great for someone who wants a fun open-world game and unlimited data, but I would consider spending money on a different game that doesn‚Äôt require in-game purchases for a better experience!",3
"The story is surprisingly good and the gameplay is pretty enjoyable. I was expecting to really enjoy this game. 

However, a normal part of playing an RPG is progression- you become stronger and are able to face stronger enemies. But because of the gacha mechanics, that‚Äôs just not there. I can be 10 or so levels higher than the enemies that I‚Äôm fighting but because I haven‚Äôt gotten a 5 star character with a 5 star weapon, combat takes an inordinately long time. You‚Äôll find yourself needing to use 2 or more full weapon combos on low level trash enemies. Never mind the 10 minute fights for larger enemies well below my level. You have enough HP to survive their attacks, so it's not challenging, its just tedious. 

As a sidenote, there are fairly long periods of the game where you have to do dailies to get your account level up to the point where you can continue the story missions. It's not the worst thing in the world but it is kinda grindy.",3
"Okay so the reason I‚Äôm rating 4 stars is because I‚Äôm into the second chapter, the one you need to be Adventure Rank 10 in order to access, and the kick outs have worsened. By this I mean I‚Äôm just getting to the part I have to track down Venti, and whenever I try to progress it kicks me out and starts my progress over in terms of tracking.
This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve been kicked out repeatedly, I know this game is fairly new on mobile however I can‚Äôt even play for 10 minutes without being forced out. Earlier on the most I could play is maybe, 30 minutes? And that‚Äôs with my little tricks I‚Äôd use. I really enjoy the characters and the storyline, however I can‚Äôt progress because it keeps kicking me out. I don‚Äôt want to stop playing this game, I just got one of my favorite characters too.
Thank you, I hope you have an amazing day :)",4
"I previously said, ""I would absolutely love to play this game as it looks very entertaining, however, I am completely unable to open it; it's the only app on my phone that crashes every time I try to open it.""

I realize now that this is the fault of my phone and not the game. I wanted to try the game so I downloaded it onto my phone, thinking that it would be fee to play on my ps4 as many mobile to console games are. When I found that this wasn't the case, I was beyond delighted and have so far throughly enjoyed playing it! The art is gorgeous and the fighting is very unique! It really feels like a free to play done right and I hope it does well to set a better precedent for other games that claim micro transactions or a $60 price tag are absolutely necessary to make a sustainable game!",5
"Great  visuals, great characters, and a well thought out and enjoyable story. The combat system is well done and the cutscenes are spot on. I have been enjoying the game thus far and plan to continue to play for some time. The only issue is in a game like this the drop rates should be better. Getting one and if your are lucky two 4 stars per ten pull is not enough. This will irritate people and they will stop pulling even if they don‚Äôt stop playing. That is my only complaint. I would also like a way to drop a pin and navigate to a specific location of my choice, so I don‚Äôt have to look back at the map so often.

Excellent work devs. Excellent works to the voice actors and everyone who helped bring this gem to life. I wish you success and healthy profits.",5
"No ads, that‚Äôs perfect! I am able to play freely without any ads. I love this game so much and definitely recommend. It‚Äôs literally the only thing that keeps me enjoyed on my iPad. It‚Äôs great for iPad and pc. I have deleted this game thinking that it was too hard for me when I was younger. I remembered this game and realized that it was pretty easy! I just die a lot with my character. It saves your progress automatically, and if you want to log in on a different device you can! If you forget your password you can change it right back! Kind of like roblox, exept for the fact that there isn‚Äôt random people walking up to you asking to be friends and it‚Äôs just one game. I play this with my friends, I‚Äôll invite more to play with me!",5
"I personally love this game, it looks really nice and can be quite fun at times. But I have 2 big issues, one: storage, it takes up so much storage to me at least. I myself am a high school student with no job, both my iPad and phone only have 32gb of storage. My iPad is just fine and has no reason to be replaced. I have genshin and normally 2-5 other apps I can actually delete. Storage is becoming a big issue. I‚Äôd like to update but even with just 2 other apps my iPad still doesn‚Äôt have the storage to do so. Bringing me to my second issue, I‚Äôd like to keep it on my iPad for the reason of it‚Äôs where I started playing so if I delete it, I can‚Äôt buy anything. If Mihoyo could make it so you can make purchases from other devices, like both mobile and pc that‚Äôd be great. But last I tried nope, not possible.",4
"I decided to download this game after I saw others playing it and it was so worth it! The game is free and the in app purchases are optional. It‚Äôs a open world game full of very well designed characters and regions. You can use wishes to try to add new characters to your team with different elements! The elements have different reactions with each other and with the different characters, they can become very powerful. One small thing is that in the tutorial they to not talk about talents, which is something you can upgrade to get your characters more powerful. But otherwise, this is an amazing game that you should totally download! Their are constant updates and new quests coming out, that are fun and entertaining to play through.",5
"I was really looking forward to Sumeru!! But Hoyoverse dropped the ball. Hoping things change quickly. 
Since Hoyoverse has been good in the past about doing their research and respectfully representing the cultures they draw upon, I expected them to do the same for Sumeru. So far this has not been the case. Sumeru‚Äôs character designs play into horrible and overdone stereotypes. Also, it makes absolutely no sense for everyone in Sumeru to be printer paper white ‚Äî the region is based on Southwest Asia and Northern Africa, a pretty diverse area of the world as far as skin tone goes! It is pretty apparent that colorism and orientalism influenced these character designs for the worse. Generally lazy and uninteresting design work.
Also, I know these were all leaked designs, but I‚Äôm still seriously disappointed ‚Äî if things don‚Äôt improve by the time Sumeru is officially released, I will be considering dropping the game. And I definitely won‚Äôt be spending money to get any of the boring and lazily-designed characters.",1
"So I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for a while now, and I have to say that this is such a good game! The graphics, story, characters, and everything else are really good! I really recommend getting it. However, I have just one tiny suggestion. Whenever I go the camera in the Paimon menu, it takes a while for an idle animation to start to get the right shot. Sometimes, when it does play one, it‚Äôs not the one I really want. So all I want to ask is: Can you maybe add a feature where you can choose which idle animation to play for the character? It‚Äôs just because I like taking pictures but it‚Äôs a but too long to wait for one to play out. Sorry if it‚Äôs too much to ask, but it‚Äôs just a suggestion! Again, really recommend playing this game!",5
"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I‚Äôm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don‚Äôt smoke, but I occasionally drink. I‚Äôm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I‚Äôm trying to explain that I‚Äôm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn‚Äôt lose to anyone.",2
I am loving this game this far and truly enjoy it but I saw that in the latest update it was given supposed controller support for devices on iOS/iPadOS 14 or above and that amongst those supposed supported controllers was to be the Backbone One for iPhones and yet it seems I am unable to utilize this controller for my gameplay of this game via my Backbone One Controller iPhone attachment using my iPhone 12 Pro Max on the latest 14.4 software release from Apple. Not sure if you all are having bugs with your release of support for this feature or what but this game would greatly improve from having this feature in a stable format. This game would be the exact kind of game the Backbone One was meant to help exacerbate in enjoyment and mechanical efficiency for comprehensive and wide gameplay such as this title. Great game just needs some fine-tuning and tweaking here and there.,4
"I‚Äôve played this game since it‚Äôs release almost, and I have spent hundreds upon hundreds if not thousands of hours and around $600 on it. While I understand that might not be much by some of the community standards, it is a substantial sum. Core gameplay is fun enough, the characters are phenomenal in design even if sometimes their abilities may be lackluster, but Mihoyo ruined their game for me. I have left feedback in every survey they ask, and very few times have I felt any positive, significant changes from them added to the game. The game becomes stale and content less for what feels like months at a time, and the in game events are a stopgap at best. Some of them can be fun, but often times they are repetitive and boring. Primos are very difficult to come by, so it is kind of disappointing that their anniversary rewards were so few. There didn‚Äôt even feel like much content for the anniversary itself. I won‚Äôt ever put another dollar into this game, if I even bother to play again. :(",1
"Ehh so I wrote a complaint to Mihoyo about security system issue, and they added 2fa ! !(2 step verification). That was the only complaint I had. About the racist and homophobic reviews‚Ä¶ I been playing this game for a long time, probably longer than most of these people here XD and there are absolutely no racist or any homophobic contents in this game. About losing the 50/50 and not characters you want. Bro, we all experience this. It‚Äôs not because Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt like your skin color or your sexuality so they did this to you, everyone suffer the same things. To be honest, I can‚Äôt tell if people saying this game is homophobic or racist is trolling or being serious hahaha. Also yes, if you have a terrible device to play this on, Genshin can be a bit glitchy.",5
"This is a very well thought out and well made game. A lot of love went into every nook and cranny of its gameplay and world. Unfortunately... it‚Äôs a gacha, and not exactly a generous one at that. The early summon gift is kind but a bit frustrating to be rolling weapons that feel more like gear level fodder than meaningful results. I‚Äôm glad to support a game that has more direct ways of doing so- whether that be cosmetic purchases or an outright cost to play- but it feels frustrating knowing that others have very different and possibly better gameplay experiences not based on meaningful RPG choice but because they paid and rolled better.

As a game, it‚Äôs competent and gorgeous to look at. I never thought Breath of the Wild mixed with a more traditional RPG would work, but this is clear proof that it does. If you can look past the gacha elements- then give this game a try.",4
"So every time I try to play Genshin Impact I get kicked out of the game and I don‚Äôt know why. I have checked that my device is compatible with the game so I really don‚Äôt know. I usually get kicked off the game when I play the game for a long time, use the waypoints and statues to teleport across the map, talk to characters that have voice lines like Childe and Zhongli, when I try to open anything like trying to cook or the gachpon, and when the game is lagging so it does lag sometimes so if you could fix those problems it would be great. So besides being kicked out of the game and the lagging Genshin Impact is great with the events, story‚Äôs, diverse characters, and unique surroundings and every thing else in it so great work and I look for forward to the new updates and thank you for making this game :).",5
"I rarely leave reviews on apps, and never play mobile games, they‚Äôre just not my thing. I started playing Genshin Impact reluctantly on PC as I‚Äôm apt to spend lots of money on these types of games (gacha). 

I can gladly say that the mobile version of the game is very easy to use and almost as good as the PC version! This is the only game I enjoy on mobile, and I love that I can pick up where I left off on PC and vice versa.

The games soundtrack, world, and art style are all very well done. It drags you into the world and it feels fresh. Although the developers say that Breath of the Wild wasn‚Äôt an influence in its creation (probably to avoid lawsuit), one can easily see it at play here. And let me just say, that‚Äôs not a bad thing.

As far as micro transactions go, most people say you can get through the whole game without paying a penny. Those that want all 5* characters and weapons will of course spend, but it‚Äôs not necessary by any means. I willfully spent $30 my first day, and got 3 characters I‚Äôm happy with, but by no means was I forced to or needed to do progress. The only complaint I see around is the resin system, which was put in play to keep addiction in Chinese culture down. 

Overall, great game on mobile AND pc, I‚Äôm really enjoying it.",5
"Genshin Impact is a ‚Äògatcha‚Äô game at heart. It entices you with an interesting gameplay loop and quick progression at the beginning of your adventure, but quickly devolves into ‚Äúpay money in order to have fun.‚Äù The content is locked behind a timed ‚Äòresin‚Äô mechanic, (which can be solved by paying. See the racket?) limiting you to only so many actions per day. This leaves you fairly bored and without much to do save for play for around 20 minutes or so to do daily quests each day. Playable characters, usable weapons, and further upgrades for them are also locked behind payment, meaning that should you have any specific play style in mind you will end up having to pay for it. All in all, the prices are cutthroat, the rates are awful, and the developer knows and preys upon these facts. Become invested at your caution. I give it a 3/5 because the game itself is fun, except the makers are using that fact to prey upon your wallet.",3
"After playing for a week I still cannot believe this is a mobile game! This game is so well made, so much fun, and oh so beautiful! I played both on the PS4 and iOS and I still can't get my head around how fast it loads on iOS after teleporting. On my iPad, it only takes a few seconds but it takes close to a minute or more on the PS4. The story so far is engaging like a well-made triple-A title and the voice acting in all language is top-notch. The world only has two regions so far but it is already gigantic, there are so many details and everywhere you look is very picturistic, you can see lots of devotions went into this game. The music is really soothing, sometimes I just let it play in the background. Lastly, Piamon so funny, some dialogue really cracks me up, please keep up the good work.",5
"This is a free open world RPG better in some ways than Breath of the Wild, though worse in others of course due to mobile restrictions, and it‚Äôs free.

Free. Like, really. What? I spent some money in the gacha because of retail therapy(help me) but honestly you don‚Äôt need to spend any money to get all of the characters. It‚Äôs just pay to progress faster, you can progress just fine though through normal gameplay.

Story is decent, better than a lot of mobile games. Paiman is annoying as heck but you get used to her eventually... think of how annoying Navi is in the original OOT. It‚Äôs like that but worse. The English dub is mediocre but like... you can switch from it to Japanese, Chinese, Korean... the only downside, you miss out on some additional lines that aren‚Äôt subbed so... try to deal with English if you can? If not, it‚Äôs not a huge deal.

Combat is pretty tight, but it can be pretty boring on some characters/elements. However, luckily you get to unlock more skills later, so it‚Äôs probably far more interesting later down the line. Some enemies are very difficult, and you should hold off before fighting them, while others are cake.

Overall I‚Äôd give the game a 7/10 if it were a console game... but this? This is a mobile game. 10/10",5
"Hello Genshin Impact creator!

I was wondering around monstat (sorry If I didn‚Äôt spell it correctly) because I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt want to complete two quest, so I was just running around trying to figure out what I can do and see if I can get another quest, and then I run into a 

dog. Hear me out!! Where do we live in monstat? Do we not have a home where we can lie down for the night or customize in our free time? We don‚Äôt have to customize it or anything or even have a house but please let me pet the dog, or the cats and maybe

 let me keep them! I may not have a home to put them anywhere but why do you just not let us pet them and put a barrier. The dog follows you and it‚Äôs so adorable that I decided to stop what I was doing and write a review. It‚Äôs a good game so far, but I just really want

 to keep the dog or the cat! Maybe make a pet store.. or something. 

If we can‚Äôt keep the pets why not let us pet them? The pets are so adorable!

I put spaces to act like it‚Äôs a cliff hanger, so then you go and read the next paragraph so you don‚Äôt leave my review. Sorry! I just wanted to say that to make sure nobody was confused why I kept putting space. I just wanted the Genshin creator to read all of my paragraphs. Sorry!",4
"The anti consumer practices of this game are largely unnoticed because most people who play this game are kids who don‚Äôt know better or casuals who don‚Äôt expect better. For many this is their first real ‚Äúgame‚Äù and they don‚Äôt realize the lack of communication on the company‚Äôs part is unacceptable. Play it if you want, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest spending money on it. The companies decisions are clearly motivated by money to the point the games balance and health take a major back seat. It‚Äôs not that it isn‚Äôt fun, but if you can get to AR 57 or so and not spend money then I advise you to do so. The game won‚Äôt change so what you see is what you get. If you are ok with that then feel free to spend, but just know their entire business model is built on FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and you should attempt not to be pulled in. There are other good games that exist and are on the horizon 2023 onward that are more respectful toward their audience.",2
"Genshin is effectively a live service game that doesn‚Äôt really offer much at all in terms of meaningful content. Once you‚Äôve finished all the quests, the game play loop essentially boils downs down to logging in for 10 minutes a day to complete the same 4 tedious quests over and over again.

The main attraction in the updates to this game are the newly released characters. At a certain point you come to realize that there‚Äôs no real point in pulling for new characters and leveling them up when the developers have said that they don‚Äôt intend to add endgame content. Even casual unit collection games like Pok√©mon at the very least offer battle modes and PvP content to keep you interested after completing the storyline.

Honestly this is really only the tip of the iceberg, the game feels very predatory by virtue of being a gacha. I mean $100 doesn‚Äôt even guarantee you the currently featured character. For all these reasons I cannot recommend the game to anyone.",1
"After playing for a year, I can say that Genshin Impact is truly one of a kind. Whilst there are games that try to mimic it, the original will forever hold its place. The story, the feelings and emotions, it all is what makes Genshin so special and intriguing. When I first started playing, it had me hooked. To when I got my first 5-Star to when I finally reached Sumeru. I started in the summer of 2021 and I am excited to stick around to see the future of this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who finds joy and interest in games that while they have fighting, they have a lore-ridden story. And while some may disagree, this game really can be F2P friendly. It all depends on you. If you do play this game, I wish you the best on your travel, Adventurer.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since September 2020, and while I have to admit there is a lot to enjoy about this game, Hoyoverse‚Äôs dedication to making all their released characters white is not one of them.  Their latest decision to design a country very blatantly inspired by a hodgepodge of Egyptian, Middle Eastern, and South Asian cultures, while intentionally making every one of the characters white is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs going to save me a lot of money, I guess, because I am never spending a cent on this game again.  I‚Äôm not rolling for the new characters either.  After all the loving attention to detail and authenticity Hoyoverse spent on its Japanese and Chinese-inspired countries (while still making all but one of the characters white even though people of darker skin tones live in those countries too), the difference is pretty yikes-worthy.  Not looking forward to when they make their Africa-inspired country full of white people too.  Not a good look, Hoyoverse, not good at all.",1
"Genshin Impact is a very fun game that doesn‚Äôt cost a dime, and it also has plenty of stuff to keep the game fun to a certain extent. You can do quests, build characters, play with other and so much more, but the fun only lasts for a while. I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and am ar 52 there‚Äôs not much to do now other than do domains to get artifacts to make you stronger, wait for resin to replenish, and wish. I‚Äôve done almost all the quests and find it quite boring while waiting for the next big update like Sumero, there‚Äôs still plenty of stuff I can do its just not as fun as getting to explore something new. It‚Äôd be amazing if another quest similar to the golden archipelago came out to keep us occupied and so we can get ready for when Sumero comes. Overall it‚Äôs a an amazing game with lots of stuff to do for lower ar.",4
"So this review is based off of my experiences with the game (I have yet to complete the game). So far this game has been very entertaining with its RPG aspects and Open World. This game can keep you busy for hours on end with a thrilling story, fun quests, puzzles and hard fights. My only problem so far has been with the gacha system and leveling system. So far the gacha system has been extremely disappointing with terrible rates for characters. For example I spent $40 and got duplicates characters, nothing new. The leveling system has also been a pain with it being too hard to get Adventurer XP and Character XP being too low on the World Bosses. Final thing to note, Primogems are way too hard to get. If you want to get a new character like Venti you‚Äôd have to get 1600 Primogems just to have a good chance.",4
"This game as a whole is really good. I‚Äôve played for a long time and enjoyed it. However there‚Äôs 1 aspect of the new area that‚Äôs recently been released that makes this game extremely unenjoyable. It‚Äôs the inazuma puzzles. Once you get to a high enough rank in the game and complete certain missions, you‚Äôre able to freely travel about the new area called inazuma. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail about inazuma itself, but the puzzles that were required to complete are absolutely horrendous. The more complex level puzzles (relay stones; electric seelie puzzles;etc.) are poorly thought out, and almost impossible to complete. If we‚Äôre going to be required to do puzzles in order to obtain objects needed for leveling up in the game ( i.e. electroculous; quest items; chests) then we should either get more assistance with the puzzles or not have them be over the top for absolutely no reason. Other then that I‚Äôm content with the gameplay.",2
"I‚Äôm a dedicated player, who has spent money and plays almost every day. I am AR 55. For almost every game I have ever played that is like genshin impact or even just games in general give good and generous anniversary awards. We as the players have made genshin an extremely popular game, as well as earned the company billions of dollars. For them to treat their player base like this is abysmal. Why would people want to continue supporting a game were it is so clear and obvious the company doesn‚Äôt care about their player base? Especially when without us, they wouldn‚Äôt have the revenue and clout they have now. I think it is so ridiculous and sad. I really love this game it has so many good things, but this treatment has changed my overall opinion and feelings a bit. Mihoyo is driving away their loyal fan base and they don‚Äôt have the decency to acknowledge it or fix it. It makes me very sad. I will continue playing, but unless I see some change in this behavior they will never get another dime from me.",1
"The game is really fun and entertaining to play. It has a good storyline, immersive characters with their own backstory, has good and difficult bosses, and there is so much to say about the game. I‚Äôve been playing for around 5 months and I can say this is one of the best mobile games on the store. Since it is a demanding game, You will need to have a slightly good iPhone or iPad to enjoy the game. I personally play on the XR and 4th generation iPad Air, and they work flawlessly with no lag. There is also a gacha system for obtaining new characters and weapons. The guaranteed number to get a ‚Äú5-star‚Äù character or weapon is a bit high, but each character or weapon you get can be used to its max potential. Overall, this game is worth it, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",5
"I love this game a lot, I‚Äôm impressed too with the animation so much after playing Honkai Impact 3rd and going to see this. The opening cutscene had me in awe from how beautiful the animation was at the beginning! The characters have beautiful designs too, and you guys did such a good job on this open world game! Especially one that can go on mobile! However..

There are a few things I have a problem with. Of course the game is still developing, but sometimes I wonder why when going to other people‚Äôs worlds it‚Äôs so strict on crafting stuff and what not? I understand for the chests but it does seem a bit unfair for crafting. Or how only food can be used on just your characters during co-op mode or how shields can only be activated for you most of the time and how you‚Äôre limited at doing stuff together in co-op mode. I even wish we could do Spiral-Abyss with other players.

Other than that, I hope we have other options too such as petting animals in the game and what not! Maybe even different interactions when our characters are around others. Such as Diluc seeing Donna in a way if that‚Äôs possible.

I love this game though and can‚Äôt wait for more things to come out soon, I hope this review helps! <3",5
"This games great and for people saying it‚Äôs so laggy, well it‚Äôs because of your trash WiFi ok and ascending is not hard just lvl up your adventure lvl and then beat a lot of monsters and complete quests and you will get A lot of xp and primo gems which I will get on to later, and for people saying it‚Äôs a copy of Zelda it‚Äôs not and it just isn‚Äôt, and for people saying it‚Äôs so hard to get characters then just go to the wish section and switch it to a place where you have a good chance of getting good characters and click the 10x thing and it says to pay 1600 primo gems and click yes since you saved up and you get a lot of characters that are 5 or 4 stars which are really good so yes that‚Äôs why you guys are trash at this
 Game",5
"I love the art and music. When I first played it, I was supposed to talk to this fairy thing. But I didn't see it around, so I just picked an interesting direction and walked. I saw a city of windmills in the distance so I decided to go check it out. I explored it, battled some monsters, gathered herbs, killed harmful wild boars and used their meat, learned how to cook(!) and learned to glide from high places to lower ones, gained some levels and eventually got a little bored.

Then I remembered the fairy, so I teleported back to where I started and found her. She then proceeded to teach me how to play the game. Except I'd already learned what she was saying. In fact she told me to kill some monsters and open their treasure chest... and I already had. They weren't there before and the chest lay empty. I chuckled at that.

After that, I played the game as designed, and the quests are fun and beautiful. Except I was a much higher level due to my exploring so the quests were easier than they should be.

The combat takes actual thought. I've defeated foes way too difficult for me by tricking them and using my characters in just the right way. Unlike other iPhone games where you can just turn on auto-combat and your strategy is uneeded.",5
"I started right when 2.8 started. At first, I loved every part of it and ate everything up. Also, Sumeru also made everything fun as well! But, the content stopped abruptly when I was AR 53 l. Now, the only content I had was to finish those few boring world quests, get your reputation up, farm, farm, and the teapot. I think this was partly my fault because I played this game almost everyday. However, Genshin is getting better with the content and balancing it a bit better. So, take it from me. Genshin was made to be a game so that you don‚Äôt need to rush it. Please don‚Äôt rush it. You don‚Äôt need to play everyday. Just be one of those few people who actually touches grass. Despite all of this though, Genshin Impact is a great game to play with friends or just yourself. Have a good day wherever you are.",4
"The game is amazing in how it draws you in with its open world style, quests, gorgeous art, and seemingly endless supply of things to grind. Then you get gated by their resin system. Ascension mats, weapon mats, gold, exp, talent mats all need resin to collect and you will begin to hit a wall around AR25. It just becomes 10 min of dailies and log off. Co op is incredibly buggy and has little value still. The storyline ends at AR29 and you will be almost done with all content by there. The next update is in 5 weeks(verified by mihoyo), but it isn‚Äôt even a big content patch. The first big one is scheduled for 12/23, so be prepared for very little things to do compared to your first week. Lastly, the gacha rate is 0.6% for a 5 star, the lowest rate of any big gacha out there. They also stop giving you free rolls pretty soon so it‚Äôs not f2p friendly at all. 
Unless Mihoyo makes some big changes in the coming updates or adds in some small frequent patches, there is very little content later on and not much to do.",1
"This is a great game, and i have not yet completed the story. The story so far is amazing and the characters are great. I love a lot of the mechanics except for some of the puzzles in inazuma. I have not been playing very long and Im at adventure rank forty two. My only complaints about this game are; 1. The game takes up so much storage on the computer and frequently overheats my computer, and 2. At first primogems to get characters are fairly easy to get, but recently I‚Äôve been having to grind at the spiral abyss and been relying on events to get primogems. I got Ayaka during her banner, which was when i joined, and got Mona out of the standard banner. I have not been able to get another five star since then. Primogems need to be easier to get for free to play players. However, it is still a great game.",4
"I know a lot of people think it‚Äôs bad for many many reasons but I remember last summer when I downloaded it and it felt really magical, the quality is amazing and I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. The characters and bosses look amazing, for example La Signora and Scaramouche boss looked amazing. Even tho it‚Äôs mostly the Gacha system and spending money, it‚Äôs still fun to get new characters. One thing that‚Äôs kinda ehh for me is the fact that 50% of the community are simps and the other 50% are people obsessed with spending their money to swipe. There is that one part of the community tho which are the Twitch streamers. For example, Antony Chenn, Jake Tuonto, Dish, Asian guy streams also known as Atsu, Bwapp, and many more make the community amazing! So overall, I think the game is amazing!!",5
"I have played this game since it came out. Never in my life have I ever been so displeased with a game. The gacha system is unfair, the rewards are unfair, the storylore is boring, gameplay is mid. Nothing about this game makes me happy anymore. The only reason I actually continue playing is because I enjoy the characters. Even then, the ability to actually get the character I want is so low that I don‚Äôt even try anymore. I‚Äôve spent at least 100 dollars on this game and I regret it. Some people have spent over 1000. 

The people who work on this game, do not care about making characters with darker skin tones. The most we have are tans characters. Even then they are barely darker then other characters. The character who was based off a queen, who was dark skin, is tan. Sumeru‚Äôs npcs are 10x darker then the playable characters from the area. I am tired of this game, I am tired of this company, I am tired. 

Do not play this game. It‚Äôs not a good game. It‚Äôs boring and it‚Äôs draining.",1
"Gameplay is not locked behind a paywall. Music and graphics are probably the best thing from this game, the quality is incredible. Gameplay is high quality and smooth. The open world environment is beautiful. 

Game currency for wishing is more on the generous side IF you play everyday and participate in all events. 

Cons are lack of ‚Äúend game‚Äù mechanics. Once you‚Äôve exhausted the world and story you‚Äôre left waiting days/weeks for little events. Major updates come around every patch which is about 6 weeks. That‚Äôs pretty fast for development, but when there‚Äôs nothing to do but log in and play for 15 minutes everyday in between, those patch updates feel like they take forever.",5
"Honestly, this game has every right to be known as the best game starting from its release up until now, but there are a few problems. First off is the playability on mobile. I mostly play Genshin on PC now since it has better RAM and CPU. I am pretty sure that you try your best to compress most of your resources for mobile players, but this game gets more and more unplayable on my phone as time goes by. Second is the server lag. I triple-checked the Server Ping on my PC and on my phone and I noticed that the ping on my phone fluctuates more often at 150 ms and even reaching up to 290 ms, while my PC is doing fine. If you truly wish to promote this game as a mobile game then these are the things you need to do.

I really love this game and I would appeciate it very much to have these fixed.",4
I really recommend this game for people who get bored often. Genshin Impact changes my lack of boredom. Not to mention how great the games is within its designs graphics and story lines! I honestly enjoy this game so much. Everyone has their own opinions but the amount of 1 star reviews is a little unnecessary judging on how good this game really is. Some people complain about it being laggy or the graphics not as good in mobile. As someone that plays in mobile what are you guys talking about ?! The graphics work fine for me and everything is still just as great! I just think it‚Äôs a little unnecessary  for all the 1 star rate reviews. Over all this game is a easy 5 star review for me . Keep up the great work <33 I‚Äôm looking forward to 2.7 üíóStay safe‚Äô ! ü•≥,5
"The game in total is beautiful and has amazing grapics. The pity system might be a little crabby, but that‚Äôs the fun part about the game! Even if you don‚Äôt get the character you want, there are re-runs and in the meantime you can farm artifacts for your favorite characters. Everything about genshin impact is great. But it‚Äôs just the people on the game making it harder sometimes. There are toxic people in the game and they can be really mean. But it‚Äôs online and you can just leave the game. This is why I love genshin impact. One more reason is the story quests and voice lines! The actors put in a lot of effort to have so many voice lines. It‚Äôs so crazy like the event with Clide and Xingyan, they have extra voice lines! That is a lot of work and that is why I love genshin impact!",5
"This game is fun and amazing for a game that‚Äôs free, I see a lot of complaints about how it‚Äôs not f2p, however, I‚Äôm a player that hasn‚Äôt spent anything on the game and I still have plenty of fun getting some of the characters I want. However, as a f2p player I don‚Äôt have the luxury of getting all the characters I want. It takes time to get all the primogems you need to get one wish (especially late game). Not to mention wanting to get a 5 star with no pity when it‚Äôs not even guaranteed you‚Äôll get it. For Hoyoverse, I think a great way to make the game better would be to either lower the price of wishes, or to give out more primos during events like anniversaries or maintenance. Especially since it‚Äôs already a very successful game that‚Äôs made a lot of money.",5
My younger sister told me about this game after we were talking about our favorite type of games. I love questing and story line type of games. I haven‚Äôt gotten addicted to a game since wizard101 years ago. I downloaded this game at about 1 in the morning. I couldn‚Äôt stay off my phone until I made myself go to bed at 4:45 in the morning. The next morning I went right back on and started playing once again. I absolutely fell in love with this game. It is a game that keeps me entertained and it‚Äôs super helpful when it comes to questing. You do feel rage sometimes when playing because of certain bosses but it‚Äôa beyond worth it! Thank you to the creators of this game! It‚Äôs amazing! Keep up the great and hard work!!,5
"I was extremely skeptical about downloading this game, for the reason that I felt it directly copied off of Nintendo‚Äôs hit open world RPG game Breath of the Wild. I am an avid fan of the Zelda franchise, so the idea that there was an ‚Äúanime ripoff‚Äù of the game really rubbed me the wrong way. But I was glad I finally decided to give it a go. The story line is incredibly engaging, the combat/attack animations are smooth and fluid, the graphics are GORGEOUS, and there is so much to see and do to keep you interested. And the best part? YOU ARENT REQUIRED TO DUMP YOUR WALLET INTO THE GAME!!!! Genshin Impact is 100% free to play friendly, and in-game currency is extremely easy to obtain through quests and events. With the new Inazuma update coming out, I‚Äôm more than excited to see what else Mihoyo has in store for us!",5
"I never thought i‚Äôd be able to play a game like this. i was wary of a character collection system and worried it was another overrated team game, but it‚Äôs not at all like that! i‚Äôve never seen anything like this before and i love it. my iphone 7 plus is below the recommended and i do have to take breaks every once in a while due to overheating but it‚Äôs honestly not that bad considering my phone is pretty old. i‚Äôm on the lowest settings and it‚Äôs still absolutely gorgeous. the world is unbelievably beautiful and everything i‚Äôve ever dreamed of in a game. you can play immersively running around everywhere yourself AND you can teleport places for efficiency. i‚Äôm absolutely in love and so grateful to the devs. i 100% want to live in the world and i‚Äôm excited to see what gets added in the future and explore everything!",5
"I LOVE GENSHIN SO MUCH. the characters bring me so much comfort and the overall play style in the game is so amazing to me, I play other games and get disappointed now because I can never find a game as beautiful as genshin impact!! I wake up in the morning excited to adventure with my team, my life is literally genshin now. The reason my Review isn't at 5 stars is because it's a very very hard game to play f2p, even If you decide to pay the prices are high, it's about $1 for 160 crystals, it's very hard to gain characters, let alone build them, their weapons needed are normally pay to play too, in order to get a strong character you need to devote a lot of your time to them, which I do understand some people enjoy, I just wish there were more ways to obtain primogems, that would cost time instead of money.",4
"Hello! Genshin Impact is probably one of the BEST anime games! You‚Äôre own character has a voice! Most anime games don‚Äôt have voices for our character. 

GLITCH/BUG
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Although, there is one problem...there is a glitch/bug that everything is black! This happened when I was playing for the first time, choosing my gender, and then I accidentally picked male! I panicked and deleted the game then, downloaded it again. the next time I played it, I chose the correct gender. The moment when I loaded into the game, everything was black. I thought, maybe because I don‚Äôt have much space? No, that wasn‚Äôt the problem. 

WHERE
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

This glitch/bug was surrounding me. The area where I step at, (EX:  next to beach) wasn‚Äôt black. But, as soon as I walked somewhere else, it was black. 

COMPATIBILITY
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I seen a few gameplays about this app and I was amazed. I can‚Äôt play it because if this glitch/bug. Please make this app more compatible for the devices that aren‚Äôt ready. I don‚Äôt know what iPad I‚Äôm using, but all I seen in the compatibility section was ONLY iPad Pros. 

I hope you can fix this glitch/bug! ‚ù§Ô∏è üíï üíó",5
"The game is good, especially for a free to play game. You can easily get 40-50 hours out of this. 

The biggest issue is that the game is a gacha game, which wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if it was fair but the pull rate for a 5* is 1 per 90 or 0.6% whichever comes first, Which more often than not you will hit the 90 first. Other games in this same category have a 7.0% pull rate. Meaning you are more than 10 times more likely with this games competitors. 

There is no free daily summons, no daily log in rewards, no rewards monthly calendar, and the rewards run dry after the first few hours of leveling. The game makes you trial hero‚Äôs so you will see how much better than yours they are. 

If you do all the content to level 25 in less than a month there is no more game left. You become a trash collector trying to find all the trash chests in the world for just a little bit more exp / money / artifacts / weapons / books so you can progress. But that runs dry around level 30. 
There is nothing to do after the main story quests. And the things that are available are tied to a ticket system called resin which holds you back even more because of the random low drop rate and random rolls on gear. 

The resin system allows you to do 2-6 ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù daily depending on which you do. These have low drop rate on resources or items of a useable tier. So progression is locked behind months to years of daily play.",1
From the start of the game it was amazing the characters and Paimon but I can‚Äôt really write much in this review because of the background it‚Äôs all black and the water is too it‚Äôs hard to enjoy the game and hard to move when you can‚Äôt see like you might fall off a cliff or into the water I tried playing hoping that the background would load in but it didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm supposed to be fighting Stormterror when you get to the first village but since I can‚Äôt see the the sky and the cut scenes I have absolutely no idea on what is supposed to be happening and I can‚Äôt defeat stormterror and I can‚Äôt exit out of it. I really want to play the game and I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled it a few times but nothing seems to work and I‚Äôm kinda sad some of my friends are ahead of me. Please look into this problem I‚Äôm sure many others are having it too.,3
"I absolutely love this game so far. It handles fairly well, and it looks gorgeous. I‚Äôve played your other games, such as honkai impact 3, and it certainly feels like an improvement. I love the open world feel of it, and the ability to interact with the environment and combat. Ofc there‚Äôs some loading issues, and occasional lag spikes, but if you get past that, it‚Äôs wonderful. However, I hear it is out on console, so I tried to use my controller to play it (I use an Xbox controller so maybe that was the issue) but was a little disappointed to find it didn‚Äôt work on mobile. Ever since controllers were able to be used on IOS games, I‚Äôve preferred to use it instead of touch. It‚Äôs a bit more responsive and easy to handle. So please, add controller compatibility to the mobile version!",5
"I have been playing this game for months now and honestly I haven‚Äôt been addicted to a game since things on my PlayStation three. Ever since then, no game has really caught my interest until Genshin Impact! At first, it kind of reminded me of the Zelda games, and I only played for a few hours. But as time went on the more things that could be done, and the storylines are really what got me coming back time and time again. Not just that the updates are great and I also don‚Äôt have to spend money in game to continue through the stories like you would with some other games. So even if you only want to put a few minutes into a game or a few hours, this is definitely the one to have!",5
"Genshin is supper fun to play if you are looking for an adventure and great storyline, storytelling and great characters there are so many different ways to play with characters build them to become stronger level up get money and get more. Almost every month  there is a new evens or update  that is supper interesting Genshin also has got some amazing views go check it out you won‚Äôt regret it (but ur wallet might :,D ) also genshin has an amazingly cool system for their gacha where is you get to 75 or more pity you get a 5 star Character and if you don‚Äôt get the one you want then you have a guaranteed for next time you get to pity not to mention there is a ton of things to do and play even with your friends !! Need I say more I don‚Äôt think so GET IT! :)",5
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin impact for about half a year now. In the beginning, it was fun and relatively easy- it was also easier to get primogems - I think you all know where this is going. As you progress, it becomes harder and harder to get the five star character you want and the game can start to feel like a chore. Unlike some people, I do enjoy grinding, though the resin system stops me from doing it all at once. The visuals are gorgeous, and overall it‚Äôs a really nice experience when you start playing. I see a lot of complaints about the odds of the gacha system, and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a quick cash grab for the company, but honestly you don‚Äôt need a five star to do well in the game until towards the end, which by then you will definitely have enough primogems. Overall, it was great in the beginning, less great towards the end.",3
I love the game. I spend such an unhealthy amount of time on it. And I know it updated only 25 minutes ago. But there‚Äôs already a very frustrating problem in 2.8. I was messaging my friend and closed chat for a second. They messaged me back and it all deleted. I figured it was just a glitch so I kept closing and it wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs happening on their end too and I play mobile so it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating having to ask them to repeat. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs doing this but no one likes it. It‚Äôs so incredibly frustrating. All of my past conversations with my friends have just disappeared. I‚Äôm talking with someone who doesn‚Äôt even speak English so communicating will be so much harder. Please fix this.,5
"In genshin impact there is a character named Xinyan. At first she seems like a perfect example of representation. But when you actually get her in the game she‚Äôs a walking talking stereotype. Her favorite dish is Spicy chicken, she‚Äôs seen as ‚Äúloud‚Äù and ‚Äúannoying‚Äù by people in Liyue. People are often afraid of her because of what she looks like. This isn‚Äôt the first time Hoyoverse has made a stereotypical black character. In their other game called Honkai there is another stereotypical character named Carol. She doesn‚Äôt like going out because she‚Äôs afraid of getting darker(as in skin tone) . Also in the webtoon for this game Carols mother makes an appearance. Carols mother is a dark skinned woman who is very stereotypical and a prime example of the SBW stereotype. As a black person who plays genshin impact, seeing how hoyoverse portrays people that look like me makes me feel uncomfortable. The game could go with out all of these stereotypes. The game could also go without slavery. But that‚Äôs a entirely different subject.",1
"Like the title says, every in-game aspect is absolutely wonderful, down to the smallest details like the grass, fire, and ice.
 Naturally from a free mobile app that offers so much, you‚Äôd expect the most generous of rewards from doing your daily commissions or even important world quests. But no, 10 primogems per commission, and 20 for completing all 4. Even with the $5.00 Welkin‚Äôs Moon, which gives you 90 gems each day for a month, will only tally you up to 150 primogems. Not even enough for one wish. 
Maybe they‚Äôll be more generous on their one year anniversary! Nope. A cute reward, sure, but we want gameplay rewards! Speaking of which, there actually is an‚Ä¶ ok daily reward for the anniversary. One wish for day one and random rewards afterwards, totaling up to ONE TEN PULL. One! And for that ten pull, we have to wait 7 days. 
About wishes and the gacha system‚Äî not even THAT is generous. With soft pity beginning at 65-70 and hard pity at 80-90+, it‚Äôs almost impossible for a free-to-play player to get even ONE five star on an event banner! Not to mention the chances of getting a four star weapon and the rest being three stars. Yeah, not even a guranteed chance if gettting a character on each pull. 

Do better MiHoYo.",4
"This game is beautiful in every way especially the quality but when it comes to gacha its just unfair, every update they gives few primogems that it isnt enough to get the character we want to enjoy. The 50/50 makes it more worse. It will be easy to get primogems at first but as you reach higher ranking you get less and less. The only way to get the charcter you want is either you save and skip or spend money. This game is basically a gambling addiction. Even the domains like the artifact domain luck is bad. People work hard just to get something bad. They have to work and work especially ar 50 since theres basically nothing much you can do there. If i had to choose a gacha game between genshin and cookie run, i would choose cookie run since its more considerate and theres always things you can do. Theres so much drama to the community bc of this, that this game is hardly even fun n enjoyable. So please, mihoyo atleast be more be fair to us especially the fyps.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since it‚Äôs release in September of last year, I‚Äôve dedicated myself to the lore and quests and i‚Äôve had so much playing this game and can tell the artists and developers worked really hard on the story and plots.  I‚Äôve bought for Mihoyo many times, i‚Äôve spent hours upon hours on this game because it really is a fandom I enjoy being in. 

Yet now we have the anniversary and Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt reciprocate their player‚Äôs kindness. New players are granted ‚Äú free 20 pulls‚Äù and supposedly a guaranteed 5 star, when old players get thrown a bone and just deal with it. Mihoyo do better really, i‚Äôve never written reviews but even i‚Äôm upset about this. Millions of people have dedicated themselves to your games and even support your new releases, but we can‚Äôt get free primogems? It‚Äôs all we ask and you get money every single day, yet you‚Äôre throwing concerts (In the middle of Covid-19) and making music videos advertising your game when you don‚Äôt even respect what you have. 

This is obviously my opinion and if any new players are researching this i do advise you think about it before playing, sometimes even why you play you can lose interest and thats ok! But really think about devoting yourself to the game, because after a years worth of playing and progress ive made along the way doesn‚Äôt even seem worth it now.
I need to see better Mihoyo, really.

-Sunny :)",1
"Genshin is amazing don‚Äôt get me wrong, but there is one minor problem I have. That is that it takes up a lot of space on my device. I play on an I pad, and it runs great, yes. I have multiple other games on my I pad to so whenever I try to update genshin to fir the newest update AND to keep playing it, I end up getting a notification that I do not have enough space on my device. So then I end up having to delete a lot of other games and things I have in my I pad just to keep playing genshin, and most of the time I end up having to delete more important things on my I pad because I still will not have enough space. It‚Äôs a real bummer that I have to clean up a lot of space just to keep playing genshin. Yes I know it‚Äôs a great game and has great graphics yet its a real bummer having to do that.",4
"The game is fun when you sink a lot of money into it, and I think that's the purpose.

The story takes too long to get through, then when you do get through it, you're stuck walking around the entire map trying to find chests or fighting the same boss for the tenth time that day to get materials to level up your character and/or weapons. (Items you can conveniently buy in the store)

The event menus get confusing because they put lock symbols over both parts that will come in a few days and parts that need a requisite mission (however if you've seen the message of ""available in 2 days"" before clicking on an event that needs a requisite mission, you often assume it's just gonna be available in a few days)

The characters started out pretty strong, you can remember them. However, newer characters? They don't feel as though they have unique personalities, they feel as though they've reskinned beloved characters hoping to get people to throw their money at the new ones too. It would be more preferable if they focused on the characters they literally don't put into the storyline (like the One black character) than releasing the 10th polearm user.

Overall, I've sunk too much time into this game that I feel like I can't stop or it would've all been wasted. Don't fall into the same trap.",2
"Updated for current patch 2.1 ‚Äî‚Äî
From 1.0 to 1.2 was the greatest time period of Genshin. Everything fell starting with Lantern Rite if you ask me‚Ä¶ The items we received for that event are the same as our current one year celebration, which is sad. I played for a whole year, sat through things I did mot want to play, in hopes that MiHoYo would get better. They did not, and this especially proves it. Get out while you can, since I can only see this game being used as a cash grab for them and their other projects. Want something to change? Quit and watch other people play instead. For me the turning point was the TL being changed to represent the Dendro Archon as using female pronouns. While it could be the English TL team being pepega, if it is real, it just proves how much of a cash grab this game is. Why have a male archon and make little money compared to the 2.8 million Raiden made in 2 days? All in all, only play this game if you won‚Äôt spend any money. They simply do not deserve it.",1
"This game- you have no idea how much its done for me. I used to be sitting around at home doing nothing, bored. And when i started Genshin Impact, everything just became better. There is a MULTITUDE of things to do. People might say ‚Äúoh, finding treasure is to hard, puzzles are too hard, getting good artifacts is too hard‚Äù that‚Äôs exactly what makes this game fun. It makes me want to play non- stop until i get what uve wanted. And people might say this game is to hard for f2ps, it really isn't. Ive spent at least a good hour just looking for treasure and doing little quests and by the end of it I‚Äôve already gained 500 primos. You just have to put your heart and soul into the game if you really want to get everything out of it. Thank you so much!",5
"I really like the game and I would give it five stars ‚Ä¶ but it takes up to much storage. At first it only took up a little but then it asked me ‚ÄúDo you want to get the full blah blah blah‚Äù I said no and then after a while it asked again. I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Then it said  that my storage was to full and at the time I was pretty low on storage so I deleted A LOT. Then it said I was to low on storage again and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúHow much storage does this need?!?‚Äù I deleted 5 apps, over 100 photos + videos and I finally got it to work ‚Ä¶ IT TOOK UP 8 GB! I liked the game so I kept it than a couple weeks later it said it needed to add something to the game like an update. I said sure. Guess what it said ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have enough storage.‚Äù I recommend this game if your willing to loose a lot of storage. The overall game is amazing but it takes up to much storage.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a few months and I love it. I‚Äôve played 7 hours in one day very many times because I could not put it down. I play on my pc, the graphics are so beautiful and even on mobile they are still better than most games. The character design is so unique and there are so many characters to come. I do not recommend this game if you obsess over characters because you WILL spend your money trying to get your favorite 5 star but you can also be a free to play and still get plenty of characters. The co-op option is a great feature if your friends play and personally I use it a lot, a good thing to note is you can join others worlds that aren‚Äôt your friend if you would like.",5
"i got this game off a recommendation from a friend and i think they created a monster. i‚Äôve had genshin for around 6 months. i‚Äôm AR 42 and could say i have pretty good luck with the gacha system.

the graphics and music are incredible, as well as the team of voice actors. so much thought goes into the lore, world, and characters that it blows me away. i‚Äôm playing on the iphone se 2020 and my game barely lags. my friends with older phones experience some lag, but that‚Äôs to be expected. 

the gacha system- well- i have decent good luck (Diluc, Keqing, Zhongli, Jean) compared to my other friends who play. the game‚Äôs main currency, primogems, can be bought as genesis crystals then converted, or you can grind every day. personally, i‚Äôve never spend a cent on this game (f2p, let‚Äôs gooo) and i think if you‚Äôre willing to work hard and grind, you‚Äôll be fine. 

overall, the level of detail is astonishing. i can‚Äôt imagine ever NOT playing genshin haha. if you have an old phone, you might experience some lag, but genshin impact is 100% worth it. i recommend to anime fans like myself especially because of the japanese voice over ü§å the game is so well done and i love it. thanks mihoyo :D",5
Genshin impact is a great game with good lore and interactive gameplay however the hatch‚Äôs system ruins it. It kills off a players motivation. When you pull for a character there should not be a 50/50 a one in 90 chance is small enough and by putting in 50/50 the chances of getting the character that you want is 1/180 chance. I spent 5 bucks on this game but I‚Äôm not spending a cent more. Why should I? When I know I‚Äôm not even going to get the character that I want. The artifact system is even worse. Not only is it difficult getting the artifact you want impossible to get good stats and substats are a complete scam. RNG ON TOP OF RNG ON TOP OF RNG is too much. The devs should try playing their own game and feel the frustration of grinding weeks only to get a duplicate of a character you don‚Äôt want. Kills off players joy.,4
"Genshin Impact is a straight five stars rate, but it really is sab that you can‚Äôt transfer accounts from phones to the PlayStation.I can bet that their are many players out there wanting to transfer their accounts. For example Someone recently just bought the PS5 and is waiting April28,but has an account in his mobile, he never had a Gaming console before or a gaming PC that wouldn‚Äôt feel great someone working hard for characters and now he won‚Äôt be able to use them on the PS5 so please can we have a crossover or platform transfer you can charge money on that it doesn‚Äôt matter like it‚Äôs not a problem paying ten dollars on that that‚Äôs gonna be worth it.(that will be a win for both sides). And thank you for listening.",5
"When I first played the game I was immediately drawn into it. The gameplay and story are amazing. The RPG elements was well integrated and I‚Äôm expecting more from you guys in the future. Tbh  I wasn‚Äôt expecting that much when I downloaded the game but I was wrong. Anyways just want to say I‚Äôm enjoying your product. Although there‚Äôs some minor or major issues you should fix. First of all the optimization of the game. Not even an hour of gaming in my laptop. Its overheating to the the point that I can feel it on my lap even when the pillows are covered and I could say the same to the iPad. You guys should fix this issue because it doesn‚Äôt only ruin the gameplay of one person but everybody who encounters it. Second, again the optimization. Opening cutscene of the game begins to lag (I was playing it in a brand new iPad). I keep on exiting just to have a decent cutscene but failed to do so. The other reasons of the problems of this are just optimization. I hope you fix it.",2
"It really does seem like a beautiful game, however, I can‚Äôt fully enjoy it. At first it ran kinda smoothly, the sky and surrounding terrain was completely black, so I couldn‚Äôt see anything besides the area around me. But once I got farther and had to actually fight, my entire screen went black so I couldn‚Äôt see anything. I logged in and out of my account, restarted my tablet, and did whatever I could to see something but my screen is still completely black. I can still run and attack, but I can‚Äôt see anything. The cut screens are also very glitchy, I can‚Äôt watch them without one of them stuttering and shorting out. So I have to log out and log back in every time it does :(
It‚Äôs such a beautiful game, but I really hope some of these bugs get fixed so I can enjoy it. I have an IPad 5th gen, so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the reason why it‚Äôs bugging out, but i really hope this gets worked on in the future.",3
"Alright, so I pre-ordered this game a few months back, and now that I‚Äôm playing it, I‚Äôve noticed a few things. It feels, and plays, like a retextured version, of Zelda Breath Of The Wild! I‚Äôll list a couple of things I noticed...

1. The stamina bar, works exactly like the Zelda games‚Äô stamina bar, and when you climb something, it‚Äôs undoubtedly similar.

2. The storyline is even similar, a person who is close to the protagonist, gets captured by this godlike being, and it‚Äôs your job to rescue that person.

3. The game has gliders, literally gliders, they function the exact way the gliders in Zelda do.

4. When you switch over to a different character, such as someone with a bow, it works the same way as in Zelda, and with a tank class, if you hold down the attack button, it will send you spinning as a special attack, and eats up your stamina, oh, and guess what? It works the same way as Zelda.

5. The enemies? They almost aren‚Äôt even retextured, they just all look the same as the enemies from Zelda.

6. The game, is fun, and has an engaging storyline nevertheless, but it only has so little unique features to not get a lawsuit from Nintendo. Overall, fun game, but a little sus on the original side.

"I‚Äôve only been playing for two or so months, but it is an amazing game. It is fun, interactive, and immersive. Some things aren‚Äôt great, (lag, crashes, etc.) but other then that, it has been one of the best games that I have come across. I play it when I‚Äôm bored, or have free time, and it makes me feel like I‚Äôve kind-of escaped reality. If I‚Äôd had a rough day, I could just log onto Genshin and then suddenly I would feel better. One thing that I think could improve the game - other than bug fixes - is better representation. There are only (forgive me if I‚Äôm wrong) 5 or so people of colour, and that annoys me a little. That is pretty much all that‚Äôs on my mind, so I‚Äôd better stop writing before this turns into a rant.",5
"It was just and Idea I had when I was drawing my Oc‚Äôs as Genshin characters. I came across a few of my Oc‚Äôs where their quirk ( YES yes MHA ) Wouldn‚Äôt get along with any of the powers in the og game. My oc Saki‚Äôs quirk is Blood art and I couldn‚Äôt find any that would match her quirk. So I created the ‚ÄúBloodio‚Äù. It‚Äôs for some of my Oc‚Äôs who use blood or depend on it for their quirk. 

My next Oc is named Kaito. Her quirk is ‚ÄúStargate‚Äù. Basically she has the power of summoning Zodiac related things. So I also invented ‚ÄúGalaxio‚Äù. It was for my Oc‚Äôs who use galaxy/space related things.

My other Oc is named Colleii (I REALLY LOVED HER NAME) and her quirk is ‚ÄúGlitch‚Äù. Again none of the OG games powers worked, so I made ‚ÄúGlitchio‚Äù. This one is kinda powerful but I was proud of it. Example: Minor attacks=Anemo. Etc.

I‚Äôm very tired from all the typing, So I won‚Äôt tell you which Oc I used to create this. ‚ÄúClockeo‚Äù is technically a time power thing. Example: The Character can stop time for five seconds while attacking an enemy. Nothing happens to the enemy but when time continues the enemy dies (Depending on how much damage they put).

And if you want to create more powers, I‚Äôd love it. (P.S can you maybe add more weapons. Like a very powerful yo-yo?)",5
"One of the best open world games I‚Äôve ever played. There is an actual story and the fun part is, alot of plot twists. I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy it so much and here I am, dedicating an hour into the game to do some quests. 

Now, it does get repetitive especially when you finish major quests and don‚Äôt have anything else to do other than daily quests. But there‚Äôs much to explore and personally I think the game is more for the casual players who prefer relaxing games.

If you‚Äôre more of a hardcore player (video games lover I guess) then you might want to look the other way because I‚Äôve seen too many constantly complaining on the lack of game content when Genshin is still primarily a mobile game (playable on PC and PS4/PS5). 

I do wish there was a better gender ratio for the gacha characters. The game isn‚Äôt just made for wife simps; it‚Äôs massive because there‚Äôs all gender players playing. It would be nice if they released more male characters and also make more of them more ‚Äòbroken‚Äô like the female characters. After playing for some time I kinda realized the males had more broken support and barely any good DPS, so please consider this Hoyo.",5
It‚Äôs great love the game and all but the loading into the game takes forever I took the 3 freaking days too get into the game if you where gonna make a game as amazing as thins it‚Äôs needs too load better and the ads are a bit too much and I would like a choice for your gender too me all I can be is a boy and that‚Äôs fine en all but it needs too have like a gender pick for you too be a boy or a girl option and I think maybe just maybe when you bet a level or something like that you get like another character of some sort but besides my off spring opinion great app totally recommend it great rpg game I have ever seen just if you get it take the time too let it load it might take a while but just a take the time too let it load up then it will be perfect ü§©,4
takes up a whole bunch of storage ü§®üòï and now i gotta delete a lotta stuff so it will load!!!!!!!like!!!!!!ü§ìüòï anyway it‚Äôs great the characters get watered down a little too much due to the travelers savior complex/hj pls writers write better charactersüôèüôèalso why are they all ytüò¢üò¢üò¢ like this is rlly bootay i hate it esp w them new characters WHY SRE THEY ALL YT‚Ä¶THEYRE SOUTH ASIAN‚Ä¶.and obv there are pale south asians but imma b real w u only having 2 black characters is rlly the bare minimum we rlly expected more of u lolüí®  please listen to the people who are keeping u with money requests bc at one point you‚Äôre gonna at some point your game is is gonna flop the same way your non existent dad did after i was under his sheets. also your fan base are mostly nerds 60% you guys are like league of legends 2.0 LMAOO but otherwise it‚Äôs ok the lore is decent even if you can see it falling out n sh,3
"Genshin is a alright game but only having pale characters is unfair and honestly annoying. Out of like 50 characters we have what less then 5 dark skinned characters. Not every poc has dark skin, yes, but their are a major portion that does have dark skin/tanned skin and they deserve rep just like everyone else has. Also one of the dark skinned characters (Xinyan) is a sterotype loud, scary, and is an outcast is disgusting. A whole new region and ONE dark skinned character is gross, It‚Äôs honestly true that hoyoverse only cares about money and will do whatever it takes to get that money even if it means harmful stenotypes, not caring about their fanbases feelings, etc‚Ä¶ Its gross and your a billion dollar company who can afford to do research but yet you won‚Äôt and why is that? Because you‚Äôre lazy and as long as you‚Äôre making money nothing else matters right???? You‚Äôre gonna lose a lot of your player base unless you guys decide you FINALLY want to change and better yourself.",1
"I‚Äôve been an avid player since April 2021, have put hundreds of hours into this game and log in daily - it‚Äôs safe to say that I‚Äôm really passionate about genshin impact. yeah, I love the game as a whole, but among other issues such as little to no endgame content being added, there‚Äôs one more thing that sticks out.

everyone‚Äôs seen the sumeru leaks. usually I don‚Äôt stoop so low as to leave one star reviews for petty matters, but unlike the one year anniversary incident, this isn‚Äôt petty. this is about representation and blatant disrespect for middle eastern culture. I should never have held such high expectations for hoyoverse or the release of sumeru. the disappointment I feel is on me for having those expectations in the first place, especially when they‚Äôre directed at a company that shows no regard for variety in skin tone whatsoever, but I‚Äôm not alone in feeling it. all I can say is this: hoyoverse, do better. do your research before basing a whole nation off of real people and real cultures.",1
"I like the game it‚Äôs okay, I played it for a couple hours yesterday the one thing I hate is that my character doesn‚Äôt really talk and paimon talks for you which is kind of annoying and you can‚Äôt change character skin- very disappointing how you can‚Äôt change like clothes either and only characters with different powers/elemental powers. I believe if you guys would grow the dressing room idea even more you‚Äôd had more people playing this game. Kinda very disappointing but it‚Äôs a good open world game, surprisingly had no glitches or anything playing on mobile device.

UPDATE: I LEFT THE GAME FOR A WEEK BECAUSE THERES A STUPID QUEST TO COOK AND TWO PEOPLE WERE TALKING WAYYY TOO LONG- 
AND YALL DELETE MY PROGRESS???? Never downloading this game again. U just made me lose interest. Can‚Äôt believe it. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the game is annoying anyways.",3
"i really REALLY love this game. ofc there are some issues here and there but i couldn‚Äôt bare to give this game anything below 5 stars. the one thing i do have to mention is the storage problem on small devices. genshin takes up A LOT of my storage and i don‚Äôt have room for anything else. it‚Äôs a major problem that might even make someone have to quit because they can‚Äôt access genshin on any other device. this game is amazing but this is a very serious issue. i hope i‚Äôm later versions, they will do something about it but as for right now, it is a big hindrance. with all that said, i still think this game is phenomenal and very addictive. either that or i just have a gambling problem üò≠",5
"Yes the game takes up a lot of space but it‚Äôs really worth it. I mean- the lore is amazing and there‚Äôs little pieces of hidden stories if somebody took time to look into. Sure the gacha system might not give you what you want (me who lost every 50/50) but there‚Äôs always a rerun of characters. Some people just don‚Äôt have patience. The whole world exploring is fun and the quests are challenging to give you a actual experience that you won‚Äôt forget in a while. The cutscenes are amazing and the drawing animations are smooth! Though if you really want to download it make sure you have enough space, and also the games full story isn‚Äôt finish yet, just a heads up (and once you finish it all the grinding is kinda pain but it‚Äôs worth it)",5
"So you see I used to play this game 24/7 but then had a couple issues. I remember when I started the game I made an account with a temporary email from this website to test the game out, then I got addicted and got some good characters. Sure that sounds good but I eventually logged out of geshin because it took up too much storage and I saved my account with Apple ID. Afterwards when I tried logging back in with my new fresh storage device I had to verify my email and it wasn‚Äôt mine anyway it was a temporary one. I logged in through Apple ID trying again and I still had to verify the email that I forgot the password of and was temporary. 

That was my problem but not to mention how much storage it takes up for your average mobile device user. Though if you play on PC you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems with it.",3
I love the game. It‚Äôs fun and keeps me entertained with tons of quests and things to do. But I never like to spend my money on it. The only reason I spend money on this game is to get ‚Äúwish‚Äù. Although I have learned not to do this because it is not guaranteed to give you the thing you want which is the point of it I know but this idea would be a nice thing to add. (I have run into getting at least 1 character when I do 10 wish.). It would be nice if the developers would make it so there is a button on each wish thing where if you click to you can view all the things you can get. If you want one of these items you would click it and buy it. But instead of the specific item costing 1 wish it would cost 3. So it basically costs more to straight up buy a character or item.,3
"This is getting out of control. The game is amazing. Beautiful, it has so much dedication and effort. It‚Äôs mesmerizing the amount of work put into it.
The reason it has so many bad reviews it‚Äôs mainly because some days ago it was the anniversary, they left us with too little and after all the critics, they gave us many wishes and memorable objects. They also prepared a full concert with many bands and a full orchestra to celebrate. As well as many raffles. 
Since they did that, everyone who is still complaining is just a greedy and toxic player who does not deserve to play the game, sincerely. I never thought I was going to come to the point of defending Mihoyo. Some players just don‚Äôt deserve this game.",5
"I write this on the game‚Äôs first anniversary, during the midst of that public relations debacle. I have played every day for over 6 months, and have in doing so completed every bit of content in the game, spending a little along the way to support the developer. Playing free is definitely doable, and would still grant a rewarding experience to anyone that does so - until you reach the nonexistent end game.

Yes the game is still in persistent development, and new content is being added regularly. However, there are many missing elements that are basics in modern games of this type, and has almost a complete lack of end game content! I submit ideas and changes regularly as feedback. With the resources the developer has accrued from their first year I sincerely hope they begin addressing content problems instead of continuing their marketing blitz.",3
"ive been playing this game since a few days after is came out in 2020 and mihoyo has got to be the greediest company i have ever seen in my life. this game is NOT f2p friendly in any sense of the word, and these recent anniversary gifts are just a joke. for those unaware, they locked the community rewards behind a gacha in which you have to provide free art and/or promotion of some way in order to enter (said community rewards are not even enough for one single pull). the in game rewards you ask? one 10 pull that you have to wait 7 days to get. 10 pulls in this game is literally just 9 dupes of three star weapons and a dupe of a 4 star character if you‚Äôre LUCKY. they know what they‚Äôre doing and they‚Äôre actively silencing and ignoring fans from all over the world who are upset about it. if you want to play a game that ACTUALLY cares about their playerbase, i suggest dragalia lost and cookie run. despite being gacha games, they‚Äôre still eons more appreciative than mihoyo.",1
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game! The storyline is immersive and incredibly interactive, as well as all the character‚Äôs personal stories. The combat is super cool, but sometimes hard to avoid. Some quest dialogues and cutscenes take too long, but the character development is stunning. I wish that there could be reruns more often, and character‚Äôs special weapons and characters could be a 2-in-1 pack. 

!!! PLEASE READ !!!

I really do wish that there could be character trials/testing all the time. Not just for banners or new characters, not rotating characters, but all the time. The way it would work is whenever you go to the character archive, and click on a character, there should be an option to ‚Äútest character‚Äù, and get to choose how they would be at specific ascension phases. Thank you!",4
Well there not really problems but they can be a little annoying so I first thing I noticed is that sometimes characters will infer to you as he/him or they will say Princess instead of Prince in some dialogue but this only happens if you playe as the girl not sure about the boy tho again this is not a big problem it just confused me when I first noticed.( tho I think this is because your supposed to choose the boy as the character you play as so maybe that is why if so I feel like playing as the girl should not be an option) but that is all overall the game is super fun and have good characters also wonderful voice acting.(also sometimes the dialogue just cuts out when characters are talking),5
"I like the elements and their reactions, I have been looking for a game like this for a long time. When I played it, I did the enjoy this game for the first day, so I start the ‚Äòlottery‚Äô, and that‚Äôs when my nightmare began. 
Can you imagine that you spend 100$ and you cannot even get a 5 star character? BTW you not only have to do ‚Äòlottery‚Äô for new characters, you should also do the same thing for weapons! That‚Äôs crazy, I spent about 500$ for this game yet I only have a 5 star character and a five star book(weapon), and if I don‚Äôt spend more, I cannot continue the adventure, I will get killed by the monsters in open world.. This is just..crazy!
If you really want to play, I suggest you download this game, and just play it with given characters, don‚Äôt ever spend anything for it, it‚Äôs not worth it. This game is so boring after the first few days, you just keep doing the same thing everyday, the rewards you get in open world is minimal, cannot compare with what you get from lottery and quests.",1
"I have not once sat down to write a review before, but I just had to just this once. I don‚Äôt normally play games on my iPad but when i do i like simple and easy/challenging games. This game is the complete opposite of that, this game is adventurous and the visuals are outstanding. This game truly makes Nintendo look stupid. With the power of this iPad 60fps RPG type games are a must and this is one of the best ones i have ever played. I‚Äôd recommend this to anyone of all ages especially adults. Thank you for making this well designed game, I hope other companies see how amazing this game is and they try to make an even better one. Sooner later we will have full fledged console like games on iPads and such and that‚Äôs very exciting. Nonetheless great game i have enjoyed playing it thus far!",5
"I‚Äôve got to say this game has taken most of my time in the past couple days since launch. The graphics and quality of this game is incredible. I expected a more pay to win system in genshin because of the gacha rolling system they have but, it really isn‚Äôt. The one thing that sets thsi game apart from other games is that it is free to play completely. Leveling up and getting far in the game is all up to how much time you put to the game. The only thing pay to win players get from the gacha is 5 star weapons and characters. If you grind enough or have a exponential amount of luck, the game is very blessing in giving you rolls to get new characters. If they added a more co-op experience then what it is now, it would 100% be known as the best free to play open world games out there.",5
I‚Äôve played since around release but took a break and joined on the first Windblume 2021. Since then I‚Äôve made friends through the game playing with them in co-op and more. The story is beautiful and leaves you waiting for more. The designs of almost everything are amazing of course skin tone could use more variety but over all I believe it‚Äôs great. Every time a new character is released I‚Äôm always amazed by how unique they are. I‚Äôm even more amazed how each nation is based on a different culture. What‚Äôs better is the game isn‚Äôt done yet in fact very far from it. I‚Äôm excited to be here till the end. This game as silly as it sounds holds a special place in my heart for all the friends and experiences I have made through this game.,5
"Genshin Impact is a wonderful game, and is wonderfully put together. The gameplay is amazing and the graphics are stunning. However, after reading these reviews I‚Äôve noticed one very common thread: After AR 45 it gets boring and repetitive. As someone who is now Adventure Rank 54 I can say that at one point this was partially true. However as of recently, I‚Äôve found myself drowning in quests and storylines that I need to do and having no Idea where to start. This is not mean negatively at all, by the way. Although I‚Äôm also a player that doesn‚Äôt have to much free time to play the game, but I do think that as of recently genshin has been putting a lot of effort into keeping the game from getting boring and repetitive.",5
"I started playing Genshin back in February and been obsessed ever since! I really wish there was more customization tho. Kinda like Tower of Fantasy. Like maybe an event where you make an artificial human (similar to Albedo) and then you get to customize it. You also have a few attacking presets for that character to use depending on what weapon they use. You also get to choose the weapon like bow, sword, etc. It would be realllllly cool if Hoyoverse adds more customization. But it would also be nice if they had better endgame content, more chances of getting better artifacts, more resin, more primogems (like a login thing in game), and more chances of getting the character you want. But overall, it‚Äôs a good game.",5
"I enjoy playing this game but the characters, especially the new characters of the newest nation Sumeru, need work. There are very few characters with ‚Äúdark‚Äù skin. They‚Äôre only considered to be dark skin because they aren‚Äôt a shade of pale white, like the majority of the characters are. The new Sumeru teaser disappointed me extremely, there are many new characters with only 2 tanned ones. Not to mention the colorism this company has, as their only darker skinned characters constantly get white washed in official art, and get barely any screen time. Take Xinyan, a character of Liyue for example. Not only does she get white washed in official art, but she gets barely any screen time in the game and only gets featured during limited time events. In conclusion, if you‚Äôre going to make a game with many different countries, represent the citizens of them correctly.",3
"I love this game a ton, and have been playing for a few months. I am absolutely astonished by the graphics and details this game has in stock, and the plot and characters are super interesting. The only things that i would say aren't exactly satisfactory are, 1: getting characters. getting characters that are less rare (4*) is easy, but when it comes to getting a limited character (5*), the gacha rates are t e r r i b l e. If you do your daily commissions for a year, you still have only ONE five star character guaranteed. 2: The artifact system. This is a good system, but it is really hard to get anything you want with it, sometimes taking hours to get even one good artifact. Other than these, the game is amazing, with tons of interesting plot lines and amazing character designs. Overall an amazing game! :)",4
"Hello, my name is Sunshine and I am a world renowned Fumo enthusiast. I would like to comment on your game but also make a small inquiry about the character Arataki Itto.
He is a truly amazing character, not to mention how well designed he is, from his beautiful crimson horns to his adorable back ribbon. He is truly amazing. Anyways, about the game, it‚Äôs a very good game in my opinion of course. The attention to detail on each character is astonishing, did I mention Itto‚Äôs lovely nails? Their very pretty, speaking of pretty, Itto‚Äôs eyes are so beautiful. It‚Äôs so mesmerizing to look at. I could look at Itto everyday all day long. I love Itto so much. I will become Itto‚Äôs wife. Maybe I shall become Sunshine Arataki. Yes, I am signing the papers right now and planning the wedding. We are now officially married.",5
"I downloaded genshin impact around when Klee came out. At first I didn‚Äôt know how to play. I think mihoyo could put more clear instructions in this game. But overall also my fault for not reading everything. After everything became clear I started playing 24/7. It was my way of escaping reality. I have played over a year and I still love it. I admit I do take breaks sometimes, but I do comeback. Overall this game is Fantastic, the story is very interesting. Every character is either cute, pretty, or handsome. Building the characters is very difficult, but I mostly farm with friends so it makes it fun. All the places you go is very beautiful, the music is amazing. I love this game and hope that the fandom could be less toxic.",5
This game is amazing I love and adore it I love the characters they have so much personality and the storyline is just the cherry on top it so much fun to play i would recommend if your only playing for the game itself but‚Ä¶the thing that bother me is that it‚Äôs hella hard to get a certain character let‚Äôs say raiden shogun you need to pull 50 times to get somewhat close to the character you want and your not even granted to get her you just have get lucky and it‚Äôs hella hard to even get 50 cause your daily commission only give you 60 which just blows my mind for a game that made so much money I think about 1b only on mobile I think it can waste a bit of pixels to give us a 10 pull or so even like 5 pulls this game just knows way to milk peoples money making them waste money,4
"Genshin Impact has been one of my favorite games to play in the past year. The characters, lore, story, and gameplay are all 10/10. The combat and exploration are insane and it is hard to believe this can be played on an iPhone. With that being said, I do feel that us players deserve more rewards in game, especially for the 1st year anniversary. Miuhoyo can spare us a free five star and a couple of Multis but I digress. This game is an amazing ride and I highly recommend anyone to pick it up if you‚Äôre looking for a game to put a lot of time into. Make sure you don‚Äôt over spend because it can be tempting. My favorite character so far is Tartaglia and every character is different and super interesting. Again, I highly recommend it.",5
"Genshin impact is a exciting and relaxing game to play don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I just feel like it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give out better rewards. It is Genshin Impact 1st anniversary and it only got this far thanks to all the players even if they are free to play. Personally for me what I enjoy from Genshin the most is grinding and getting new characters that is what motivating me to keep playing, but how stingy Mihoyo is with their rewards it is making me tired of playing because there is no motivation to keep playing. Endgame for me is getting boring, I mostly get on to spend resin and do commissions and go, it almost feel like chores to login and play. I hate to admit it but it is the truth for me and many other players I know. I still have hope for Mihoyo and I hope that they take players opinions and suggestions into their consideration. Genshin still have lots to improve on.",3
"Have loved Genshin Impact since I started playing a few weeks ago! Great graphics, fun story, excellent voice acting, and challenging mechanics.  And it doesn‚Äôt seem to be P2W (pay to win). The gachas are, at least, clearly explained. And the translations are done with cultural sensitivity so they make sense and are often quite eloquent. 

My only gripe is the controller interface. I‚Äôve played a number of these style of games on my phone and the joystick on Genshin is incredibly frustrating. I‚Äôm really hoping the devs read these reviews and fix it. It prevents any sort of accuracy in your movements and is often so frustrating I stop playing or avoid certain quests. 

But the game has been enjoyable enough to keep playing despite that rather large issue. Highly recommend.",4
"I got this game because my friend wanted me to start playing it, at first I didn‚Äôt know what to do AT ALL, it starts off a bit confusing but the game is honestly amazing. When I first got it I couldn‚Äôt stop playing it. Once you reach AR 16 and able go play with friends, it‚Äôs honestly so much better! This game is amazing and you should totally get it. The characters, design, and the graphics are amazing. Every single detail put into this game amazes me. The only minor complaint is that my playstation info cannot be transferred into the mobile version, but that‚Äôs alright! I really don‚Äôt mind. Another complaint is that it takes up SO much storageüò≠üíî That‚Äôs alright though, but yeah‚Ä¶ Before you get the game be aware that your storage might just go üòµ",5
"This game has been ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, and still is. As if late though, it has been ‚ú®hawt‚ú®. Before a character called ""Klee"" came out for a rerun, I have been saving MANY Primogems (Special Currency) in order to receive this AMAZING character. As I click the 10 pull button (10 Wishes) I realize the wish wasn‚Äôt blue nor purple-ish pink. It was a five star character. I look at the screen not taking a second to look away. As I slowly click I see Barbra, then Sucrose, but when I click once more I couldn‚Äôt believe me eyes. I. Got. KLEE. As I a slowly realize I just got a five star, I immediately went to give Klee her Artifacts and a Weapon. I truly believe that this game has a crush on me, üòè Anyways if you‚Äôre reading this review, I‚Äôm passing on my five-star luck to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Wow. Just wow. I'm not at all a fan of Anime/Japanese style RPGs, but this game is incredible! Graphics are gorgeous. Movement and combat are well polished. Story and writing are good, and the English is perfect. And the attention to detail throughout the game is superb! Being able to really go anywhere - climb walls to the tops of buildings (and then glide down from them!), get on top of tree stumps, sit on benches, climb cliffsides, swim in rivers, anything - is awesome! And being able to attack and damage many things in the world too, not just barrels üòù.

And no auto quest completion, movement, combat (that I've seen so far anyway)!! üòÄ

This is how you do an RPG!

I think the only complaint I have so far is being able to level up from items - to me, coming from an old school RPG background, that's just a cheap way to do it. Doesn't require any skill or thought (unless they make it so the items can only be acquired through combat, completing quests, exploring, and character interaction/diplomacy, but so far I've seen the items delivered in mail as gifts). I know that's how games are done these days to keep the kiddies hooked, but really, this game already has so much in it to keep you interested, I don't think that element is necessary.",5
"Ok so when I try playing the game on my iPad, the cutscene at the start is INCREDIBLY laggy, to the point where it stays on a frame, and you can hear the characters talking, speaking of which, the audio keeps stuttering, and basically its very laggy, but when I got into the tutorial where you can walk around, there was a certain view distance where anything outside of that view distance is just pitch black. Also its really laggy too. My patience ran out and I deleted the game out of frustration. Other than that, if you can run the game without any issues, I think it will be an amazing game. I am very Very VERY mad that I couldn‚Äôt experience the game in it‚Äôs fullest potential as I was one of people that played the other impact game, Honkai Impact, and that game was awesome. I hope you fix this soon, Mihoyo. I will still play, on computer, but I wish to see on my iPad, as i can play it more often.",3
"I would like to say this game is great. Is has beautiful graphics, interesting lore & characters, and good gameplay. I honestly think this mobile game is one of the best. But you guys have major issues. The gacha system is very unfair and not well made. The gems already coast so much, and most of the time you just get a 4 star item. Also the way you do banners is odd. Many characters need reruns but don‚Äôt get them. And characters that don‚Äôt get them. But my main issue is the character designs. You sexualize almost all the female characters, including some of the younger ones. And you also whitewash POC characters. You barely have any POC characters. You guys have horrible rep. I think over all you guys have a very good game, but it has major issues. Hopefully in the future you can fix this.",4
So I just got this game and the thing I noticed first was the fact that I have a black sphere around me blocking my vision from a contain raids even in cut scenes like I could only see the blue dragon when it almost hit my character or what ever all I‚Äôm saying is that game is really fun but I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm doing and the lag is insane for mobile so please for the love of god just make it so I can see the game I‚Äôm trying to play also this started happening as soon as I started when I picked my twin I made two different accounts to see if there was just a bug that happened but it was the same for both accounts I also picked the make for both so that could be the problem but I‚Äôm not sure anyway please make it so I can see thanks,5
I ask this because I love this game and my friends would prolly too. But they won‚Äôt play if they can‚Äôt play with me. This game can stand on its own completely solo but my friends won‚Äôt play this game for HOURS just to play with me. And they already have a slight distaste for gatcha games so they won‚Äôt spend hours to get to the rank to finally be able to play with me. And I love playing this game and want to play with someone else but everyone else is a complete stranger and I want to play this game with my friend. At least let higher level players play with their friends of lower level so they can have like a mentor type of status or something. Because having to play for hours before being able to play with a friend isn‚Äôt worth it.,5
"bruh, this is the first time i see a real game that is not auto-play. i can't even stop thinking about it how they made this (ü•≥Real game happend!!!ü•≥) im so blown away. i keep telling myself how they even fit a game like this into a phone!!!üò± Well anyway this a really good game i think everyone should give it a chance and see if this game is right for u. im not going to give anything out so u can play and find out for your-self, see if you like open world games without the annoying (""ads"") that most mmorpg do most of the time just after ur money. i see this a time killer game also very Addictive if ur into open wolrd games to explore. without being said Thank-you Genshin-impact for making this Crazy Cool game!!!üòé

I love it :D",5
"It‚Äôs free to play, but it‚Äôs also pay to win.  If you wanted to get the character you desire and max its level and constellations, it would cost you $1,500 worth of primogems.  That doesn‚Äôt even include a top tier weapon or the best artifacts to make the character powerful.  Of course you get free currency as you play, but you‚Äôd have to play for years to significantly gain. It‚Äôs quite sickening how little you get for the money they charge, but apparently enough people fall for it.  You can‚Äôt customize characters and not every character has an alternate costume, either.  

Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a fun game with great graphics and stories that never end. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúwinning‚Äù the game, only the battles and challenges, but then what happens to all your assets when the game finally comes to the end of its lifespan? You never really own anything.  It‚Äôs a game.",3
Love the game I have been playing for about 3 months now and have had a lot of fun. A big problem though is free to play players get screwed over. I play about 2 to 3 hours every day and I only have 4 legendary characters. It is extremely frustrating when you play all the time but bearly get anything back. Not only that but I'm at AR rank 48 and theres nothing left to do i finished all of inazumes quest which took me about 4 days and now im back to just waiting for events and doing commissions. Not only that it takes forever for resin to regenerate. For a free game it really makes you pay money to progress at all  and don't get me wrong its a really fun game at the start but later in the game it gets really boring. Just wish they would add more stuff and more chances to get primogems.,4
I love this game so much and I play it all the time. I love all of the characters weapons gameplay game style and I love that you can just throw them and play a drone pace and innocent Ober world type of game I looked for a type of game for this for so long but the only thing I have the problem with Genshin is that free to play paleiers can‚Äôt get that many primo gems for one of my friends they don‚Äôt spend any money and it takes them a very long time to get a five star character so overall this game is really good really fun and I hope you will do download it but the only problem is that for three player players it‚Äôs really hard for them to get primo gems to get new characters and a lot of people want hu tao plz let her have a re run,5
"This game used to be the only game I would play. I would play it literally all the time, but after a couple months of playing I deleted it. After playing it I realize ITS KIND OF A PAY TO WIN TYPE GAME. You can still be a F2P but it‚Äôs not fun. If you don‚Äôt spend any money then it‚Äôs  almost impossible to level up characters and have fun. I love this game and the characters are cool and creative. But I have a problem. There‚Äôs only one black character???? Can we pleaseeeeeeee get some representation? Anyways, it was a fun game but in my opinion it‚Äôs not worth playing all the time just to still be bad at the game. If you‚Äôre willing to become an absolute whale then go ahead Genshin is great for you, but if you‚Äôre looking for a fun F2P game then you‚Äôll  be bored and frustrated out of your mind.

P.S Genshin is a F2P game, but if you want to get really good you have to spend a lot of money or spend every waking hour on the game. It‚Äôs just not worth my time to work all time on this dumb gacha game.",1
"Overall Genshin is a great game so many features and characters to achieve. The map is throughout and flawless. The character designs are unique and beautiful! And it‚Äôs great with all the quests! I just have two problems, one being the wishing. Wishing is a way to earn your characters, yet at the beginning of the game it is a little challenging to get wishes as well as when you progress it still is hard to get wishes without buying them. Another is leveling up, when you are working your way to adventure rank 10, there is a quest were you need to get the Anmo statue to a certain level. It is VERY hard to find the things to get this quest done and over with. Also just something to add, I love Yae Miko‚Äôs character design üíóüíó",5
This is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played in my life but I have a hard time logging in sometimes but I find out a way how to do it. Like right now in the 2.6 update it won‚Äôt let me in and In the App Store it does not say update and me and my mom can‚Äôt find out how to get it to stop. I have waited all day since like 3:50 but this game is still really fun. I‚Äôll ask my friends who play Genshin if they could help me because they are able to play right now. I‚Äôve been in character banner update and I never have had troubles going into Genshin. But I‚Äôll find out how to play it. If you read reviews you should get this game immediately it a best game ever right behind a game I play like this one (it‚Äôs an anime game). Mihoyo/Hoyovers did a great job.,5
The game is fun at first but when you go deeper into the game you complete things which leaves you with nothing to do.  It gets boring but you never want to delete the game you delete your whole life for this game but of course you‚Äôd aid it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs more like an addiction rather than a care free game. The game has a fun side to it like hangout events and story quest from the characters which let you know more about them. Genshin always has events so you can keep playing the game. It also has a story line where you try to find your twin so your going across nations to find your twin and stop him from what you think Is the evil. Every time there is a version update Celestia keeps falling down why?,5
"I really want to play this game, the only chance I had to play this game was when I went to a pc cafe. I tried to download on my computer but it takes up was to much storage that I can‚Äôt. The only other option I can do it to play on my phone and I got really excited because luckily I hav enough storage ones I deleted a few games I don‚Äôt play anymore, but as soon as I tap to play the game crashes and I can‚Äôt even get in to play at all. It‚Äôs really frustrating because I been waiting to play this for a while even before I went to the pc cafe but never had the device to play on but I really been wanting to play. It‚Äôs just really upsetting I‚Äôll try again a few more time but if it keeps crashing then I might have to delete more stuff so it can have enough storage to run the game. I will come back to this review if I get it the game and can play",2
"I‚Äôve been playing the game since launch and have consistently bought gnostic chorus every time it was available, every time I would get a name card, special weapons only accessible when buying the chorus, and some other stuff.  Along with it came an additional 20 levels boost for the battle pass. 

I would always finish up my battle pass around lvl 30 and buy the chorus and it would finish the battle pass at max level (50). I recently bought the chorus and didn‚Äôt check on the update and notice that they were only giving out a 10 level boost instead of 20, but they still charged me about $20 in USD. 

I‚Äôve spent a good amount of money on the game and I kinda expect my money to be worth my while, but as of late it‚Äôs been really disheartening to see that the Genshin branch,  is starting to prioritize money instead of their players. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be writing a review if it was only about them charging me more for less than before, but it has become more about the Genshin branch and their questionable decisions.

P. S. The same can‚Äôt be said about Honkai, a game by mihoyo that I‚Äôve also been playing since launch.",5
"This game is amazing, from the map to the storyline to the events. Everything is so well thought and put out, though the newer stories are a bit rash but still good. I don‚Äôt understand why some people are so mad over the anniversary rewards, it‚Äôs not that bad. 10 wishes are fine and even better now since they moved it up to 20 wishes. Everyone who is putting 1 stars for the game, do you guys realize that when Genshin reaches below like 1.5 stars it gets remove? What about the people who still wants to play the game and can only do it on mobile? I swear some of you people are the most hypocritical and selfish people I have ever seen. Like be mindful of it. You may continue to do what you want but you might regret it later.",5
"There is a lack of consistency in production quality. It is clear the company cares greatly for the finer qualities such as artistic design, music production, and lore writing of this game. However, there is such an apparent neglect for the meat-and-potatoes portion of this game such as quality-of-life features, replayable content, meaningful co-op features, and end-game entertainment. There has been virtually no meaningful attempt to improve these aspects of the game for the past year. Many others have expressed frustration about the lack of anniversary pomp or rewards, but I personally don‚Äôt care about that. The company can make their own decisions. However ,the frustrating part is the lack of communication from the developers to address and acknowledge the community‚Äôs gripes. I regret having spent thousands on this game to support a company that appears to care more about milking money than fostering the goodwill of its player base.",2
"Amazing gameplay and I love the world and character designs, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs much more fit for PC. On mobile the game has been lagging more and more frequently with each update (I‚Äôm using an iPhone XR), and people who play on the PS4 say teleporting from area to area takes ages. The game also claims to be 4GB but in reality is over 12GB on my phone, since the 4GB doesn‚Äôt include all the ‚ÄúDocuments & Data‚Äù. Storage-wise this is a nightmare for me since I only have 64GB to start with and I have photos and messages that I would like not to have to delete just to make space. Good news though is that you can switch to playing with your mobile account on a PC, though this doesn‚Äôt work with PS4.

Get the game, just get it on a PC and not another platform!",4
"I‚Äôve only managed to progress as far as I have because I play on pc with a controller. The game is great, and there‚Äôs a lot to like about it but it‚Äôs difficult at best to play on my iPad (and won‚Äôt even launch on my phone, which I get it they recommend an 8s or better but it‚Äôs stupid, in my opinion that I can‚Äôt use my 7 to launch the game at all, I‚Äôd even be happy just playing on the lowest settings but it won‚Äôt even launch.) But even when I can get the controls to work on my iPad it crashes a lot, consistently it‚Äôs crashing when I try to enter the domain for the mondstadt gourmand quest. I would love to be able to play this on my iPad or iPhone so I don‚Äôt have to bring my laptop to work with me when I just want to play for a few minutes at break or lunch, but the crashes make it very difficult to play.",4
"I was downloading this game and it took a few hours a and when I was able to play it said begin adventure and I click start and I saw the background was all pitch black, at first I thought it was the part if the game until I started walking around and this light covered the whole screen and I couldn‚Äôt even see the character and my eyes were hurting. So I decided to delete it and it happened again so I deleted it again and the same results, I‚Äôm not sure if your able to fix it for me but I hope you do soon because I wanna experience a super high quality fun adventure game but yet I didn‚Äôt get to experience any of that the past few days I hope you can fix this for me that would be amazing.",5
"This game has the best graphics I‚Äôve ever seen on a MOBLIE game, and it‚Äôs even more surprising because it‚Äôs a open world RPG.
I first played Genshin on PC and wanted to see what it was like on mobile, so I could play it on the go and I was surprised by the performance. Genshin impact is a high GB game, I know‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs worth the space! I have a 128 GB phone with 6 other high GB games and my phone still runs perfectly fine; even though it may make my phone extremely hot and is a battery-depleting game. The space is worth it, and did I mention it is 100% free to play!?!?

 Even if people spend money and look like they progress far, don‚Äôt take that on you to spend and get addicted into the gacha (yes, this is a gacha game‚Ä¶).

 The characters are so relatable and funny and the voice actors are really good, not to mention the language(s) are well managed! Customer service isn‚Äôt the best, and if you get hacked it‚Äôs hard to get your account back, but it‚Äôs in your possession to do two-step verification.
 All in all, great game, little cons more pros and you have a perfectly well managed time-wasting game at your disposal!

Thank you for reading this lengthy review !!",5
"This game is amazing but there are things like it being to laggy or it takes up to much storage. I always see these one start rating that just says ‚Äúthe developers are racist‚Äù or ‚Äúthis game is racist‚Äù, first of all the developers nor the game is racist. Secondly there are some dark skinned characters in the game. Third of all y‚Äôall probably didn‚Äôt even play the game and when y‚Äôall saw the first light skinned character y‚Äôall wrote a complaint. This game is amazing and just because there are more light skinned characters than dark skinned characters doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be more or that they are racist. It‚Äôs the developers choice to decide what color or race the characters will be. Again, this game is amazing. :)",5
"this app is amazing the best app I own all the characters look so cool but their are bad things to üòøit takes up 10mb and my phone only has 32 and to get primo gem it cost 60 for one wish and for feature characters it is 160 for 1 LIKE WHAT???? daily quest only give u 10 primo gems but you only get like 4 of them ;-; I love all of hoyo veres games including cookie run kingdom and honki impact I would definitely recommend them üëçI get supper lucky in all my games, in cookie run kingdom I got two vanilla cookies two times in a row, people say that vanilla cookie is the hardest to get üòã and in genshin I did my daily‚Äôs and I got a wish and the childe banner was up right and I decided to use my daily primo gems to get a wish so I did and got childe in that first pull ü§©ü§©‚≠êÔ∏è omg the app is so amazing totally recommend it",4
"Hi, first want to start this off by saying it‚Äôs an amazing game! I‚Äôm a F2P player and I‚Äôm addicted to this game. The graphics are amazing, the storyline always has me hooked and the characters are personalized, detailed, and awesome! After getting genshin every other game just never seems to compare for me. However as much as I live this game I also play on mobile‚Ä¶and the problem is that this game takes a lot A LOT of space and I‚Äôm constantly having to offload or delete games to keep it on. Not everyone has the ability to just go out and buy a pc and as much as I love the game I can‚Äôt keep using all the space on my phone to keep it. But overall great game, I‚Äôd just like to see an answer to the space problem!",5
"Where are the darker skinned people? I spent money on this game and surely would‚Äôve spent a lot more if they released realistic skin tones. Not everyone should be pasty. Not only that, but unrealistically pasty, like condensed milk. It‚Äôs just lazy at this point, and I think the developers and the company are cowards. Realistic and Darker skin tones don‚Äôt only appeal and represent plenty of people, it just makes the game far more relatable, even for people like me who have light skin. It‚Äôs repetitive, and not only that, the writing of the game is also repetitive. Game is trash. Will be playing Legend of Zelda botw. Game is low key racist but at least we got more skin colors. Genshin‚Äôs writing is so corny anyway. Felt like I was watching an old, tired sitcom appealing to people with the brains the size of my nostril. 

It‚Äôs not that hard bruh. Plus most of the character‚Äôs color pallets work so harmoniously with darker skin, an incredibly missed opportunity. Game went down the gutter and playing it reminds me of the smell of acid reflux burps. Garbage and spoiled eggs. 

Mechanics are also repetitive. Got old so fast, and I had been playing since the game was released to the United States.

I would rather spend cash buying elephant dung over and over than buying the in game currency for characters I can hardly perceive without wanting to slam my forehead into my knees after jumping off a twelve story building.",1
"I love this game and have been playing since December 2020, thats when Zhongli‚Äôs first banner arrived. I pulled for him and lost the 50/50. I was a beginner at the time so I didn‚Äôt really care but then his second banner came and I wanted to pull for him again. I saved and pulled, and lost the 50/50 (again). Sad, right? And then, Zhongli and Ganyu had a double banner and they‚Äôre both my most wanted characters but I really wanted another dps for the spyral abyss, so I got Ganyu. Now is his fourth rerun and I can only get to around 22 pity (with guaranteed)  so basically i won‚Äôt be able to get him again which is frustrating (so wish me luck!! ). Otherwise, I love the graphics and the characters so keep up the good work!!",5
"First off, I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying that Genshin Impact was my favorite game up until the controversies with Sumeru characters. I tried so very hard to see the good in the company, but I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt overlook the very blatant racism in their choices of skin tones for the characters they create. They are stealing cultures from South Asian and Middle Eastern countries, and applying them (incorrectly) onto white characters. None of the Sumeru characters should be white. I am just so sick and tired of the lack of representation of skin tones in this game, and its disgustingly racist fans on top of it all. Not only are they colorist, they are also using stereotypical traits of cultures and tacking them on to characters (i.e. Dori, etc.) This is just completely disrespectful and offensive to the cultures they are stealing from. This game started off with a very promising future, but seeing how it has gone, If you are looking for proper representation, I don‚Äôt recommend playing this game.",1
"So.. I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while now, nearly about when it first came out. It was fun at first but now the wonder and euphoria I got from the game has subsided. There really isn‚Äôt enough to keep me entertained all the time. You can only do so much in coop and playing single player all the time can get pretty boring. The events are nice sure but those are still limited. Not to mention, Hoyoverse is coming out with a new region, Sumeru. I think Sumeru NEEDS to have proper representation. I want to see people of color. The whole of Sumeru SHOULD NOT be white. Sure, some pale people would be there‚Ä¶ but the whole of Sumeru? I do hope that Hoyoverse listens to their community and adds proper representation of the region. There is no excuse not to add the representation and we should not have to wait until Natlan comes out when we‚Äôre not even guaranteed darker characters for that region either. Considering how this issue has been handled thus far.",1
"For starters, I love Genshin Impact. I love the characters, the lore, the play styles, almost everything about it is so incredible. However, there are a few flaws that make playing a bit of a pain. For starters, the resin system. With a single resin replenishing every twelve minutes, twenty being needed for artifact and material domains, fourth for boss fights, and thirty or sixty on weekly bosses, it all is just a bit to slow. Secondly, the artifact rolling. When a person wishes to farm artifacts, chances are they are going to get a hp or defense one, or perhaps something different in a domain where hp or defense ARE what you want, the algorithm is poised against it. The chances of rolling into crit rate/crit damage is also quite low and it‚Äôs just a royal pain to have to do the same domain over and over again.",4
"I have been playing Genshin Impact since update 1.1. From the moment I loaded into the world, I knew the experience was going to be unlike any other game I have played on mobile. The is SO MUCH CONTENT and the world is filled to the brim with quests and lore for you to experience. 

Characters in the game unique, quirky and surprisingly balanced (except for Bennett, everyone loves Bennett). 4-Star characters are monstrous when built properly (Nigguang, Razor, Rosaria).  Combat is addicting and rewarding. The elemental resonance system encourages players to use unorthodox play-styles and experiment. Did I mention artifacts? Which allow you to customize each individual aspect of your character‚Äôs stats? Like I said before, SO MUCH. 

The micro-transactions are there for those who do not want to grind their life away. Yes, constellations are pay-to-win-ish and make every character infinitely better. But, the rerun banners exist so that free-to-plays can earn them over time too. The game is co-op, buying things only makes you win harder. 

If you are looking for a nearly endless, open-world, beautifully designed action-RPG, definitely give this game a shot!",5
"I love this game so far. I‚Äôve put in probably 5 hours, and it hasn‚Äôt tried to burden me with micro-transactions. The art style is beautiful, and the story is good. Like others have said, it‚Äôs reminiscent of Breath of the Wild, but is far from a copy cat. It manages to stand on its own without relying on the ideas of others.
The only thing I can complain about is the lack of controller support. For a game that has controller mapping on the PC and console versions, it‚Äôs strange to me that the IOS version doesn‚Äôt support it. I have a Steel Series Nimbus controller (along with Xbox controllers) that I could use if the game featured controller support.
With that said, the in-game touch controls aren‚Äôt bad, and the combat feels intuitive. I would still love to see controller support, however.

Thanks so much to the developers for creating this piece of art!",4
"This game is so awesome and fun! But I do have a few complaints.. First of all the pity in the game is insane, 90 wishes just to only get a 50/50 chance for a character ??? Also the rewards in the game are not enough, especially for players that can‚Äôt pay (me). Like most games give you a free 10 pulls for the gacha every update but this game gives you like 300 mora (coins for the game) for a survey and that‚Äôs it- I will say if you just want to have fun download this game but if you want all the characters you‚Äôll be spending a lot of $$ and time on this game. This game will take up all of your storage, like I‚Äôve deleted so many good games for this game and it‚Äôs still not enough. Although the details are so beautiful and there‚Äôs a interesting story to the game it lags sooo much. Overall I‚Äôm surprised how good this game is it just needs some touch ups.",3
"This is by far the best Mobile RPG I've ever played, and the fact that it is cross platform with PC is really amazing.
The history is good, but it seems to go nowhere so far. 
The characters awesome but they are not customizable, you gotta pay to have skins.
I've spent some money on it just to be able to level up quicker and get some extra rolls, but I'm not planning to spend any more on it because the chances of pulling what I need are too low and what you can get spending real money is not that good.
By the amount of surveys they send every month it seems that the devs are trying to listen to the fans, and that's good for the development of the game and Mihoyo's reputation nobody wants another EA Games around.",5
"I absolutely love this game. The characters, the weapons, the story, everything! I think it's a wonderful game filled with breathtaking art and adventures. It's perfect, and my heart belongs to many of the characters. 
 
But one thing. It's very hard for F2P players to get decent characters and weapons. I myself am not F2P, but the fact that it takes 3 days for a F2P player to get enough primogems for one wish is ridiculous. The fact that the pity for a guaranteed 5 star (doesn't count if featured or not) is 90 is absurd, especially since it's so hard for F2P players to get primogems. 

I don't really have any other complaints. The game itself is wonderful. But another fun suggestion would be to add more poses for the Kamera, such as sitting, laying down, etc.",5
"Genshin impact is amazing in my opinion! There‚Äôs a lot for you to do and how much details the characters have in them is unbelievable! But some of the quests that they want you do kinda  is hard if your character isn‚Äôt leveled up enough. And the game takes alot of storage inside of your device your playing on so I think you should play on ps4, Xbox or computer. And getting some of the characters are hard to get but it‚Äôs still a good game. I enjoy wishing! When you wish get characters you can get 4 stars or if your luck.. even 5 stars! And there‚Äôs a lot of area‚Äôs to explore! And the higher the adventure level the more you can do! But in my overall opinion I thing genshin impact is a reall good game!",5
"Okay, I have seen a lot of reviews and I want to put my opinion out. 1. A lot of reviews seem to be saying, ‚Äúthey are sexualizing the girls‚Äù sure some skin is showing but it‚Äôs nothing bad. It‚Äôs mostly fan art of people sexualizing them. 2. A lot of reviews state the game is laggy and takes up space. That could be your phone because it never lags for me. But it may be a laggy game if your an iPad kid idk- also it does take a lotta space but it‚Äôs a good game- 3. The graphics are really nice and the game makes you feel like your in a wonderland full of magic and creativity (which I love!) honestly the stories are fun, and it‚Äôs a great game. Also all the baddies have it so you should get it to üòºüíÖüèª‚ú® if you don‚Äôt get this go die in a ditch bestie.",5
"Dont get me wrong, I love this game a lot and i play it a lot, but one thing that is super duper annoying is the abyss mages shields, and what makes them more annoying is when u have to fight multiple of them in a set amount of time, the most annoying part is when you have to fight 3 cryo abyss mages in 60 seconds, like wth thats too little time and the mages just spam their ice at you continuously freezing all of your characters. It would be nice if they could give their shields less hp and make them easier to break and also if they make the cryo effect of your character removable with fire because I hate the fact that it slows u down and u cant remove it until it goes out on its own, another annoying thing is having cryo and then walking into water and just freezing causing monsters nearby to deal heavy damage for the duration of the feeeze. Mihoyo, if you could please read my review and do something about this I will love the game even more.",1
"So relaxing, and a masterpiece from the graphics and character design. Time simply flies playing this game. Running around on the grass is so peaceful and keep reminding me of sword art online. I see so much potential like the possibility of adding online play with players around the world when technology allows it. A few suggestions would be to not let the game be so easily stopped just by eating food, because every time i eat during a fight, it feels like i‚Äôve already lost. I wish there‚Äôs a little more interactive elements like cutting would and building your own lodge. 
This game already has the graphics potential to evolve to sword art online game, i just want more interactive elements with the open world even if that means it‚Äôs gonna eat my storage.",5
"If I could give it 10 stars I would. I played games for years and never left a review. Genshin deserves a review. After more than a year of playing, this is it: The scene, open world - AMAZING, the music is breathtaking, the characters, the story, beautiful and interesting. The grind can take some time, end game is still out there, but frequent events, updates and new zones, especially this last one, Sumeru, is what keeps me coming back. I am absolutely in love with Sumeru, its story, the characters, I log in and get lost in this world, for me its therapy. I play on my iphone since I don't have time for other consoles and it runs great. Also I never payed a dime on ingame currency, all this totally free. 
Devs keep it up, big fan of your work!",5
"Hello! So far the game has been good! I‚Äôve been waiting for the game release since I found out about it a few weeks ago. I started playing it as soon as it came out but then the actual game doesn‚Äôt show the backgrounds on my phone and iPad. I‚Äôm not sure if it because I have an iPhone 6S+ but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not because of storage. I also tried playing it on my iPad but that too doesn‚Äôt show the backgrounds for me. It doesn‚Äôt really help if the whole screen is black and I‚Äôm not sure what to attack (referring to the dragon slaying scene i suppose). üòÖ I have tried re-downloading it and everything as well but it still doesn‚Äôt show up. But overall, the game is good. I just can‚Äôt see anything when up in the sky or any of the water either which is an issue to be fixed. Thank you for making the game again! I hope this review helps!",3
So i was going on to one of the temples where you can use Lisa as a fighting character. And I was trying to fight the red flame blobs. I tried plenty of times but failed because I have to do it under twenty seconds which is insane. I always wanted to try this game and it started off fun then boring and to hard. Also I don‚Äôt know if the loading screen when you sign up is based on the internet to make it faster. But it took to long. It took me most of my day for it to load which is INSANE. This is a fun game but it kinda starts to get boring. Also while I was on a quest it was rlly hard to find where I was supposed to go. And I was wondering where paimon was because it felt like she just disappeared. I could here her voice but I couldn‚Äôt see her. It rlly was a fun game at the start but it‚Äôs to hard to move on.,3
"I love this game, but I‚Äôm probably going to uninstall. I keep getting stuck because the combat (which I don‚Äôt much enjoy in the first place) is too hard with the basic characters and the gatcha system mostly gives you the same character over and over and dozens of low-level weapons. If I want to progress, I‚Äôm going to have to spend hundreds of dollars for a tiny chance at a good character. I‚Äôm what they call a casual gamer. I want to explore and do quests and maybe do a little bit of battle here and there. This game is gorgeous and the world is amazing and I wish I could spend longer in it. But I‚Äôd rather pay $60 up front for a complete game than download a game for ‚Äúfree‚Äù that is impossible to finish. Also it takes up SO much space on my mobile phone, and kills my (brand new) battery.",3
"Summary: 
I‚Äôm a semi-old player who will highly recommend this game but watch out for primogems, they can dominate your experience sometimes. Also the storage is a lie. 
‚Äî
As somebody who‚Äôs been a player since the original Venti banner, I‚Äôm addicted to this game hands down. It‚Äôs a unique and creative rpg game with a immersive world which really grips you into the game even more than it already would have with the characters, voice acting, story, scenery, fanbase, events, etc... .

 I can‚Äôt help but feel like a lot of the gameplay revolves around finding primogems at the point where I get excited to get even 2 from a chest after scavenging for an hour. I understand primogems are an important part of the game especially when it comes to getting characters you want, my friends who don‚Äôt spend money on this game complain all the time about how they feel pressured into investing money into the game when they clearly don‚Äôt want to. 

If you‚Äôre considering downloading this game watch out for primogems, don‚Äôt let them take over your experience with the game.  (also the game takes up *way* more storage than it says it does, it claims like 3GB but it‚Äôs really like 11GB)",4
"I‚Äôm not too good with words just read other reviews for issues. This game has got a chokehold on me, I love it i really do. That‚Äôs why I want  to be executed well and received decently (someone will always hate it) So the Sumerian characters being more pale than my Caucasian mother was a surprise and uhh. The concepts were cute and so were the designs but in the context that we had been waiting for dark skinned and poc rep in sumeru was disappointing when only one was noticeably dark. Even then she was pretty pale. I wish there were one or three more dark characters and we have yet for a black character ( with the hair as well) and the hourglass shape on every girl is disappointing. It started out amazing and just nosedived. I want it to get better",5
"i have been playing since 1.2 and i have never been this upset about what hoyoverse is doing with their game. the main issue i have with this game is that there is barley any representation. i understand that the first two regions that released were mainly centered around/inspired by East Asia, but there is no excuse for making most of the playable characters/NPCS pale skinned in a region that is based off of Middle East and North Africa (Sumeru). It‚Äôs disappointing how the new characters are even paler than MONSTADT characters (which is based off Germany..) Listen to your fanbase when we tell you GIVE US MORE REPRESENTATION. We currently only have two characters that are dark skinned (tan at most at this point) and they are only four stars. Y‚Äôall must be scared of losing profits. Anyways I will not be spending money or playing this game anymore until y‚Äôall add more darker skinned characters because right now y‚Äôall have 50 shades of the same white color on 45 of your characters, pls do better.",1
So I‚Äôm not really happy that almost all your characters are pale skinned and I know that there is pale poc but honestly you need to make more brown and black characters cause we need representation. Another thing that I know is that you made Liyue based off of china and you also made inazuma based of Japan and also mondstadt off of Germany and almost all the characters in those places are pale skinned. So if you make people in sumeru so pale and add no brown or black people that is not representation of brown people and black people and also the npc‚Äôs should be brown and black people in there. if the dendro archon look like Klee but with ears I think y‚Äôall need to work on it a little longer then and no I‚Äôm not no game developer and I don‚Äôt know how y‚Äôall do it but I know that it‚Äôs not that hard to put brown or black characters and if y‚Äôall can‚Äôt do that‚Äôs really sad. So I‚Äôm just going to say this all I want is brown and black representation and that‚Äôs all we need.,1
"Genshin was amazing in the beginning I feel because it was something new to the mobile experience, and was similar to BoTW. It began as a great open-world game and was fun to explore until the exploration ends. Like sure, they are adding more content and you could get your exploration to 100%, but it‚Äôs pure desperation at that point. All you have left to do after completing the mediocre story and boring side quests is to grind endlessly for artifacts and materials for your character to become stronger‚Ä¶ and for what? The content doesn‚Äôt get any more challenging once you‚Äôre at a good point with a few characters which does take a while, but not long enough, because you‚Äôll eventually catch up with the content eventually. 
As a former whale, I definitely ask that you proceed with caution when you want to spend on this game because in the end, it just isn‚Äôt worth it. It feels like there‚Äôs no love put into this game at all.",1
"I love this game it‚Äôs very cool but..
The full version takes to many GB , but I still think the game is good I have the full version but it took until 10:46 , I had to restart my whole iPad and my phone just to download the full version it only took an minute that‚Äôs why I love it it only takes a little minutes so I think you all should download the app but delete all of your apps , if you want the apps you already have you can like restall the app delete it and then download the app after your done downloading genshin after pls make sure to make an picture if you forget and if you have a lot of photos delete them all and if you want some just keep them or take an picture of it so..!<3",5
"overall, i absolutely adore this game. while i do have some frustrations‚Ä¶mainly regarding the absence of playable characters in your world (how fun would it be to be able to chat with klee or thoma everyday?!!) and also the slightly disappointing end to the inazuma archon quest (it‚Äôs not bad by any means, it just wasn‚Äôt entirely on par with the liyue quest‚Ä¶..), i couldn‚Äôt honestly give this game anywhere below a 5 star rating. i‚Äôve totally fallen in love with it, spending countless hours playing. not only is the story pretty fantastic, but the game itself is really beautiful and quite often i find myself running around like an idiot (still perfectly entertained). there is so much to do and so many characters to meet and fall in love with‚Ä¶the vast majority of them have touching backstories and are truly a joy to interact with (my favorite has got to be kazuha). 
i may be slightly biased, as this game is one of few things that got me through one of the more difficult periods of my life, but i will say this: to anyone questioning whether to get this game or not, i absolutely recommend. give it a try, and maybe you‚Äôll fall in love with it as i have!!",5
"Honestly, I wanted to like this game. My friends talked about it a lot and seemed really into it. They described it as a Breath of the Wild meets Waifu gacha and, as someone into gacha games and BotW, I was interested. But I played about ten minutes and was immediately bored of the gameplay. It felt like there was simultaneously too much and too little to do. Overwhelming in visuals yet underwhelming in actual substance. A stunning world that just felt so empty. 

The constellation/upgrade system didn‚Äôt make any sense, the controls were finicky (archery is impossible), running the game tanked my battery, and, like I said, the world ‚Äî while beautiful ‚Äî was just boring. Playing on PlayStation didn‚Äôt make it any better. I get more entertainment scrolling my Twitter for fanart than I do playing the actual game. It‚Äôs a pretty package with nothing filling it. And that‚Äôs not even mentioning the questionable practices of the dev company. Save yourself time and money and just search the Twitter tag for pretty fanart.",1
"I loved this game from day one, it never really gets boring because of the new content that I look forward to! I always recommend this game to everyone I know, and so far, everyone loves it! Co-op is fun because it always bring me and my friends joy. The open-world is so much fun to explore and brings me joy when there is a new region available. Even once you‚Äôre out of resin, you can always find something else to do with friends or just by yourself. This game sits in a special part of my heart as it has brought me happiness and newly formed friends. I hope this game continues running in the future and eventually comes to an end with a storyline that gets your blood pumping! Happy 1st Anniversary, Genshin Impact!",5
"The app is really addicting and I love it but theres problems ruining my experience. The game can crash sometimes I would have to turn off my phone, Freezes randomly when I click on the menu button and talk to a certain character, It also lags even when I put the graphic on low. Great game I really support the it theres nothing wrong with my phone by the way, I just want this fixed. Also if I wanted to delete my account ( which I‚Äôm not gonna do) the website should have a form to delete a mihoyo account. Lets say if i had a old account somebody might hack and take my info. I need to delete my account before other strangers have access to it. SO PLEASE ADD THE ACCOUNT DELETION FORM ON THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE!",5
"The new housing system is beautiful but there are some problems that I hope could possibly be fixed in the next update (and ive seen other people complain about this too). 

Many players have reached the maximum ‚Äúload value‚Äù for their house. The game only allows users to place 40 items sometimes even 30 and then we can‚Äôt put anything anymore when our houses are not even 1/4 done... please fix this.. i think the housing system would be a LOT better if the items we could place weren‚Äôt so restricted. Minecraft allows us to put as much as we want so i really think genshin should do the same as it would be more fun and would let us have more creativity.",5
"I stopped gaming a few years back because I couldn't find any games that could grab my attention like they did when I was younger. The last time I played a game this much was back in 2013, when FreeRealms was still a thing. My boyfriend introduced me to this game back in February and I have absolutely fallen in love with everything about it. Sure, the dailies might be a little repetitive, but that just might be the only complaint I really have. I've put so much of my time and money into this game and haven't regretted it for a second. The characters and their abilities are amazing, the stories are amazing, and the art is incredible. I'm so excited for all the new content to come!! Would absolutely recommend this game :)",5
"This game is one of my favorites because of the great graphics and the variety of things to do. My main problem with this game is the extremely low rates of getting anything, not to mention how expensive it is to farm domains and bosses.  I mean, I get it‚Äôs necessary for companies to make money but they could up the rate so that it doesn‚Äôt take 90 wishes to get a five star character or item. Also what happens when you get C6 on a character but keep getting their constellations, there should be something that allows one to exchange constellations for another character or something... because they are just wasted primogems that sit around in your inventory. Other than that, great game and I can‚Äôt wait to see the other areas!",5
"I was very impressed by this app! It is extremely fun yet gives a challenge to people. All the characters are unique. It also takes a lot of combos and power-up which makes this game even more in depth. This would have been 5 stars except for the character policy. So you get 6 free characters and the rest are earned by spending primo gems (special currency) that they give you for little things such as opening chests and completing quests. However NONE ( except for the 6 free characters) of the the characters are guaranteed. In fact I spent 20 dollars to get one character and I still didn‚Äôt get him. And it‚Äôs not really worth spending 20 bucks on reruns or characters that you‚Äôll never use. Even though they do have a pity system, it takes 100 wishes (which is really expensive) to come into effect for a 5 star character.",3
"I love this game and the lagging/ technical issues don't really bother me like some people. It deserves 5 stars really but I only gave it 4 because the excessive downloading and updates. Every time I get on, there's new content to download. It's great they constantly work on the game and try to improve it but when I can't play it anywhere but my home because it drains all my data downloading half the internet and won't let me play without it, it gets annoying af. I can't stand games that force new gigantic updates instantaneously with no way to play otherwise. Some people don't have the memory or the data and are completely deterred from playing all together when that becomes a CONSTANT issue. I've heard it's better on the pc so maybe the mobile app just isn't for me.",4
"this game is really beautiful and really fun. there are so much good and hard work that is put in. i came through some troubles where pulling characters were really unfair. all of us players work really hard to earn all these materials to pull wishes but it is really really hard to get what we want that is simple. i saw that there were players that got so much amazing things but there are also people that can't even get anything so simple. so mainly, maybe something that can be fix is fairness or as in having the receive rate actually even. the results of the 4 star characrter rates were not balanced. also one more thing, using primogems to buy wishes is kind of expensive since we don't earn so much fast without the money. if these were fixed, I would definitely play way more often.",4
I absolutely love this game for its music graphics and for its really fun gameplay but the only reason I do unfortunately have to dock some points is of course the Gacha now I‚Äôm aware that this game isn‚Äôt pay 2 win since I‚Äôm a F2P and I‚Äôve still gotten two 5 stars in my first 2 months of playing the game however I do understand why some people really dislike the gacha since it can be pretty annoying to either A. Grind the primogems for so long for some really bad rolls or B. Taking too long or too much for pity only suggestion I would have is to lower the pity a bit so more F2P get the 5 stars they want and people who do spend money can get their characters maxed out quicker. Anyways keep out the great work very excited for the next updates,5
"-1 star for having one of the worst gacha systems I‚Äôve ever seen in any mobile game - on par with FGO and DX2 in terms of pure greed - in a game that‚Äôs probably meant to compete with console titles (otherwise why else would they give it crossplay and market it towards a non-gacha audience?) and doesn‚Äôt need to be anywhere near as stingy as it is. Cut the greed out.
Other than that, the game is quite interesting - a major open-world 3D game that can be played on-the-go - that manages to add dignity to the mobile gaming market, which is mostly filled with garbage apps that are clearly meant to pander to casuals with large wallets and minimal scruples. If companies won‚Äôt make high quality games like this of their own volition, then consumers need to vote with their wallets and make it happen - Genshin Impact should be the start of a new rule, rather than just a footnote.",4
"Aside from the gacha system for characters it‚Äôs a good game and I hope it gets better with more content and story. 

Despite the backlash of it being a ‚ÄúBOTW‚Äù ripoff it really isn‚Äôt. There are aspects of BOTW in the game like climbing, gliding, graphics, etc. However the story and gameplay is different. So to the people who dislike it for being a clone, play first.

Overall I am very happy about this game. The need to use money is optional and the game gives you a decent lineup of characters at the start to handle every encounter. My only hope for the gacha system is the occasional gift or event for players to use it from time to time.

I would highly recommend this game to my friends and I can‚Äôt wait to play more.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Current minor bug that‚Äôs bothering me comes from the voice dialogue. 
Is it just me or does the game start treating you like the twin brother? 
I mean, I chose to play as the twin sister, but suddenly the voice dialogue ie Paimon said I was looking for my sister aka me, instead of my brother. 
I mean I don‚Äôt mind it much, but hearing the characters refer to me as a ‚Äúhe‚Äù and my twin as a ‚Äúsister‚Äù when the text says otherwise puts me off and kills the immersion.",5
"I downloaded the game today and have been playing ALL DAY LONG. I honestly love these types of games and can never get enough. When they said open world, they really meant it. I spent hours simply just exploring and grinding. I usually hate to grind but this game changes each monster battle every time. I love the flying aspect of the game as well. 
Some issues I noticed: sometimes the character's feet will glitch through the ground, also the voiceover sometimes does not match what it says in the text. 
They're not huge issues but can take someone out of the fantasy of the game.
Also got some cool loot early on thanks to the developers and their freebies. sadly, i am still a student so i have other responsibilities to attend to, but I can't wait to keep playing again tomorrow",5
"I love this game. I really do. It‚Äôs fun and There‚Äôs tons of things you can do to entertain you. But one thing I think can be more useful is to have an option to un- level characters or really reset them. Over time from wishing I‚Äôve gotten characters that has proven to make me stronger, but I have other characters that have been leveled up so much all the resources are wasted. And over time as you level up, getting materials becomes very difficult which makes it harder to get stronger and personally enjoy the game overall. I think being able to un- level characters for a certain price can make it easier for new players who don‚Äôt have the grasp of the game just yet still be able to enjoy Genshin.  I hope this idea is considered eventually",4
"The story is good and all but the character skills are terrible.  Almost all the skills of new characters are copy paste from an existing one.  With the last character they added, they tried something new and created the most dysfunctional kit I've ever seen.  This character was shown in their stream saying that it worked for some reactions, when in reality it didn't.  She doesn't even work for what they said on their own stream!  She is a 5 star (more expensive) that does not even compete with 4 stars.  And above all this, the company does absolutely nothing even when everyone is on social media asking for a fix, not even an announcement.  This company does not listen to its players at all unless they are a threat for them.  And this is just using one character as an example, there are more cases like this and they have NOT done anything, just ignoring their playerbase.",2
"Dehya has so many glaring problems with her kit in terms of gameplay and numbers. And instead of fixing those issues, Hoyoverse would rather make her a standard character and move on as if that validates their decision. Very scummy and unfair to all the players who‚Äôve been looking forward to this character. If they do this to Dehya, they‚Äôll do it to more future characters as well. 

Please buff Dehya. It doesn‚Äôt even take that much effort. Either rework her kit so she‚Äôll actually have a role somewhere or simply give her better numbers. Who cares if she ends up being OP? It‚Äôs a casual PVE game, not a competitive PVP one. The characters that we spend money for SHOULD at the very least be good. How can a multi million dollar company come up with something this bad? It‚Äôs almost like you hate money, you hate the people who play your game, you hate your own game and characters and just want some of them to be trash for no reason. 

Please buff Dehya and fix her.",1
"I love this game a lot! I play it almost everyday and the graphics are so good for a free game, however I do have some issues when playing.
1) whenever I redeem codes, sometimes I won‚Äôt be able to claim them from the mail, yes, when I do redeem the codes it says ‚Äúsuccessfully redeemed!‚Äù Or something like that but I‚Äôm never able to redeem it
2) It kicks me out often, I don‚Äôt know if this is a game problem or my phone software; apologies if it is just a software issue
3) I feel like the pity system should be lowered for F2P players so we don‚Äôt have to spend money, I do believe that the pity system is just ‚Äúluck‚Äù in a way, but it‚Äôd be nice if that was lowered.
Those are the only issues I have but I definitely recommend for people who need something to do!",4
"Okay, I love this game so much and i highly suggest trying it out! But the amount of storage this game tales up is Insane, I almost don't have enough storage left to get any other apps on my phone anymore, I don't know if there's something that Hoyoverse can do about it but if you can please try to lessen the storage it takes up because I would love to keep playing this game but with every update I need to go and delete almost everything on my phone to have enough space. But besides that I think this game is lovely and so beautiful to play and look at, also another thing? I don't really like the way traveler hardly speaks, they only speak when there's something very important happening otherwise it's just paimon speaking for us. Thank youuu that's all there is",4
"I love this game so much. The art is great, the characters are cute, cool, pretty, and strong at the same time, the storyline and adventure is great and I have participated in almost all events that have come up in the time I have played this game. but the one thing I don‚Äôt like is how you can‚Äôt enter your serenity pot or do some quests without finishing other quests, I get it is supposed to push/make you do those other quests but a lot of the ones I have to do to unlock/do other quests and enter my serenity pot has either something in the way or are so complicated that I can‚Äôt finish them (believe me I don‚Äôt just not do or finish quests because I don‚Äôt feel like it. I get it done even if I think it‚Äôs boring)",5
"I have played many games and have never found one that has added so many of my favorite elements in one! Genshin has taken the best of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the wild and incorporated it into their gameplay, and that alone has alot to say considering Breath of the wild is one of the best games with many games copying its top tier model! Genshin Impact uses these concepts and created a beautiful Open World (Free Roam) and also added a wonderful cast of Characters that you could play, which is one of my favorite additions! I enjoy that each has a story and set of abilities to go with them! If you have not tried Genshin or Breath of the wild, and are not used to that gameplay, or even if you are‚Ä¶. I highly recommend you try this game!",5
"Genshin is a great game overall. But when it comes to representation and skin diversity they lack. With the new Sumeru coming was quite excited to see characters who may look more like me since the area it is based off is one of my families countries. I know this is just the 1st run of characters but it makes me very sad and slightly upset that for an area that‚Äôs supposed to be based of off my culture and people, it‚Äôs full of people who look nothing like they‚Äôre form their and they are all pale with Eurocentric features. I am glad at leas the NPC‚Äôs are closer to what people actually look like but it would be amazing if actual playable characters could be similar in features and skin tones. I hope to se s‚Äômore diverse characters in theFuture especially since the next few areas other than Fontaine are based on countries with tanned or darker skin folk üòäplease understand where I‚Äôm coming from and I hope this issue may be changed soon.",1
"The game, amazing beautiful and great: Problems: Loading, it‚Äôs really laggy: Also, there is way too much simps for female and male characters it kinda gets out of hand. Also i wish that primogem (Gacha material) would be easier besides doing commissions every. single. day. Same with content creators they do get bored out of genshin and also they spend a lot of money on the game. Be careful with your wallets in this game. But My great experience with the game: Co-op! It‚Äôs really great and helps alot if you need to get materials easier also you can play this on pc and PS4 and (PS5 too.) You can get free characters from story quests and also the lore is really cool and interesting. Definitely recommend for BOW players (breath of the wild) Players!",5
"I don‚Äôt have this game on iPhone but on PS and I gotta say this is one of my favorite games to play during my free time. The music in the game is amazing including the battle music, the characters in the game are really fun to play with, and the story is really good. Their is no ending but their are character story‚Äôs and hangouts which are very fun. You do got to grind a lot and work on a good team but it‚Äôs still worth the grind no matter what.

One of my favorite characters is Xiao which is one of the good characters to play as and he does this dash attack that does a lot of damage depending on the artifacts u put on him. The artifacts can be annoying to get bc almost all the time u get crap but still it‚Äôs worth the grind.

My main team I run and had since the I got the game is Xiao, Bennett, Fischl and Zhongli. I run this team so Bennett can buff my characters which is his special attack and it can also heal my team, Zhongli‚Äôs amazing shield and his special attack, Fischl‚Äôs bird named Oz and Xiao‚Äôs special attack his dash.

I really love this game and it really helped me when I had nothing to do on PS and I recommend u should get it too and it‚Äôs free on IPhone, PS, PC, etc.",5
"I play on my iPad and it tends to crash a lot, especially when on co-op. Also I‚Äôve never gotten a 5 star weapon or character, but those are my only complaints. The graphics, the storyline, the gameplay, the monsters, the skills, etc. are just so good that I don‚Äôt even care that it crashes so often. It just makes co-op hard which I‚Äôd disappointing but it‚Äôs whatever. My friend got me to download it and now my sister has it too and so does another of my friends üòÇ It‚Äôs honestly kind of addicting too which may not be good but it‚Äôs a very enjoyable game. Would definitely recommend. Oh yeah, I‚Äôm also sad that you can‚Äôt kill the dogs or cats.

(Update: I haven‚Äôt been able to play in over a week now because it crashes immediately after I log in every time. Im very disappointed. WHY DOES IT CRASH SO MUCH?!!?!)",4
"It‚Äôs completely unacceptable what they‚Äôve done to Yae Miko. They have actually scammed people by essentially nullifying the effects of her second constellation. I‚Äôm f2p so I have her at c0 but I still spent hard earned primogems and precious resources to level her up. Only for this shady company to completely nerf her in the next patch under the guise of a bug fix. I have a hard time believing they made this ‚Äúfix‚Äù thinking that it actually made her a better character. In every situation, it‚Äôs a nerf. They made people pay money to get this character to higher constellations and then nullified the effects of a constellation that people paid for. Even disregarding the c2 issue, this change made her a much worse character overall. 

I really hope they at least revert her to how she was pre 2.6 patch. It‚Äôs unbelievable that they even thought this was a remotely good idea. Stop trying to scam your loyal player base, be a better company.",1
"This game is such an amazing, fun, interesting game. My cousin recommended me the game around September/November 2020, especially my friend who recommended me on june 2021, so I decided to download it since I‚Äôve seen many people playing it, and I cant tell you how much this game is amazing, the graphics are very good, the story is interesting, and everything‚Äôs perfect! I‚Äôd recommend people that like combat games, interesting stories, anime characters, etc. Genshin impact is much more better then honkai impact in my opinion, you can equip multiple characters if their in your party, the events are so exciting. You make wishes to earn characters from event banners, standard, beginners, and weapon. There‚Äôs even test run to try the characters. This game just saved me from boredom",5
"I genuinely genshin so much. Co-op experiences are ALWAYS a blast! The characters and overall game is REALLY well designed and detailed. My only concern (more like a request) is to have little side quests that you can always do once you reach AR49 - AR50 because things do start getting boring the closer you get to technically finishing the game. The voice actors of Genshin are all really nice and funny to watch! (On YT, Twitch and/or on Tiktok) i CANT WAIT for the new Inazuma update... and especially for ayaka. Genshin Impact is such a fun game to play especially with other people/friends! I just HOPEEEE that more characters can get buffed because it‚Äôs coming to the point to were I can‚Äôt even get 2 stars in a abys, even with fully leveled characters üíî. Hopefully some of you can sympathize with me..",5
"Genshin Impact is probably the most fun I‚Äôve had playing a mobile game in years. It‚Äôs graphics, world design, battle system, and characters are all amazing and unique. My only gripes with it are: When I‚Äôm just opening up the app, it takes at least a minute to load (load meaning where you see the MIHOYO screen, then GENSHIN IMPACT), and that whenever I switch my party around, without fail, I know my game will crash. I don‚Äôt know why it does this, I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a bug. I‚Äôm hoping it will get fixed soon, but I love this game and want to watch it grow.
**EDIT:** As much as I love Genshin Impact, it‚Äôs becoming downright unplayable on a mobile device. Whenever I try to do a commission/quest, I‚Äôll get about 3 dialogue lines in, then the game just crashes. This is with every quest, so I physically CANNOT progress in the game. PLEASE do what you can to fix this",4
"I absolutely love this game. I‚Äôm currently AR 41 and have still yet to run out of things to do. I typically play on PC more often but when I‚Äôm out of the house and have time I like to play on mobile as well. 

I was reading through some reviews while the latest version updates on my phone and I realized a lot of people compare this game to Zelda BOTW which I can understand to a point. But Genshin Impact is so unique in its own ways. I personally love BOTW as well but Genshin Impact is constantly evolving and making this game absolutely amazing. 

I also noticed many people upset over the summoning system to get new characters and such. Must be their first gacha game lol. That‚Äôs typically how these kind of games work. It takes a lot of patience. If you take the time and do all the quests and find as many chests as possible, you‚Äôll easily be able to have enough gems to get yourself a 5 star character or more. It is absolutely not a pay to play game. On the contrary if you are interested in paying to play it most definitely speeds up the process.

With all that being said, I adore this game. I am so happy I get to play this game as it continues to grow and expand. Keep up the great work Mihoyo!",5
"I love the game, great qualities, lore, the character designs, scenery and overall everything, but. There has been an issue lately, Candance, (please forgive me if I spelled it wrong) is a character that‚Äôs supposed to represent Kandake(s)? All Kandake have dark skin, but Candace doesn‚Äôt have that, instead it mores of like a brownish mixed with white? Not sure how to explain it. I love the game, and the characters are great, but me and also lots of people who play really want somebody who‚Äôs black. Not like candace‚Äôs, Kaeya‚Äôs and others skin color. Considering how this was the only game I‚Äôve ever played in a while it‚Äôs pretty disappointing. Looking forward to see other characters, that hopefully represent more people correctly (not trying to be rude haha) but thank you for making this wonderful game!",4
"Were donu start this is officially THE BEST game ive 100% ever played in my life the game is just so increadibly just out of this world it is literally just such an awsome game and even when you think that theres nothing left to do yiu just have so muchhh with a humongous map to explore, with such an amazing story, with the chest to unlock, and the characters that everyone wants its just like a never ending game and j feel like i would be playing this game for at least a year bcs the game is just that good but there is just one thing that i cant get over.... that the game is not on xbox one that made me sad that it works like that, and also that you cant go from playing in the ps4 to olaying on the phone like why??? U cant transfer an account but with that aside this is the best game to play",5
"Honestly this game is fantastically amazing, thrilling, and full of wonder. Here by far one thing I seem to notice that caught my eyes in this game is the fact, u can only interact with one animal and...that‚Äôs the dog name strong.
Now I personally think and so do other people too....
This game is full with potential to come by how it already looks there is no doubt this game is a successor, really gives of a different vibe and controls to the game, finding stuff , actually having to read what the NPC say, to get to point A and point B.

Time to get to the point of why I wrote a Review of this game Pets! without a doubt the game should have pets.. following every where u go... like that one dog at washi inn (the big tree with the broken stairs inn don‚Äôt really know the name) that follows you inside or outside the inn..
Pets would honestly be nice in the game and having to feed them when they attack the monsters for u and there health goes down.
Also should affects for the Pets: commands,
:skill sets (kinda like a bond skill thing between u and ur pets the stronger the bond the powerful the pet is and your pets charters pets commands are) and this why I think pets should be in the game 

HAVE A GREAT DAY",5
i‚Äôve been playing this game for well over a year it‚Äôs great it‚Äôs a open-world MMO and has a gacha system but you don‚Äôt have to get into that i still wish they would fix a few things like the standard banner and to add things to not make the game stale like a infinite spiral abyss but it‚Äôs just has good graphics and is just fun to play as a new player but the veteran players know what i mean when i say it gets stale when they give out minimal events and story quests and they also some characters power-creep other characters which is sometimes annoying when u get like a diluc or a klee then say hu tao out powers them i know that how they make money but it‚Äôs still annoying that‚Äôs what i think about it .,4
"Most of the game is fun for a low ar and the story line is great! The only hing I'm going to complain about is the people/fandom. The fandom doesn‚Äôt affect the game it‚Äôs just when you play it and join a co-op some people just judge who you‚Äôre using for the domain/boss. They judge the level, say ‚ÄúChange them.‚Äù And stuff but honestly I just leave if they don‚Äôt like it üë®‚Äçüíª. I just actually got Ganyu + Amo‚Äôs Bow. I started last January (the 18th), and I‚Äôve lost many accounts due to not adding my email and forgetting my password. But I‚Äôve got Hu Tao also. Most character have amazing backstories and great outfits. Genshin Impact has made me really happy though my sister tells me I‚Äôm Obsessed, I don‚Äôt care, LOL. Anyways, Genshin Impact is very fun! Until you die of course, but exploring Inazuma and new places is so fun! Overall 4/5 *",4
"I got a new iPad hoping I can play Genshin impact with a bigger screen, also because I didn‚Äôt have enough space on my iPhone to download Genshin impact. When I got Genshin impact on the iPad I was so excited to have a bigger version of my phone to play on and to see the beautiful scenery. Unfortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case. When I started playing on my iPad I had terrible lag in the background graphics and nothing was rendering correctly. For example I had to get close to the building or tree in order for it to not be blurry or just a solid color. I hope that genshin is able to fix this problem so I can play on my iPad without being frustrated that the graphics are bad.",5
I‚Äôve been playing this game since it came out but let me tell you how much gigabytes does takes up holy moly every time it updates well ever since it started updating I‚Äôve been having problems. Like I get it but at the same time I‚Äôm struggling to keep playing it because of the amount of space it takes up. My iPad only takes up 64 GB and right now I‚Äôm at 61 literally struggling and crying RIP. I could probably get more gigabytes but that‚Äôs more money. Ugh if it comes any worse I literally might have to delete the game even though I‚Äôve been playing it for so long and have literally completed everything but it‚Äôs still fun could recommend it‚Äôs just a struggle if you have no space.,5
Look I love the game and all but like I was waiting to do co op mode because my friends are a way higher level then me while I am on adventure rank 25 the only problem is about co op is that you have to unlock the secret of tianqu valley and it‚Äôs so annoying because half of the people still can‚Äôt do co op and another thing primogen is way to high but your prob not gonna read this cause I guess that‚Äôs the point of money if you read this and fix these issues I would really appreciate it edit: I know they are giving us mail and all but at least can u please read the comments because you do need a upgrade just saying and be sure  to read comments before u download but in any case I would recommend this to other people surely,4
"This game is awesome. The graphics are incredible in every aspect of the game. It‚Äôs somewhat hard to understand at first but game play is pretty easy. 
 It‚Äôs nice that when you wish for a character if you get multiple of the same character you get constellations for said character which unlocks better abilities. 
However, it‚Äôs annoying on event banners that you can still continue to get that same character after you‚Äôve received all the constellations which I think is pretty crappy. There should be a cap on getting a character once you‚Äôve received all of its constellations so you can receive constellations for different characters. I understand it‚Äôs a gatcha game but still. Reward your players better especially the ones that put money into the game.",4
"venti needs another story quest. as the anemo archon and best character in the game, he deserves one. as an ar 45 venti lover, i have completed every quest that includes venti and i miss him so much. i go to mondstat often, but i never get to see venti, just his statue and its not the same. i don't have venti, and this is why i want him. i love him so much. this is why i refuse to delete any of my venti photos. he's amazing and i love him. venti NEEDS another story quest as the anemo archon. his stort quest was fun and i did enjoy it, but as an archon he should get another one. zhongli has two, venti should have two. i think its fair. i love him and need to see him again and all of his glory. i bettet see another venti story quest by the and of 2022, or i will throw a fit. thank you.",5
"I really like Genshin Impact, I‚Äôve had it since preorder. I‚Äôve stuck with for a long time and my friend picked it up as well. The music and the world layout is stunning. The only problem I have with this game is the rates for summons. Right now, I have failed pity with Xiao and gotten Jean, didn‚Äôt get Albedo, both Venti banners, and I am at 67 summons on the Tartaglia banner. I have 15 days to get to pity which is basically impossibe since I‚Äôm free to play. My friend I mentioned earlier however has gotten way better luck than me. He‚Äôs pulled Diluc, Wolf‚Äôs Gravestone, Hutao 20 summons later, and a skyward sword(possibly some others) while I really haven‚Äôt had the best of luck in the same amount of time. I just wish that the odds for everyone were truly the same and this didn‚Äôt happen as often.",4
"The world is lush and colorful with a serene sound track. However, outside of that the combat is monotonous. The only thing to do is farm material drops once a day until minions respawn. Any other ways to progress your team are locked behind pay/time gates or gacha systems. The way they progress the story is about as exciting as watching paint dry. It‚Äôs a lot and I mean A LOT of reading while the camera pans or jumps around to try and keep you engaged. On top of all of that the developers do not communicate with the community. They rarely fix any bugs/broken characters and spend all their time making newer stronger characters to sell you. For which the odds of receiving any 5 star is 1% or lower that is including a guaranteed pull for a 5 star after 90 pulls. So the odds are actually far worse than that. 

TLDR; don‚Äôt waste your time here you will only end up frustrated and with less money than when you started.",1
"Many games I‚Äôve played before this one at the start allowed people to play and enjoy the time put into it without feeling like you have to put money into it to get the fullest experience 
 Only to soon make it next to impossible to get enjoyment without feeling like you have to pay once in awhile 
 But in genshin you never have to pay anything and your never locked out of things. There‚Äôs a character you want and didn‚Äôt get them they will come back and you can try again or there will be a plethora of others you can get and you don‚Äôt have to spend a dime. Sure it may take longer but it‚Äôs possible to get what you want with just the resources in game and I appreciate that.",5
"Amazing Amazing game I have been playing it since it first launched and I plan on playing for much longer. It‚Äôs a free game when other games (like Zelda) that have a similar gameplay cost $50ish. I will always thrive about this game and the characters and designs and gameplay. However, it does sometimes seem like the makers of the game take advantage of the fanbase and don‚Äôt give all they could to show the gratitude to people who have made this game as popular as it is by playing it since the beginning and bringing friends to play it. The anniversary award was a joke and getting characters and weapons seems to be a lot harder than usual. Would like them to maybe respect us as people like they did in the beginning.",5
"The gacha system is really unforgiving. 90 wishes for a guaranteed character and then you have to win that 50/50 chance of getting the character on the banner or not. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair at all and it‚Äôs a total cash grab but that‚Äôs only if you care about getting 5* characters. (I personally spent way too much. Don‚Äôt get sucked in.) Otherwise the game is pretty fun. There‚Äôs plenty of quests to do and it has a very interesting storyline. It does make my phone hot. Before I upgraded, my iPhone 7 was basically overheating and it made my game lag. Now that I have the 10 it‚Äôs much better. Oh and lastly yes it is similar to breath of the wild however since I‚Äôve played both I can tell you that they give off a completely different vibe. Both games are amazing and even though they have a few similarities playing them is completely different. Don‚Äôt listen to people who say it‚Äôs a rip off botw lol. (Yo fix the anniversary rewards)",1
"They really hit it out of the park with its breath taking clips, story, and scenery. The voice actors did an amazing job and the characters look spectacular. I‚Äôve been playing ever since the beginning of the month when it was first launched and have never gotten bored of it. Every single update release also have something both interesting and amazing especially the new events, areas, bosses, and just all round new content (Don‚Äôt forget the new characters too those are important). Genshin is also better than most open world games out there because the story ark doesn‚Äôt get boring nor is it overwhelming, it‚Äôs just the right amount to satisfy the community as this is just the beginning.",5
"For the first 15-20 hours of playing this game, I had an amazing time with it. The gacha rates were predatory, sure, but I was able to have fun with what little the game gave me and made it through the main story loving every part of it. As you begin to get to the end however, there is nothing left to do. Chests do not come back, so there‚Äôs no point reexploring the world. Resin recharge is too slow, so obtaining items to level up characters or getting good artifacts is mostly just a case of waiting for your resin to come back. The new events really don‚Äôt fix anything. They‚Äôre too short, offer too little rewards, and don‚Äôt add any good repeatable content to the game.

So overall, I wouldn‚Äôt bother with this game. It‚Äôs fun for a while, but there‚Äôs nothing to do anymore other than wait for more updates that continue the main story. Overall, this game felt very disappointing after the initial honeymoon phase. Save your time and look elsewhere.",1
"Overall the story is nice the characters are good the game runs very smooth. Though playing this game does drain your battery extremely quickly. Sometimes the fighting can get extremely annoying, for instance when there is a mob on top of a mountain, if they fall or you push them off instead of dying most of the time they just respawn with full health. Which is extremely annoying if you‚Äôve spent the past 5 minutes taking down their health. Another problem is if you push them too far from their spawn they start walking back and then immediately regain full health even if you follow them and attack. This is extremely infuriating especially when you just pull them from dodging or via their own attacks. You don‚Äôt have to be far AT ALL in order for this to trigger.",4
Gentian impact is so cool because you can earn more characters by wishes but we‚Äôre just gonna also be frustrating because they you canGet a sword that you already have and you use all of your wishes up that happened to me but if you get the tan one and it turns purple you can it can be possible that you could get a character or just a bunch of sorts that you already have that can be frustrating and you can also go on full cool adventures and our new items you can get health food to heal your characters and there‚Äôs a character her name is Fishel and she has a bunch of cool sheep sheep bone arrows and you can turn into a bird and I hope you can get this game too because to me this game is so funüçáüçìüçâüçíüçãüççü•ùüçëüåàüí´‚≠êÔ∏èüåü‚ú®üå∏üåºüåªüåπü•Äüå∫üåæüíêüå∑üçÑüêöü™®üçÉüçÇüçÅüéçü™¥üéãüåø‚òòÔ∏èüçÄüåøüå¥ü™µüå±üéÑüå≤üå≥üåµü¶îüêÅüïäü¶©üêáüêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶ôüê©ü¶öü¶Æüêà‚Äç‚¨õü¶åüêé By Olivia Louise Luque,5
"However, it takes up too much space. I already deleted five different apps and it still isn‚Äôt enough storage. I love and hate the game at the same time because it has great gameplay and great characters, but it also infuriates me to the point of rage quitting. It is open area and it‚Äôs nice to explore the places. I‚Äôve uninstalled this game more than once out of rage, and I‚Äôm too busy and poor to buy or to keep up with the wish events for certain characters. If you can that‚Äôs great, but for those who can‚Äôt; know that there are ways to gain stuff without buying so you‚Äôre good in that department. It‚Äôs a great game over all I just have very little patience and I don‚Äôt like pressures from certain gameplay parts. I rage quit so often that it‚Äôs embarrassing.",4
"This is the best mobile game premise I‚Äôve ever seen. Open-word MMORPG with anime visuals, just awesome. The gameplay is excellent and entertaining, and the story in actually very well-though. However, there is currently too little to do, since the story and side quests are very few and the update rate is horrendous. 

But my biggest complaint is the broken gacha system. F2P players get barely any premium currency from quests and events, there is no permanent log in bonus, and the banners are extremely expensive. Also, the rates to get the characters you want are too small, and you need 90 pulls to get a mercy character, which might not even be the one you want. Very disappointing. Seriously, if this game wasn‚Äôt gacha I would say it is one of the best games ever made, mobile or otherwise. Please Mihoyo, make Genshin Impact more F2P-friendly. I really want this to give this game a 5-star review",3
"I love the game, I really do. The characters are neat, I love the open world roleplay style. It‚Äôs really fun to play this game. The only problem is that the first time I got this game I had black screens for days and then when I got it again a few weeks later, it works and I can actually play the game but I crash every like 30 minutes. I lower the settings (which you can only do after completely a long story tutorial instead of being able to do it as soon as possible to make the game smoother) but it still crashes. Honestly it crashes more if I mess with the settings even if I‚Äôm lowering the graphics settings. I still play the game (with it crashing and then having to go through the whole loading screen again) because I honestly, genuinely love playing this game, but just know that that is my experience.",3
"I have had this game for less than a week and I‚Äôm already in love. It‚Äôs asthetically pleasing, the combat systems and elemental reactions are outright amazing, and the storyline and level progression are top-notch as well. I only have one single suggestion, and it‚Äôs that when you are playing on single player you don‚Äôt need internet connection. I don‚Äôt really know about the inner mechanics so this might be a fundamentally impossible change, but if we could have the option to turn off multiplayer and play single player without internet connection that would be nice. Now, this is only a quality-of-life thing and in no way negatively impacts my opinion of the game, it‚Äôs still a wonderful game. It‚Äôs just a little thing that would be nice to have.",5
"I love this but some of my friends are gonna right a review on how there should be a trading feature, first of all, you need to be AR40 in order to trade, you can only trade with friends though and you can only trade for a 4star for 4star and 5star for 5star. I know we can trade on banners but sometimes we want characters that we don‚Äôt have or didn‚Äôt get from the banners, I was thinking we could only trade 2 times every 3 weeks, I felt like that was to strict but I was thinking we can‚Äôt just get the characters we want all the time because it wouldn‚Äôt make the game fun and we wouldn‚Äôt haft to get primos or fates anymore. So I‚Äôm still planning on how the trading feature would work. I love the game over all and I think you should add it in. But if you don‚Äôt that is okay.",4
"I love the game but there are some problems. First off, I wish we didn‚Äôt have to pay so much primo gems just for one wish. It‚Äôs takes awhile just to get a certain amount of primo gems just to use it all for a wish. Second of all, I wish we didn‚Äôt need to do certain story‚Äôs and events just to do limited events and when we finish them. The limited event is already ended or soon ending. Third of all, when doing certain things in quests or story‚Äôs, sometimes when we have to do something, we don‚Äôt have a guide of what to do. Which is really frustrating and confusing. That‚Äôs all for now, Hoyoverse. Please know that you do not need to consider this rant as something as you pay attention to. Thank you and have a great day! :)",4
"I love this game. I was playing when it first came out. Before the toxicity started from the fan base. I was blown away by the graphics and the overall mechanics of the game. Yet the grind became annoying after awhile to I took a break. However, I came back again . I took multiple breaks but kept coming back to this game. Despite the extensive and very annoying grinding and the annoying primo earnings. I have bought very little on this game. You don‚Äôt really need to buy anything and there really isn‚Äôt a point unless you want one of the handful of outfits, or if you‚Äôre short on primo and want to wish. I don‚Äôt really have many complaints about the game itself. Good and enjoyable game. I can‚Äôt really bring myself to quit it entirely",4
"I‚Äôm very disappointed at hoyoverse‚Äôs lack of diversity within the skin tones. Time and time again, fans have made it clear that they want more variety in skin tones. They want the characters from regions where dark skinned people live, to be represented within the game (especially if genshin is taking inspiration from those regions). 

The absolute refusal to add any character that is darker than the in-game characters (xinyan and Kaeya- the only two tan playable characters) is unacceptable. If you are to create a region that is based off of the Middle East and parts of Africa, then make the characters reflect that. Pale/tan are not the only skin tone in these regions and, if anything, darker skin tones ARE MORE COMMON in these areas. There is no reason that some non-African people are DARKER than these African inspired characters. 

The lore, the culture, the music, everything else that has been released for sumeru has been wonderful. It seems to capture the culture that Sumeru is inspired by wonderfully. But the character designs do not match that. You cannot go around and use REAL PEOPLES culture for profit and then turn around and NOT INCLUDE THEM in your game. This amount of disrespect is unfathomable. Please do better to represent the real human beings that play this game. Otherwise, you‚Äôre telling them that you outright hate them and will ultimately loose money from them. 

Do better.",1
This game is free I can‚Äôt believe this good of a game is free yes whales spend lots of money but I am f2p this game has no adds which some games that have in game purchases DO which is just offense because if you have this much money from whales DONT USE ADDS that‚Äôs something this game doesn‚Äôt have which is great! i love   It this game is so good so good I downloaded this game for laughs and it was amazing. The game is great the fandom is ehhh but that‚Äôs not their fault honestly. Great game please play I hate how the fandom blames mobile players for deleting of things in the game which if you do this. See this is why nobody likes you. But the good thing is that‚Äôs the fandom NOT THE REAL GAME the game is just so good SO GOOD please play if you have not already I am an addict and I love this game so much okay if you haven‚Äôt great game amazing game like wow!,4
"Sure Genshin has its problems, but I will still have to say that it's an amazing. I would really love if they had more representation for the newer Sumeru characters, not having this reputation is definitely hurting the game and creating a lot of controversial, but the good parts overweight the bass by a lot in my opinion. It's an open world game filled with many amazing and interesting characters, the game also has a great story line. My only other problem is the storage, a game with so much content is definitely gonna have a huge storage intake but I wish there was a way to delete old dialogue files from old events and story quests! 5/5 would definitely recommend playing!",5
"With Sumeru coming out soon and its characters, I have a question, why Is their skin white? Sumeru is supposed to be based off of the Middle East/ South Asia and yet their skin is paler then Eula‚Äôs. How hard it it to make a few of them not different shades of white. Just do it and actually represent the people of the culture you are taking from. There are already a lot of pale characters in game and having just a fee characters not be isn‚Äôt going to hurt you hoyo verse, its not. This isn‚Äôt the boogeyman, its just rep. This is just disrespectful to a lot of fans of color who support you and give money. And there is so much racism in the fandom hoyo verse that you have to be blind to it. This is just throwing oil into a burning fire hoyo verse, do better for once, its only a few characters and the design for the dendro archon can also be better, she looks like a Klee clone, at least giver her a darker skin tone, she‚Äôs the archon of Sumeru not shneznaya. If I could give zero stars I would.",1
"When I first started playing Genshin Impact, it was arguably the best game I‚Äôve ever played to the point I would abandon other games just to play Genshin Impact. However after about 2 months, I got to AR 50, the content of the game became repetitive and boring and resin really became a problem, especially when farming the artifacts. I could literally be stuck farming artifacts for weeks spending over thousands of resins just to get a decent set for my characters while also having to also spend resin on talents, mora, experience, weapon/character ascension materials. The developers must either increase resin regeneration rate/decrease resin cost, or rework the artifact domain to guarantee good artifacts in some way possible.",5
"This game is actually amazing, when I first downloaded this game I wasn‚Äôt really interested in it. The more I found out about the traveler and the travelers sister and the journey throughout Mondstat, Liyue, etc. It became so much more interesting. Especially the games quality and the bright visual effects. The elemental bursts were very surprising and they had caught my eye. I really like this game and I play it almost everyday. I am also fond of the Adventure Ranks, how they give us different Adventure Ranks and also give us rewards for completing 1 AR to another. I started this game back in 2020. I love it, and I hope to see more coming from the company mihoyo! 

Thank you for reading my review, have a wonderful day.",5
"so I loved zelda breath of the wild game, and when I saw this it kinda reminded me of the game so I downloaded it. I love it but I have some things to say. I suggest not to buy primogems because they‚Äôre super overpriced. One 10 pull that takes me about a week and a half to get costs about 30$. Another thing to fix would definitely be the quests. Some of the quests are so hard, it makes me want to quit the game. I get that it good that the quests aren‚Äôt easy but it‚Äôs VERY hard to complete some of them. My last thing is that you can‚Äôt do multiplayer mode if you haven‚Äôt completed some of the quests. I don‚Äôt really like this because if some tasks are so hard, you won‚Äôt be able to play with your friend for awhile. Besides that the game is amazing ü•∞",4
"First of all I‚Äôd like to say that these type of games gave me a lot of anxiety at first but thanks to the animation, soundtracks and characters I really love this game! Secondly, I don‚Äôt have a stable internet connection, but despite that I can still play genshin with even 900kbps. That‚Äôs like a dream lol bcs the graphics are still amazing, you can keep playing meanwhile the internet stabilizes or whatever. The only thing is that the update is a little bit too heavy but considering the graphics, sounds, movement of the character and all of the amazing details this game has, it is incredible that we can play it through our phones. Thanks for creating the game I‚Äôve been looking for a long time!!! Pd: make a kazuha rerun lmaoooo",5
"I absolutely love this game. I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and there‚Äôs not many games that I find capture my attention but Genshin is the complete opposite of that. I find the graphics, story line, even the music so addicting. This is the only game I have no regrets pulling an all nighter for even though I had tests the next day. The characters are incredibly detailed and (here‚Äôs me fangirling for a second but) the voices+story are just ‚ú®perfection‚ú®. I could literally fall asleep to the music in this game. They put so much effort into this game and it was worth every ounce of effort I put back. I 100% recommended this, but just a fair warning, you might want to hide your wallet because these primos are EXPENSIVE.",5
"I have been playing since day 1 and have spent a good deal amount of money on this game. I will give kudos to the developers for the open world design, but I am rating this 2 stars overall because of the number bugs and issues these game has. Normally, this isn‚Äôt a big deal since bugs are present in every game. The problem is that the developer, Mihoyo, refuses to address these issues or even acknowledge them. A simple ‚Äúwe‚Äôre looking into it‚Äù or even ‚Äúno‚Äù would give many players a peace of mind and closure. There‚Äôs no community manager and no attempts to foster any sort of interactive relationship with the players. The relationship between the players and Mihoyo is comparable to an abusive relationship. I am already taking the initial steps to get out of this abusive relationship by refusing to spend any more money until the developers become more responsive.",2
"Gacha is gacha, but Genshin impact takes the cake or your bank account and goes home. You need a powerful and new device to play this game. However, I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you want to kill the battery with heat. Best to play on pc. Console frames drop and are choppy. Huge time sink that has no payoff like a normal rpg because surprise it‚Äôs a Gacha! You can be free to play but you will be constantly enticed by the new 5 star or how that character can push further. Full potential of character isn‚Äôt even unlocked unless you‚Äôre lucky enough to pull multiple of that person. 

Play something else and just watch streamers who get paid to play this game. If you do, you‚Äôll be happier with your experience and so will your finances.

They should have just went with a base price like an indie or AAAtitle game. They money would still have come and players wouldn‚Äôt have another mobile /pc game running their pockets.",1
"This game is phenomenal but hindered by a company that went from generosity and camaraderie with its player base to silence, lessened rewards, and making each of us feel like a kid whose parents forgot their birthday. I NEVER spend money on gacha games but given the fact this game shows off as a passion project full of life, I wanted to support the company while also becoming increasingly interested in investing my time in this. Regardless of greed from our part as players, the lack of recognition of such a successful year due to their developers and the player base is just amazingly pathetic. Heck they even used to give our milestone rewards for millions of new players and now we look at not even enough rewards to level a character we own, but those ingredients we don‚Äôt want to farm, or even get more than a 10 pull comprised of 9 blue weapons and a 4*. Get it together.",2
"Genshin Impact is an AMAZING game, although I ran into a huge problem recently. On the quest ‚ÄúEmpty Abode‚Äù there is wind barrier, ok? So I had Venti open it then while i was on the trail to Stormterror‚Äôs Lair I teleported to the nearest Statue of The Steven (because I was dying) thinking ‚ÄúOh, it will let me continue when I get back‚Äù But, no. Now I cant continue the game/make progress with the game and had to make an entire new account because of it. So in all it‚Äôs a great game, really! But Im super bummed that I had to entirely restart because of one mistake! So my idea would be to make it so you can restart quests/redo them with less of a reward, or specifically towards the ‚ÄúEmpty Abode‚Äù quest, make it so once the 1st wind barrier is opened it says open. Other than that, I love the game! Amazing plot, amazing characters, AND especially amazing graphics! Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing, because it‚Äôs awesome! :D",3
"Great game, I love the open world style and that the game is free(which is why this isn‚Äôt 3-stars). The only problems I have with the game are as follows:
1. No controller support at the moment. This would solve SOOOO many control issues I have with the game.
2. Enemies regenerate life when returning to camp. Sounds ok right? Well not if you happen to cross the threshold that their dog chain allows them quite frequently. You could be battling a harder enemy only to be flung out of it‚Äôs reach and lose interest in you, making you lose your progress in the battle.
3. Climbing and gliding controls are odd. This could be in part to the camera angle, but the controls themselves are finicky. Sometimes I jump off of something and expect to glide only to tumble to the ground. Sometimes I want to climb something to escape but the character won‚Äôt even grab onto the thing I am trying to climb. This could possibly be fixed with future controller support added.

Anyway, I don‚Äôt want to come off as a hater, I really do enjoy the game and look forward to them adding more content later this month, perhaps even something listed above. I want to see this game succeed and would recommend trying it out.",4
"This is a very fun game, but I think there are some problems that I wanted to address whether or not it is fixed, my apologies. 

This game works off with pity (90 pulls is most likely going to be a five star) as for (10 pulls is gonna most likely get you a four star). I‚Äôve played this game a few months ago, about 2 months? I‚Äôm AR 53 and I have 3 five stars. (Let‚Äôs not count MC) But, my concern is when this game is fully updated and done whenever we actually get our sibling back. There would probably be a lot of characters out and many F2P‚Äôs (Not counting myself) may miss a lot of characters. My question is, will there ever be a time we can pick a five star? I feel like this would be amazing and help the community.",5
"I really love this game, its super cool & neat. The graphics are INSANE for a free game. it‚Äôs totally worth the space it takes up

the thing is; I‚Äôd like to see more things done for the multiplayer mode. Like could there be a duel option? Or even tasks that can only be completed in a group setting? I find that whenever i play with my friends we don't necessarily know what to do. I think It‚Äôd be cool to have a dueling mode (player level doesn‚Äôt even need to match up with each other, its jus so that people can have fun and get competitive) i just think the game would be more enjoyable in maulti player mode that way.

On another note; can we please be able to train animals, i always see those fox things and the ferrets and i want one so badly. It doesn't even need to have any benefits to having the pet, i jus want a lil buddy i can train to do tricks or something.",3
"The game is absolutely amazing. Combat is fun yet challenging, characters are all somewhat balanced. But there is one things that‚Äôs been bothering me since day 1. The game is to p2w. I know it‚Äôs a gacha game and it‚Äôs made to make money but as a strict f2p the game gets to grindy. A good example is the constant priomgem shortage. I am constantly out of primogems and only being able to accumulate around 5 just from running around and getting chests I will eventually not be able to get more. Sure the daily quest give some but it‚Äôs just not enough. Only getting 60 from the dailies is just to little and will cause some f2p‚Äôs to not play cause of the lack of material needed to get characters. I‚Äôm not asking much but if the daily gem amount you could get from the commissions was higher I‚Äôd be able to at least get one wish in once a day would be great",4
"Genshin Impact is now one of my favorite games. Genshin is smooth playing, beautiful, and has very few glitches that effect game performance. For example: I have not gotten stuck between two rocks in my entire 2 weeks I‚Äôve been playing. I have not glitched out or gotten stuck anywhere. I also just had my birthday and I was greeted with the best surprise. There‚Äôs so much lore too! I‚Äôm so happy to be part of this game. I‚Äôve gotten to do so much and I haven‚Äôt payed one cent. I was thinking tho that maybe ,when I have more money, to get something worth real money in game to support the game and it‚Äôs dev‚Äôs. This game should be like $25+ but it‚Äôs free. I was skeptical at first when getting the game, but I was pleasantly surprised and fell in love. 10/10 will/would play again.",5
"I have already put over 30 hours in to this game and am loving it so much. Great story. Incredible artwork and art design second time none. This is my favorite looking game maybe if all time. I love the character designs. The gameplay is varied and super engaging. And it‚Äôs free!

I plan on supporting the devs because I am having so much fun but this game packs a TON of content without spending a dime! 

Another impressive thing to me is how amazing this looks on my iPhone 8 Plus. Kind of an old phone but it runs and looks like a legit PS4 game! And I‚Äôm so excited about the PC mobile cross saves. I can play this on the go and then kick back and enjoy the incredible art and world design on my big computer screen and it looks incredible. Just try it out. I am so in love!",5
"Game looks good but what is the point if I can‚Äôt even stay in game and farm to lvl. Majority, need resins/ energy/ takin/ is needed to play. Even If you can pay, I don‚Äôt think u will ever have that satisfied. This freaking game is sink hole for your time and wallet! This is the type of game you are going to download and play? This is 2020 and I felt like I‚Äôm back to the time that when mobile game started! You gotta pay to farm and enjoy which is dumb. I do not understand why they even listed under the FREE words! Another game with a bunch of B.S. risen or energy systems! In this GACHA gaming community, a bunch of people doesn‚Äôt speak out the truth! GACHA equal sink hole for your wallet and it‚Äôs even make it worse with those strictly or stingy rise/ energy system! That‚Äôs pretty stupid play!
AND DONT THINK THAT I DIDNT SPENT! I just feels like this game making me very uncomfortable with stupid system which is clearly RESIN!
Because system like this exit! Starting today toward, I will never spend a penny for GACHA GAMING!
Game I played and spent thousand of dollars:
- Summoner War (3 years and more) log in only. 
- Puzzle and dragon (been more than 3 years) still enjoying and playing lightly.
-Epic Seven ( 1 year) still playing .
Current - GENSHIN IMPACT ( just like summoner war at start, NOT Satisfied with RESIN system) please fix, so I could stay in this game and play for longer! 
I am not bragging! I am speaking the truth!",1
"This game is a really good game and beautiful and loved it at first but end game, gacha rates and progress of characters are the worst I‚Äôve experienced. Enjoy the story but quit after that if you are F2P player.

At first this game is enjoyable but once you get to Adventure Rank 40+ and done everything it is all about maxing out and grinding till you drop game.

End game materials will take you YEARS to complete because 1 character might take 6months to max out even if you‚Äôre the luckiest gamer in RnG history (materials are so rare and RnG + can only be farmed once a WEEK).

Gacha rates are sooo LOW that the developers refused to show the drop rate and made it to 50pulls guarantee which sounds good to many but really it‚Äôs just saying that mandatory 50pulls for your S hero so whale if you want 7 of them to max out or to even be viable to end game bosses.

Also you need many good different heroes to play because of elemental properties for different enemies. The free heroes are trash and boring.

Hero progression is one thing to worry about but wait there‚Äôs more!! you got artifacts with RnG base stats, what about weapons? well Yeah! you need good weapons too!.  So grind till you‚Äôre wallet is empty or grind till you say it quits.

This game is soo grindy with little rewards, it will stress you more than relax you. RnG is the worse and very P2W/Whale focus game.

Enjoy the story but quit after if you‚Äôre F2P.",1
"Lets get the basic things out of the way, beautiful game, possibly the best on mobile, fun combat for the most part and great character design. 

The issues I have with this game are pretty miniscule to be honest, a good chunk of the main quests is dialogue which is fine I guess. But I do say that the reluctance to give primogems is pretty bad, I guess it‚Äôs a good amount of what you get/satisfaction for getting it ratio but it ducks waiting a month or so to maybe get someone.

 Thats pretty much all the complaints though, other problems people have like whitewashing and other things, are miniscule problems that you can ignore. Just play it, form your own opinion, and see if you like the game.",5
"Ok so I know a 1 star review may seem harsh, but I need to get this point straight to the developers. I know my IPhone SE first gen is not technically compatible with the game. The game still technically runs, but everything is pitch black, everything from the sky to the water, to even my entire screen. Next comes the issue that the cutscenes are super buggy and glitch out to the point the screen just freezes while the sounds in the background just bug out. If it‚Äôs possible, I really wish and hope that the game one day becomes optimal for phone like mine: the iPhone SE first gen. If I could get a response from the developers on this, it would be really appreciated. I know how good and awesome this game will be, but due to the fact I can‚Äôt play it right now because of the issues above, and that I don‚Äôt have consoles or a PC to play it on, I will keep my 1 star review. If the game becomes optimal for older devices though, I will gladly change this review to 5 stars.",1
"I will say I am so proud of this game and it‚Äôs so fun. I just got sayu last night and i am so excited. I do want more short characters in because they are so fun to play around with. I also got dori and she‚Äôs so cute and adorable. Genshin is the best game ever and i will play for hours a day and it‚Äôs so much fun. It‚Äôs not boring where you do one thing and you have to do more. It‚Äôs like one of those endless games. It is hard to defeat some monsters like on quests and stuff, but that makes it more difficult and fun. I also love the world join requests because last night me and my sister played together in the same world and it‚Äôs also fun to take a picture and pose. Thank you again genshin, and i hope you keep it up!!",5
"Okay, here‚Äôs one thing, this game is so beautiful, and so much other reasons I love this game, m8. Basically, I‚Äôm A.R 54, so I‚Äôve been playing for a long time. I have 5 other accounts, that‚Äôs how much this game rules. Lemme just tell you, in the beginning, it‚Äôs all paimon paimon paimon. But then through out the game, it gets even more fun, dudes. Right now I‚Äôm saving for Nilou and Layla. There‚Äôs so much characters in the game right now, everyone is mind blown. About 7 more new characters are coming in. I think if u download this game, you‚Äôll get interested in it right away. Fr. Please download the game. It‚Äôll make ur life a whole lot better, m8
                                                                     Akokxing",5
I would not recommend this game to a friend at all. I fell into the gacha trap and spent tons of money just to unlock characters and their weapons. Even after grinding the game and saving up primos for so long there is a chance that you won‚Äôt get the character you always wanted because of the reset mechanic. There is a 50/50 chance you‚Äôd get a qiqi instead of the featured banner character. Lot of times it takes 90 gems just to unlock a 5 star character?! That moment when you got a qiqi instead gives you that feeling the need to spend money. Because you got robbed with your hard work. You spent so much time grinding the missions and saving primos only to get a c2 Jean you never asked for. And it‚Äôs all thanks to this gacha system. It is basically gambling and it‚Äôs not healthy at all. I was one of them. I haven‚Äôt touched this game since last year and I‚Äôve never been happier. DA BIAN game!,1
"I might only be a kid but I think you should continue reading, I got this game and loved it, the next day I went to school and found out my best friend also loves this game, me and her would play it together and I would sometimes just let strangers into my game (you must except them in if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable) and every person I met was so nice and sweet and if I didn‚Äôt want them in I could just click something and they would be gone, in this game you go there thrilling adventures and get characters along the way, and it‚Äôs so beautiful, I love to draw and love anime and this is amazing the great works of art and coding is incredible it shows true talent and is inspiring. So I suggest you get this game! Enjoy‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"So a friend introduced me to Genshin Impact in November of 2021 and I have started playing ever since (I am AR47 now) and I must say, I have never played a game like this before. All the characters the story line and events are amazing! The only thing that I have toi tell you is that some one the story quests (such as the Chasm Delvers and The Dragonspine Side Quest) are sometimes really long. For example, you need to complete the Chasm Delvers so you can complete an archon quest after completing the Inzauma archon quest. For events, there are also a tone of quests you need to complete. If new players start to join in a year or so they will be overwhelmed by how much they need to complete. So I urge HoYoverse to change some of the quest requirements for events. Thank you.",5
"Honestly I‚Äôve only been playing for a little bit on mobile, and I have to say, the graphics, storyline, and scenery in general is amazing. I love the characters and how they all have their own stories. I also love the ancient lore and everything about it. I also like how instead of it being a one difficulty level it gets harder as you progress. Yes, there are somethings to be worked on like the multiplayer experience and maybe some of the leveling challenges (maybe characters but I think they look good). I can‚Äôt believe people are giving this app 1 star just because they don‚Äôt like stats and damage a character does. This game is amazing, especially for it being on mobile.",5
"I played this game since it got released and I love every aspects of Genshin. It has so much to explore in the beginning but as you level up things get different. I don‚Äôt feel like enjoy playing the game as I used to because of how grindy the game really is and the wish system is pathetic. I wished for Xiao for 60 times but end up having nothing. If you want to keep up with the world level, you really have to put in a tremendous amount of hours just to level up your weapons and characters. You can pay to get primos but if you want to play the game for free, you will need to consider the amount of times you are going to waste to just sit down and grind for primos to get a new characters, it‚Äôs extremely hard if you are an AR 45 and up.
The game doesn‚Äôt have ending story yet and hopefully it will soon. Developers don‚Äôt listen to players most of the time and I feel like I tortured myself just to spend my time to play this game.",1
Alright so this game was so addicting at the beginning till you hit about level 30 and then you realize all the characters are locked behind the gacha wishing system which wouldn‚Äôt be bad but no if you want them you spend a month grinding for gems or spend hundreds of dollars. The whole system it built to make you spend money but once you finally get to the end game there is nothing. The events are repetitive it‚Äôs either fight the same enemies over and over or fight a boss you have already beaten multiple times. The story question are filled with unnecessary dialogue and grinding relics is just beat the same dungeon over and over again. You will almost certainly not get what you want from relic farming and when you do it‚Äôs not that rewarding because there is literally not end game. Leveling up characters requires you to farm a boss over and over and you have to run around the map collecting materials.,1
"No but seriously I am in love with this game, what really sucked me in was that it reminded me of playing Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild for the first time but gatcha. ü§£ It also very quickly became my comfort game when I was going through a hard time in my life and it still is whenever I want a quick getaway. Getting new characters feels like opening a Christmas gift in Christmas morning and I always feel like a little kid whenever I‚Äôm able to pull a new character from the banner. But overall amazing characters, has SOOOOO MUCH TO DOO!!! Amazing story line and lots of lore with different characters, lots of side quests. I‚Äôm just in love with it I HIGHLY recommend this game!!!!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for nearly a year now at this point and it‚Äôs been so. much. fun. There is so much to explore and do I‚Äôm always discovering new things. Where this game shines is all the mini games hidden around the world while you grind. It breaks up the monotony grinding can have. As such I haven‚Äôt been this invested in a game since FF12 where I clocked over 1,000 hours. As I grew older I navigated away from games because I feel the games got too serious. The fun went out of it. This game brings back all that childhood excitement in spades. I just wish they‚Äôd add TV OS and Mac to the useable device list. I‚Äôm not a console type of guy but that doesn‚Äôt mean I wouldn‚Äôt like to see this running native on the big screen.",5
"alright, so I‚Äôll start with the cut scenes since i‚Äôm an artist. everything is so gorgeous, from the story telling to the art itself. the characters designs are all so unique and impressive, not to mention how many noteworthy voice actors (for both the original and the english translation) there are!

sometimes you may find yourself stuck on a specific quest or side story, but you just need to grind a bit to progress the storyline. kaeya is probably my favorite character at the moment, i‚Äôm a sucker for flirts lol. love this game to bits!

edit: one thing i will say, the wishing system is horrid. it‚Äôs very difficult to get new characters through wishes, and in that aspect i think this game can definitely improve.",5
"The game is playable f2p but it is a seriously impossible grind that way to try experience the nuances of this open world charter simulator.

Experiencing what this game has to offer will cost you and that the trick. The longer amount of time they can get you to invest (getting nowhere), then the more likely you mentally offset the high cost greatly compared to that amount of invested time and plans for future time dedication. The pricing and the leveling System is a well constructed psychological trap for your money. So no matter how good aspects of the game are this game gets one star due to cost. Mainly because there are for cheaper options that will grant the same levels of enjoyment‚Ä¶ like buying a backbone and playing GTA San Andreas. Or buy a PS5 and playing the built in free game.  Most freemium Micro transactions games are not free‚Ä¶ there is a mental fortitude cost that is no fun even if they don‚Äôt get your mula",2
"just like you‚Äôd think. mihoyo is the most incredible studio- i loved honkai but oh my god this is the best game i have ever played. considering it‚Äôs a massive, extremely graphics heavy, quest based open world game, you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be super slow, but my iPad runs it flawlessly. the story is compelling and well written, the character design is GORGEOUS and i love that every character is well rounded, fully voiced, and has their own battle style, and the world itself is HUGE and super immersive. there‚Äôs always little things to discover and play with, and with the added fun of foraging and cooking it‚Äôs super nice to go through the wilds of teyvat and find yourself some food and ore! i am overall SO enamored with this game. there‚Äôs nothing else like it.",5
"They recently put out a character that doesn‚Äôt do what it was supposed to do. Raiden. It is a ‚Äútop tier‚Äù character, and synergizes with nothing. In their beta test she synergized well with several teams. They nerfed her at launch and she‚Äôs roughly ok to so-so now. Everyone, including me, spent lots of money to get her expecting solid results. She‚Äôs subpar, and worthless. Miyoho backpedaled and gave us $2 as an apology. It‚Äôs a money game since it takes hundreds of dollars to get great characters. I don‚Äôt like that they rip you off, then say nothing about it, and when they do it‚Äôs a worthless overture. Their one year anniversary reward? Grinding 50 hours for $5. Yeah, that‚Äôs some reward for a population that‚Äôs kept you going for a year straight with millions of dollars. Now you‚Äôre just milking players. One star is my rating bc I‚Äôve spent cash on this game, and now it‚Äôs basically just a trash fire of ignoring players. I‚Äôm a victim, and I don‚Äôt think other players should be victims.",1
"It is a shame that the developers are like this. One year ago we got tons rewards for giving this game the time of day but now the rewards from events are lesser than just grinding for 2 hours. That‚Äôs not even including the amount of balance issues like how they thought it would be a great idea to balance the game‚Äôs future content around a limited-time units that hasn‚Äôt even had a rerun yet and characters that are absolutely terrible haven‚Äôt even gotten a single buff to their kits. Seeing the state the community is in its no wonder people are so dissatisfied with miHoYo‚Äôs recent actions especially when compared to their actions on their other game Honkai Impact 3rd. If there is one thing all Gacha Games must get right is there Anniversary Rewards and what does miHoYo do... why they go below the Gacha Game Standard and tell the community to do promotions for the game for them.

If you wanna play a game with story and waifus/husbandos just play Fate/Grand Order",1
"I never would have thought that I‚Äôd ever be able to enjoy a Gacha game, but Genshin impact is out of this world. The world is massive and gorgeous and every character is fun to play. The best and worst part about this game is the combat. It‚Äôs fluid, flashy and fun, but it‚Äôs far from challenging. Enemies don‚Äôt bother dodging your attacks and you can just rank most of the enemy attacks, the pve system is built around trying to kill a certain amount of enemies in a certain amount of time and it takes a lot of fun away knowing that the only good way to build your characters is damage upon damage. Being a tank for your co op teammates is useless because you can just have someone heal the health back while dishing out crazy amounts. There should be another Meta other than just stacking crit damage and crit chance on every character.",4
"i started genshin about 4 months ago, and i‚Äôm ar50 rn. the amount of detail and effort put into the game is shown every single day i play, from the connection of characters (one of ambers voice lines is connected to eulas special dish, chongyun and xingqiu have similar vision designs) the beautiful music transitions, from idle to combat to boss music, the voice lines of characters when the environment changes (changes when it‚Äôs raining, sunny, windy, morning, evening, etc). early game may seem boring, but after you reach adventure rank (ar) 12, daily commissions start and it‚Äôs easy to see how this game is so appealing. the open world system of genshin lets the player get lost in the world, discovering beautiful scenery and fun puzzles. the game can be played casually, without the character caring about damage or bosses, just running around and finding chests. although the wishing system may seem unfair, the player can easily rely on starter characters to get through ar25, and beyond that if the player is still continuing through the game, they probably have dedicated some time to it. genshin is an extremely fun and immersive game, and i love it.",5
"This game takes all the cake for mobile games. I, a mobile gamer, am exposed to a lot of low tier gacha games considering that most of the amazing ones are on either pc or console. When Genshin Impact came out, I just knew I had to try it out! Once I saw the short cut scene in the beginning, I knew I would fall in love. That, I did. The story is amazing, the character designs and storyline are on point, the graphics are spot on, and the storyline is high class! I couldn‚Äôt believe that this game was free. As I played it everyday, I learned to understand it more and grow to love it with my understanding. Alongside my understanding, my connection with the characters simply began to grew, and made me not want to ever leave the game. Thank you, mihoyo, for bringing this wonderful masterpiece for us mobile gamers.",5
"Genshin is an amazing game and I enjoy it and it‚Äôs very creative but I do have one complaint. The regions are based on several different cultures but with the recent showing and reveal of Sumeru and the talk of new character rumors, we have a lack of colored representation in the game. Sumeru is based on a couple regions and those regions do have tan and darker skinned individuals in them. If you are going to make a region inspired by a culture and specific race then make the characters and NPC‚Äôs match the people living in that region. It‚Äôs just respectful and makes sense.

We love the game but there is a lack of diversity in skin tones and we need a change. Please listen to this, you will profit more if you make characters that match the current region at the time. I know that‚Äôs important to your company.",4
"This game might just be the best mobile RPG I‚Äôve played. EVER. Hands down. I‚Äôve not encountered any sort of pay to win type junk which is probably good because this game just happens to be more addictive than I had first anticipated (please though dear developers, don‚Äôt make pay to win a thing) Takes up some hefty space but when you get a game that could easily compare to that of a console game, well, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. Worth the space, worth your time...I just really love this game...although one thing I‚Äôm a little upset about is I saw an ad on this game, it showed the character Gigi. And I‚Äôve been trying to wish her into my game from the second I found out how that was possible. However I will continue to try.",5
"The thing I liked most about this game is that I was able to play it day in and day out (for free) without a single ad, and it wasn‚Äôt until I hit a certain level that I decided to throw some cash at them to support how wonderful of a game this is. I love all the loot and the mass bag space to hold it all. The combat is creative and immersive, as well as the world with something to kill or collect around every corner. There‚Äôs a lot of lore too if you‚Äôre into that sorta thing xD. 

A few complaints...some sort of healer in town would be nice. Getting food to heal is a chore, on top of the ‚Äúbeing full‚Äù mechanic, which is a pain if you‚Äôre trying to take down a boss. Healing in an RPG should not be this difficult. There‚Äôs Alchemy, but no Health Potions? This makes zero sense.",5
"Before november, I used to be able to play this game pretty seamlessly. Of course some things took some time to fully load, but that wasn't much of a problem. I loved the genshin world and how interactive i could be. I was able to explore everything to my hearts content and collect new and cool characters!! But now, when i try to go into the game, it just shows me a 1/2 black, 1/2 white screen, and doesn't even let me open the game

This is different from a lagging issue or a wifi issue. The game straight up won't let me in. Idk if it's an iphone 7 issue, but i used to be able to play this game (up until recently). I really love this game and i really hope i can continue playing",5
"I never review any type of all, ever. But this game is simply too fantastic to not let everyone know about it. How this is a free game is beyond me. So the style is very similar to breath of the wild, even down to the small puzzles everywhere that were used to unlock the deku seeds, are in this game masterfully made. The combat is unique and very original , and the map is massive. There really isn‚Äôt anything bad to say about this game, even the way you fight when combining elements , and having things like fire burn and destroy shields, while lightning is highly effective when it‚Äôs raining, and how fire makes ice explode when enemies are frozen, is all amazing. You guys deserve all the credit for a game I will spend hours on and gladly support in the future. Keep it up guys this is a masterpiece.",5
"From Your very first game to now. Mihoyo has never disappointed. Genshin impact is just like the others. A game that excels in quality and is a game that all future mobile products should take as an example. Mihoyo has set a new high for mobile gaming. Whether it be in their graphics, content, story, characters, music, and their anime aspect, there‚Äôs not a single disappointment. I‚Äôm in love with this game. I have it on my ps4 and pc, and now on my phone. The graphics are absolutely astonishing on mobile, and get even better on console or computer. For any of you that have had problems with the game. From what I know, the game won‚Äôt work properly UNLESS you have IPhone 8 and newer. Thank you Mihoyo for this masterpiece and I hope you continue to surprise us.",5
"Hello I been playing this for over a year so over and it finally hit me and my friend today and we just wanted to point some things we think maybe could be added but just to let you know before we start it is an amazing game and we think maybe trading characters or objects with people could we allowed let‚Äôs say that someone wants my character for a character I want then we could trade it for them that‚Äôs all- and Genshin website hasn‚Äôt been working for me for like a couple days when every I tried it would just not let me pass the ‚Äòflip ur device for better (forgot-)‚Äô
Just want to let you know and this app is honestly really amazing",5
"Upon entering Sumeru, I had hope for proper representation and diversity in the playable characters and npcs. It is clear that there is a lack of research and stereotypes coming into play while looking at the Sumeru designs. The game needs more diversity when it comes to skin tone variety. There are only two tan characters, who you have consistently lightened time and time again. The tan characters you have are full of stereotypes as it is. Looking at the same skin tone over and over again is boring, all the designs are starting to look the same and it‚Äôs very disappointing as somebody who has spent thousands of dollars on this game. I do not plan on contributing a dollar to this game until the issue is fixed. Do better. Listen to the players who come from the cultures you are supposed to be representing because clearly your team can‚Äôt put in an ounce of research before designing a culture-heavy character and are only thinking about money.",1
Hey so I‚Äôve been playing this game for quite a while even though I haven‚Äôt played for a year I feel like everyone deserves better awards especially cause people actually spend money on this game especially me. So please try fixing the anniversary awards it would really mean a lot to everyone and it would be more fair since most of us spent money on this game. He‚Äôs some ideas maybe you can make some custom skins for traveler and give us more fates and primo gems I know this is probably a lot for mihioyo but I think we all deserve this for all our hard work and money spending and of course the Va‚Äôs of some characters who play this game and other people who helped develop this game should be awarded with something great for helping develop for a entire year!,4
"So I‚Äôve heard your basing Sumeru off of Swana, but you‚Äôve made all of the sumeru characters neon white. They‚Äôre whiter than diluc and that man is PASTY. I know this is a fantasy game, but how are you able to do such a great job on Yun Jin but you can‚Äôt do the same for the other regions? You need to give the sumeru and natlan characters darker skin since you‚Äôre basing their regions off of places where people mostly have darker skin. As much as I‚Äôm interested in the story and wish to see it progress, your lack of representation is disappointing. Not only have you failed at representing more skin tones, but you‚Äôve also failed the people your basing the regions off of. There are only two tanned characters in this game, TWO. and we haven‚Äôt seen gameplay of them in nearly a YEAR. How would you feel if you were represented incorrectly? You‚Äôd be upset, correct? Please change the skin tones of the sumeru cast, and please don‚Äôt make the same mistake for natlan",1
"Although I enjoy playing the game, it‚Äôs been going downhill. Recently they have started showing leeks for the ‚ÄòSumeru‚Äô region. The characters have pretty designs, but there is one thing about them. Only one character‚Äôs skin is even close to darker.. And when I say that I mean it‚Äôs more of a tan color.üòû The rest, they are lighter than MONDSTADT characters. (Mondstadt is based off Germany while Sumeru is based off South West Asia and North Africa) That isnt ok. Many players have asked for more diversity COUNTLESS times, yet we never get it. üòê Another thing is, all of the characters are insanely skinny. They have had many chances to make characters plus-sized. For example, Ganyu. Ganyu is a character in Liyue who is supposed to struggle with gaining weight fast. This would have been a PERFECT chance to make her plus-sized, yet she ended up being insanely skinny.üòí All of these are problems, and we want them fixed. ü´§",2
"hoyoverse wants their games to reach a global scale. they put tremendous amounts of research into other cultures for the regions in the game, mondstadt and inazuma, and remain respectful in doing so. yet why is it that in terms of skin color there are only 2 characters in the entire game who are tanned? every NPC from Sumeru has the same pale skin. Considering Sumeru is supposedly based of middle eastern cultures, this would be innacurate. Yes there are pale skinned middle eastern folk but those who aren‚Äôt feel so underrepresented. if hoyoverse wants to appeal to a global scale they would put as much respect and research in different cultures as they have in german and japanese culture. where is the respect ? all international fans are asking is that there is some diversity and representation in the characters they know and love. i liked genshin impact but the ignorance and orientalism is killing my love of the game. if this is never fixed, this game will see outstanding lows in playerbase. fix this. respect cultures. respect people.",1
"First and foremost‚Ä¶thank you so much for creating such a masterpiece‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been attached to many games before but this one is‚Ä¶different.  I‚Äôve never loved a game this much, and Mondstat feels like home to me!! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a single moment that I would complain about Genshin impact. This is there type of game I dreamed of playing when I was a kid.  I do have to say I worry a lot about not getting the characters I want sometimes, but then I remind myself that is part of the game and it keeps everyone from all having the same characters!! The character designs also are absolutely gorgeous, very difficult to draw sometimes but absolutely stunning!! So once again, thank you!",5
"I wish I could write a good review, but I‚Äôm extremely angry. The new ‚Äòthrough the mists‚Äô quest came out in 2.2. I was very excited. I went to check the list of quests and it wasn‚Äôt there. That wasn‚Äôt a problem and I went down the the adventures guild like another person did in a video. I did the quest and it took me hours to complete. I then logged out of Genshin, logged back in an hour later, and the fog was back! I checked the quests and the mist one still wasn‚Äôt there. I logged in and out again, but the fog didn‚Äôt leave. I am very upset because now I have wasted my time, the fog is back, and I‚Äôm going to have to redo it all which I do not want to do. The quest doesn‚Äôt even pop up and I think the reason it reset was because it wasn‚Äôt even in my list of quests to do in the first place. Please fix this. I want my time back and I want the fog gone, but I don‚Äôt want to waste time doing the quest AGAIN when I already have done it.",1
"this isn't the games fault so that's why I'm keeping it at a 5 star rating, my phone doesn't have a lot of storage and holy crap.. genshin takes up so much space, I've been struggling to update the 2.1 update no more negativity, the game is really fun and I love how the game isn't always forcing you to go somewhere and you can explore on your own time and it's really fun exploring with friends too, I really love the coop feature. the music is so beautiful as well!! so calming it can almost put me to sleep, I feel really calm and not stressed out all the time whilst playing. thank you so much for this game, I'm also planning on re downloading honkai impact if make enough space,, keep up the great work mihoyo!!!",5
The anniversary has to be the worst I experience of all Gacha games I ever played. Hardly much rewards. Not much that ‚Äúshines‚Äù ‚ÄúAnniversary‚Äù it feels like any other update or event. Last event that felt like celebration was the xiao lantern. Getting 4 star for free felt a meaning in the celebration for everyone to remember. But now with this anniversary having nothing. No one will remember but a bad memory. If you wanna listen. Listen to us what we want. I highly suggest giving a free 5 star of choosing standard wise of character or weapon or heck both if being selfless to the community. This will make the game seem much better and give a great memory. What is holding you back Mihoyo? Is time to bring a celebration and bring good memory to yourself and us players. Is time for change and listen to us more. If you want the game to become more successful. Thank you for taking time reading this. One of your players that truly enjoy this game.,1
"listen, i love this game. it has beautiful character designs, character stories, an interesting plot line, fun events and the graphics are beautiful. genshin is truly a successful rpg game that i have grown to love! i‚Äôm ar 53 and have spent over a thousand dollars on these lovable characters and beautiful weapons. it‚Äôs grand. BUT. the company truly does not care about its community or players. the rewards are small and cheap, they ask artists for free promotion and art in exchange for 100 primogems (not enough for a single wish), and time and time again they are expressing that they will do fhe care minimum when rewarding players and artists in the community. most of us have spent thousands of dollars promoting and playing this game, and it‚Äôs a spit in face from mihoyo to give so little in return. i do not recommend u get hooked on this game as i did, and for other artists i 100% recommend you refrain for working on art for them for as little as 100 primos. your art is worth more.",1
"I‚Äôve been plying this game for about a month or so now, and it‚Äôs a really beautiful and action packed game!! The storyline and such is so cool. I really love that it‚Äôs pc x mobile so i can play with (almost) everyone. The recent summertime adventure was so adorable, but it also had a LOT of bugs imo. The mechanics were a little off for me, but that was about it. I wish it was easier to get info on how wishes work/ how you get enough materials or whatever to wish?? That  was kind of confusing, and not explained well. I also hope that we soon have the option to appear offline when playing after you‚Äôre able to co-op. Sometimes I just wanna ride solo and not have to worry about notifications popping up when someone wants to join my world. ALSO, THE COMMUNITY IS SO NICE AND UNDERSTANDING TY SO MUCH GUYSSS ü•∫üíñ",4
"About 60 hours of great gameplay in a beautiful open world without even touching the gacha system, all for free. After that it becomes your typical daily grind gacha and has about 10-30 mins of daily gameplay. If you‚Äôre not familiar with gacha games then this is where you might start to get bored, but IMO the game is still well worth your time. Not the most generous gacha game in terms of free gems and not the greatest rates either, but don‚Äôt let that scare you away from experiencing this game. Truly a cut above typical mobile gacha games. Take your time and enjoy the scenery, this is a strictly pve game with no ladder system so there is absolutely no rush. I‚Äôve been playing since launch last September and still play daily.",5
"I love this game, and my review would be a 5* if not for a few problems. First off, as many can see, the characters are not diverse enough. I‚Äôd love to see more unique designs, as well as more skin colors. Also, when wishing for characters, it takes a lot to get one 5* without getting super lucky! Maybe, on the standard banner, pity could kick in early as most people don‚Äôt wish there regularly. My last suggestion would be to make primogems more readily available. Once you reach high AR, I‚Äôd say around 50, the ways to get primogems are ver limited, in daily commissions, events, and a few other ways. Otherwise, I highly recommend it - Its definitely a game that will keep you awake playing it, or hanging off every minute waiting for a new update.",4
"this is by FAR the best mobile game i've ever played. the graphics are stunning, the music is beautiful, the story is intriguing, and the game is just incredibly addicting. i've been playing since a week or two after the launch when i kept hearing about it, and i thought i would give it a try. let's just say that this masterpiece exceeded my expectations by MILES. i can't put into words how much i love playing this game. i look forward to playing it every day and i think it's intriguing beyond words. whenever i open the game, it's like i'm transported to another world. 

every challenge in the game is fun to play, the battles are engaging, and open world exploration is stunning. this will definitely be my favorite game for a LONG long time.",5
I love this game it‚Äôs so much fun to play but when it comes to wishes I‚Äôm so unlucky my sister has all the characters I want and I have one or two she wants but I‚Äôm too unlucky to get the ones I want and my sister is willing to trade some one or two of her characters for some of mine but we can‚Äôt trade I really want the characters Diona and Bennett but I just can‚Äôt get them after so many wishes I just really want at least one of them. I‚Äôve been playing for a while now and I only have 4 or 5 characters you don‚Äôt just get for free my sister has been playing for less and has way more so if you could add trading that would be amazing or just for characters would be fine. Thanks :),5
"Very good game I recommend it 100% I play on my iPhone 7 plus and even though it is not recommended I love this game I spend flawed every day to play and keep moving forward as soon as it came out I played it but due to problems I could not  continue and now that I am back I love to continue making this game mark a before and after in these types of games and I hope you continue to improve it and optimize it very well because the work you did in this game is incredible but I would like to make some suggestions.  

I WOULD LIKE THEM TO ADD IN MULTIPLAYER MODE TOWARDS MORE MORRAS WHERE WE FACE MANY POWERFUL BOSSES AND TO EARN REWARDS OR JUST FOR HAVING FUN IT WOULD BE GOOD BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A LOT THAT IS SAID IN THE ONLINE MODE BUT I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT EXCEEDED IN THE ONLINE MODE  PEOPLE HAVE MORE BETTER AND THAT'S ALL.",5
"Gave a 1 star review because mainly of account security issues. The company has had two security vulnerabilities exposed in the past few months already (mind you, this is a company founded in 2012 and has had lots of experience in these types of games). First one was how easily hackers could grab your phone number if you linked it, and the second was your email. And now, apparently, there‚Äôs a way for hackers to get your name from your linked social media accounts (especially Facebook) very easily as long as they know your password.

The community‚Äôs been trying to push for 2FA because security is important. Imagine spending a hundred or so on an account and that it can easily be hacked through brute force. They don‚Äôt notify you if your email/phone number gets unlinked either. And what‚Äôs more, they‚Äôre most likely aware of these, but haven‚Äôt fixed them. And they haven‚Äôt made an announcement addressing these issues.

At this point, making an account is all at-your-own-risk. Until they fix the vulnerabilities and start listening to the players more often, only then will I change this review.

Yes, it‚Äôs a great game with great characters, amazing design, wonderful music and a fun rpg element to it. But that all comes at a cost that your account can be taken out of nowhere.",1
I love love this game it‚Äôs so fun and interesting and definitely addicting. When I was on a quest ( and this treasure goes to )  and I went to the tree in  lingju pass. And as I was fighting the characters sometimes they would teleport in middle of the battle to where they spawned and would regain all their health. I after an hour of trying to kill the bad guys managed to get 2 of them. But the last one the purple one no matter how many times I hit him he gets a little bit low in health then teleports back and regains all his health again. I wouldn‚Äôt mind it as much if it hadn‚Äôt already been hard to get him low in health... üòÖ anyways I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ment to be like that or it‚Äôs a glitch but either way love the game.,5
"Don‚Äôt read any further, just download it. It‚Äôs honestly incredible, there‚Äôs no reason this shouldn‚Äôt be on Apple Arcade or cost money. It has more charm than most triple a games I‚Äôve played. The ‚Äúguide‚Äù (basically Navi or fi from Zelda) is the the first character in that role that doesn‚Äôt make me want to pull my hair out. The combat and story are surprisingly fun. The only thing I would change about the game (besides a few quality of life improvements) is having the follower characters be able to fight with you when you‚Äôre not controlling them, but I assume this was left out because the game is already pushing the limit on my phone. Im really hoping for a sequel and at this point I don‚Äôt care if I would have to pay money for it.",5
OK so my eight year old son was playing this game and I saw him crying and I asked him why he was crying and he said he was trying to be like this like monster which was like in a cube form and it was like made out ofWind or something and he was like he said he was going to be there but he died and he started crying the neighbors called the police I told the police nothing was wrong my son was just crying because he lost a game of something and I told the neighbors everything was fine and yeah now I‚Äôm making this stink to tell people to not play it you can still play it I‚Äôm not being a haterI would just not let my child play it because it can make them cry and I don‚Äôt want to please call me back,4
"it‚Äôs honestly too much work to constantly save up your pay real gems but then have the urge to use it on any of the new banners that come out with new characters. when you start off you automatically get either one of the twins you pick as you continue the game and you go through the three wind temples you automatically get Amber, Kaeya and Lisa. When goin on with the game to fighting Storm terror, you use Jean, Diluc, and Venti. once that commission is completely over you never get the chance to obtain a Venti or Diluc or Jean. once that storyline or commission is completely over you then automatically get Barbara which is after adventuring 18. so why not get characters after completing importing commissions? but also havin us waist time getting small amounts of pirogems from chest, small commissions, or the ruins?",3
"very little skin tone diversity in it's characters. 99% of the characters in the game are extremely pale and the characters that are darker are barely tan. this game has regions that are based off of real life. even in areas based off of middle east, egpyt, africa, and south asia the probably 90% of playable characters are extremely pale and atleast 70% of the npcs are extremely pale. not to mention that regions outside of that area don't have any darker skinned npcs. and only two darker skinned playable characters from other regions. one region having no darker skinned characters at all. there are over 50 characters in this game. one of the characters is based off of nubian queens and the chaarcter is darker skinned compared to other characters in the game but VERY pale when put into comparison of irl people and especially the actual nubian queens who some of the darkest skinned people. blatant whitewashing. also, the character xinyan has several hurtful black stereotypes written into her character.",1
"literally like there‚Äôs no poc rep they‚Äôre all paper white‚Ä¶game starts to feel grindy and chore-like in the endgame because there‚Äôs nothing to do except for abyss (hard enemies on a time limit to defeat). great graphics and story, detail is amazing too, but everything is behind paywalls. sure, you can play F2P, but what about when your resin reaches 0? You cant do anything then. You did all of your dailies? All of your quests? Finished the event? Those are your primogems (currency used for gambling and ‚Äúenergy‚Äù refills) for the day. come back tomorrow for 60 more. 160 is an entire pull, usually an insignificant weapon. 

i have spent hours and hours on this game, it being my hyperfixation for a while. ‚âà$50 USD spent. AR 56. Been playing since 1.2. Have an endora to prove it. 

If you want a casual gacha game with a lot of story and collectibles, this is great! If you ignore the crap company too. And the lack of representation. And the greediness. And the lack of accessibility for F2P. so much more.",1
"hello hoyoverse, and genshin character designers,

I and probably many more people have noticed something off. Leakers have leaked some of the upcoming sumeru characters. I know you have based it off of south Asia but i do not see ANY dark skinned character. Only Dehya but she isn‚Äôt even that dark. I am dissatisfied and disappointed. If you want to make it based of a real life place than make it ACCURATE!! The way you made Yunjin character correctly, i‚Äôm sure you can do it with sumeru characters. Dark skinned people need more representation. There is so much white washing. Also Doris outfit is very stereotyping, orientalist, and very offensive. Sumeru characters  are all a big flop, even though i don‚Äôt play as much now when i saw the leaks my jaw literally DROPPED(in a negative way) THEY ARE LITERALLY PALER THAN WHITE DADS! I know south asia people COULD BE white but why is only one of them darker toned?? you could atleast try to make them tan. if cyno is whiter than my white crust dog i‚Äôll literally EXPLODE",1
Honestly I enjoy this game. But this game has a bit much going on. It‚Äôs not even fun. Like I don‚Äôt even bother doing commissions anymore. I‚Äôve lost fun in this game but this game was very fun in the beginning the only thing that I‚Äôm hanging on for is Klee. So if genshin impact could make this game any more fun. I would enjoy it a lot more. To overall say to this game is take your time. It‚Äôs much better being a beginner than a late-game player. You have so much more to do and have fun. I‚Äôm not calling anyone lazy. I just think that it could be more fun if we could have some more fun stuff to do for the late game players. And the amount of storage is horrible. But you can‚Äôt control that but that‚Äôs all.,5
"Honestly this game is incredible and I made my friends mad with it so many times, all I could ever ask for! But you don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve downloaded this and uninstalled on my phone, it takes up about 10 GB of space. Also the purchase system has a few problems in my opinion. It‚Äôs smart that you can only order things from the device you created your account on but I feel like it can get in the way or become a huge problem for people with devices that don‚Äôt work anymore. I purchased some things because I was desperate for Rosaria but I had to redownload it to do anything like that and if I didn‚Äôt have that space it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Overall, great game with minor inconveniences.",4
"Hello! Just saying that the gameplay is awesome the character designs are really amazing really awesome the graphics are really good. I really like how there commissions and the different places to go to, But I can‚Äôt experience that anymore because my device broke so I had to get a new one but I‚Äôm really missing out in the Inazuma spots and character trials, although it was fun while it lasted!. But I sometimes think about getting the game again and I want to right now but I can‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt have storage space. So thank you for creating the game I really enjoyed it . Hope to play it soon or today or whenever I don‚Äôt mind I just thank you for making my life better with this game.<3",5
"Genshin Impact is one of the best games out there! Sure, it does have a few minor problems but it is generally a very wonderful game! The fact that this game is free to download and has such beautiful gameplay and scenery is almost unbelievable. The character designs are gorgeous and the stories are so well thought-out and fun to play through! I love playing with my friends and fighting bosses together while we explore Inazuma. Of course, I‚Äôve been frustrated with this game before losing two 50/50‚Äôs and not getting good artifacts, but would the game really be fun without those challenges? I think they are what make the game fun and when you do get the character or artifact you want, you feel better :)",5
"Been playing this game since release and loved everything about it. Obviously as time went by a lot of players, including myself, have gotten bored by the lack of content but a lot of us still stayed and supported the game. Fast forward now, it is 1 year anniversary for this game and we are given 40 primos as a reward from a web event‚Ä¶ only 120 more primos for a single wish!!! It‚Äôs laughable, I‚Äôve played other gacha games that offer more than this and they have received less recognition of whatever Genshin has had. It‚Äôs sad that the company decides to deafen users who complain about the rewards and such. And I know there are people out there that believe mihoyo is doing a good job, however, majority believe that they are lacking in several areas. Please be kind to your community mihoyo, and as for me I‚Äôll be back when something cool happens in your game again, whenever that happens‚Ä¶.",1
"First time leaving a review because I‚Äôm frustrated to a point that I want to delete the game even though I spent quite a lot of money on this game already. The game itself is pretty good, but their customer support is beyond horrible. The game is supposed to work on multiple platforms which includes PC, PlayStation, and iOS devises. However, a simple task such as unlinking your PSN account is nearly impossible (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm having problem with) because first of all, you have to email them in a specific format. If you are lucky enough, they will send you an automated email which requires you to fill out all the information, but that‚Äôs not the end, after you submit it, they don‚Äôt respond to your request at all! I‚Äôm so freaking disappointed at their customer support. It feels like they are a company that only wants to make money through in app purchase and don‚Äôt care about anything else!",1
"I‚Äôve been playing for a month or two now and I love this game! I used to play on mobile and it felt almost impossible to do anything with the controls! As soon as I got a good enough computer I switched. but I know some people here might not be able to do that. I never had a problem with it crashing, and dialogue skipping. I really think they should make it easier to play on a phone/tablet by adding a controller. (I am not up to date with the mobile version if there is already a controller) I will not be giving this a one star review. it is still an absolutely amazing game, and I would suggest it to anyone who has enough space in their electronic. People still need to remember this game is still in the making, and came out a little bit ago in 2020.",4
"Have several months experience playing on mobile since launch. Runs alright on iPhone 10x but after a short amount of time it gradually heats up to the point of almost burning the hands IRL even on poor settings. As well as draining battery rapidly it also takes a lot of storage and will definitely take up more as areas are released. 

For a Mobile Game (or gacha, for that matter) it requires a lot of time to farm materials or do dailies/weeklies as there is no way to auto stages or teleport straight to dailies. You also constantly switch host instances to farm. Gacha has good pity but actually getting rolls is a real chore and devs are stingy with rolls such as Anniversary having pitiful rewards.

The game has good gameplay and interesting characters but from a technical point and as a mobile game it has shortcomings that made me have to drop it until I get a proper PC.",2
"The game is so beautiful. The graphics are amazing and the music is insanely good for a game. There are a lot of quests and places to explore when you start the game, but once you get to a higher rank, there isn‚Äôt a lot to do. I am adventure rank 58 right now and have had 100% exploration since adventure rank 57. I also have no more quests to do and wait tediously for new regions and characters to be released. I often get bored and stop playing for a while because there is nothing to do, but I always come back when a new region/character is released. I also want to mention that the game takes up about 29GB of my 60GB storage, so there isn‚Äôt a lot of other stuff I can do on my phone.",4
"I‚Äôm just now trying to download it on the phone. It requires a high-quality device and a lot of storage, but that is because of how much content is included for free. I see most of the reviews complain about how expensive 5-star characters are. Not trying to be rude, but since it‚Äôs a free game that‚Äôs their sole source of income... I‚Äôm not sure what you expected, they don‚Äôt keep updating this game to please players, they do it for money because they‚Äôre a profit organization.. and also, they‚Äôre 5-STAR. That means rare - rare means hard-to-get. Not sure why you guys expect everything about the game to be easy and flawless, such as bugs with loading and not having a good enough device to play. This sounds mean, but really.. you guys are a bit harsh lol",5
"I love this game and the graphics. I don‚Äôt mind some of the bugs and they seem to be ironing those out more and more. 

I even so far don‚Äôt mind how much of a grind leveling is because it‚Äôs sort of fun, but I think like other reviews the pay to win aspect will come out the longer it‚Äôs played. I also would rather monetization focus on customizing, skins, clothes, avatar hair options and how you look, and open up a little more of the nice weapons and characters drops from wishing. 

My largest issue isn‚Äôt one everyone would share, and I think I might even get made fun of for how I feel about it, but I wish in the story I wouldn‚Äôt be forced to ‚Äúworship‚Äù the statues in order to progress. Maybe it‚Äôs just the wording. I don‚Äôt mind leaving orbs but I don‚Äôt like being forced to participate in a game religion even if the game is focused on it. I didn‚Äôt have an issue with the story at all until I realized leveling the statues requires ‚Äúworshipping‚Äù them and that‚Äôs not ok with me. 

I might stop playing entirely because of that but will see if I can still progress if I choose not to do that part. 

Suggestion: change the words from ‚Äúworship‚Äù to ‚Äúleave an offering‚Äù 

I think that would help a little to be honest, and might help other people like me be more interested in the game.",3
"Only been playing 24 hours, but this game plays like final fantasy on psp, or Zelda on the switch...I love the elements and how they all react together in this game, whether it be environmental or during combat, makes for customizable fighting styles and various team set ups to keep combat interesting!The puzzles are seemingly easy so far but I expect them to get more complicated as the game escalates. Complete open world, wish there were more side quests early game to level quicker as I just hit level 15 I was able to ascend some characters but I was stuck at 13 with max capped characters pre ascension (lvl 20). Overall pretty decent story line and great feel with mobility and gliding and climbing. Definitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre looking for a mobile rpg",5
"I am only putting this at five stars so people can see this. I am currently on iPad and when I first started the game the cutscene was extremely glitchy and I couldn‚Äôt see what twin I was picking, then the whole sky and water was completely black and when I tried to swim in the water or a mob came around me there was a glow that was so freaking bright that I had to turn my brightness down almost all the way in order to actually see a tiny bit. Many other people have been having this problem and the creators have not responded to anyone or found a solution. Please fix this, I‚Äôm tired of waiting and uninstalling and reinstalling and making new accounts on this game just for everything to stay the same.",5
"It‚Äôs okay, and the story was getting really good, but once you‚Äôre high ar it gets boring and there‚Äôs nothing to do, it‚Äôs really hard to obtain primogems f2p, and there‚Äôs too much fan service and the story is going down hill. It‚Äôs not about the traveler finding their brother anymore, I think the last actually good quest was ‚ÄúWe Will Be Reuinited.‚Äù  Now, inazuma is cool and all, but the raiden shogun had so much potential but they decided to make her an ‚Äúuwu kawaii waifu‚Äù (ew) to get more pulls. I don‚Äôt really care about new events or new characters or new map expansions, (which is only happening in inazuma right now,) I just want more archon quests that actually follow the storyline how it‚Äôs supposed to be, and that actually make sense. This game has so much potential but fan service ruins it, not gonna lie.",4
"I started Genshin April of 2022, and i'm still playing. I went on vacation for a while and deleted it because i never played but I got it back in June. I have seen some people that have completed what's available, luckily I'm not that far yet. I came back just in time for the Sumeru region and i wasn't even done in Liyue so I still had a lot to do. Since then I've finished Inazuma and am now moving to Sumeru. My only complaint is sometimes my AR was to low to progress the story so I did a lot of grinding wich got boring. But i got past it and it's all good again. There are daily commissions to help leveling and tons of world quest that bridge the AR gap I try to save them for when Im stuck or bored.",5
"I felt compelled to write a review after my experience with the ‚ÄúCake for Traveler‚Äù birthday cake award. I missed the login on that day (not unheard of for someone to be busy with family on their birthday) and now I don‚Äôt get an exclusive cake for that whole year. Contacted customer support and they proceeded to basically belittle me with emojis in their response and basically ‚Äúlet this be a lesson to login everyday traveler‚Ä¶.‚Äù Blah blah‚Ä¶.

I understand I‚Äôm not going to get the cake but to make me feel even worse with their response didn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve been supporting this game for 2 years now, despite their horrible 1st anniversary reward.

Basically this game has beautiful music, beautiful story, but it‚Äôs bittersweet because it‚Äôs ran by an extremely greedy, predatory company that doesn‚Äôt care about it‚Äôs players. I‚Äôve played many gacha games and if it wasn‚Äôt for this game‚Äôs story, I would have done myself a favor and left it a long time ago.",1
"Game is great in all but soon after i got hacked and i've been contacting costumer service for almost 5 months now and i still cant get my acc back due to there not being enough proof its mine im trying everything i can but everytime i sumbit one it takes over a month i tried the quickest way and they still do not work please hire people for costumer service so people can get help and get there accs back ive spent 300 dollars on this game and would appreciate if you could please help me get it back i cannot go another week without it.. I cant handle seeing my own account being active everyday ive tried for days, weeks and months and still havent gotten it back so please fix this..",5
"my friend that has been playing genshin since it‚Äôs 1st release starting telling me about it, at first I found this really annoying but I kinda ignored her. after a few weeks she mentions it again and I decide to download it, a few months later. I play everyday, the story has me locked and I‚Äôve just been much happier. only downside is as the game is growing (and improving) it becomes harder for mobile players, but I know you guys know this and are working on it, so thank you. tbh I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but this game is so incredible that it‚Äôs needed. thanks 4 all ur game has done 4 me! <33 (also if u don‚Äôt have this game downloaded then do it rn and u won‚Äôt regret up it, ur storage might tho)",5
"I know you probably won‚Äôt see this but your community deserves so much better than just 10 intertwined fates. What about the people who have been supporting your game since launch? What about the people who spend money on the game? What about the Free to play players that don‚Äôt get rewards to much the game lacks Content, Without content well are much players gonna play? Also, Gacha rate up is still terrible Your community is disappointed don‚Äôt think you can get away with this I seen games that are much better than this disappointment. WE DESERVE BETTER REWARDS BETTER CONTENT AND BETTER RATE UP honestly seeing how ur loosing a lot of players I don‚Äôt think it will take a while for this game to fall.",5
"I very much love the idea of this game, however I feel like there are so many pointless events and updates instead of continuing the actual story. The game takes up so much storage that somewhere in between the release of Sumeru and Fontaine, Genshin Impact is going to lose a very large amount of players due to the amount of storage this game is because of random events that have nothing to do with the main story. Another problem, and this one is just my personal opinion, is that Ei‚Äôs story quest was really bad. She should‚Äôve went around trying to right her wrongs and apologize to her people rather than taking pictures and buying food with the Traveler. The graphics and main idea of the game are quite amazing though, but with the way this game is being made, it will probably lose like half of it‚Äôs players by the time it‚Äôs complete.",2
"The game is literally 12 and up on the App Store. I started playing this game when I was 13, and I was heavily addicted. At first, I thought this game was cute and really well made for a mobile app. But quickly, I fell down a slippery slope of spending mostly all my allowance on this game. I would spend at least 50 bucks on each banner. It wasn‚Äôt healthy, and before long it ruined my mental health. I couldn‚Äôt take breaks from the game, because if I did I would miss out on a bunch of content. Again, I was only 13 this was quite literally an addiction. This game should at least be 18 plus, at the end of the day it‚Äôs a form of gambling. I would get sort of a rush from wishing, then when I actually got the character I wanted, I would feel empty. Then I would do it again for almost every banner. Miyoho should be more upfront about this instead of letting minors basically gain gambling addictions.",1
"Genshin impact is great game but the way it‚Äôs handled can be really bad, mihoyo already had two big scandals in less than 2 months, first not letting the character that have sold the most work with a really great support that its already in game and even giving fake advertising of a character to then just change it based on a ‚Äútranslation error‚Äù and second after 1 year making billions the anniversary rewards and just nonexistent just 10 wishes when it takes 75-90 wishes to get a 5* and running some art/cosplaying event for $5 dollars price, i don't think a cosplay is worth just $5. Mostly every gacha have really good rewards for anniversary, Genshin is not one of those. The game is really good until you get to the point you run out of content and i would advise to not spend a single dollar on it just be a F2P and you will have more fun and you wont feel as robbed.",2
"everything about genshin impact is just a solid 10/10. but, when it comes to quests, it can make you almost uninstall the game.
what quest am i talking about?
the trails of tianqiu valley quest. the fact that you're stuck in singleplayer until you defeat it has made SO MANY players (including me) furious. most people were about to just restart their game, trade accs, etc. it's almost impossible. many people just want it removed or atleast let you have access to co-op mode (like with the lost book quest or the guili plains quest). the main problem is the tower to the left. it's easy when you're 5 levels higher than the opponents, but on world level 5,,,, it's almost impossible.",5
"There have been numerous problems stated by the Genshin community such as, the fishing system, and the anniversary rewards, although I do debate that the fishing system is moreover a new mechanic to the game, and should be taken granted the fact it could be improved, although I do agree with the anniversary rewards, it could use a bit more generosity, the best idea for me is a free standard five star weapon and character, I also debate that genshin is still worth playing but needs improvement, I argue about the designs and storytelling of genshin, designs and storytelling that moreover aren‚Äôt creative, repetitive, and sexual, I also believe that the cutscenes should improve, they should balance their over-all difficulty, and add different and diverse mechanics to keep the flow of interest going, for now I have rated this game three stars.",3
"The game is beautiful; combat, reactions, quest, they‚Äôre all intricate and fun BUT, mihoyo. Has been neglecting its game and it‚Äôs communities voice. MILLIONS of people are fed up with their FIRST anniversary. The lack of buffs to seriously highly underused characters, the resin system being unbearable making it difficult to even play the game for extensive periods(this is heavily in-forced and inflated once you hit AR30-35 where it starts to pick up and become insane exp and the amount of you get from domains and how much resin they consume making it rapidly difficult). For example some who is AR55, it‚Äôll take them several MONTHS of daily grinding and using all your resin and fragile resin to progress to the next level. This is literally how ABYSMAL things are. Mihoyo you guys need to make changes asap or you‚Äôre going to lose hundreds of millions. And if your new.. I wouldn‚Äôt advise getting to invested into this game until they start doing some much needed changes",1
"I want to make this clear, I gave the game 3 stars not because it‚Äôs a bad game, not because it‚Äôs boring, not because it‚Äôs bad in general. I gave this game 3 stars because of the constant crashing and lag I have. I seem to have only about 5 minutes of time before the game crashes and I have to start whatever it is I was doing again. It‚Äôs an amazing game with an amazing story and stunning graphics, and don‚Äôt get me started on the amazing character design. And I know that I am not the only person like this. Some people just can‚Äôt afford to buy new laptops or new phones. So I‚Äôm really hoping that this coach bug can be fixed. Other than those problems, I would have given this game a 5 star rating.",5
So basically I only have 5 gigabytes to use and I only have 2 apps. I saw this and thought it looked like a great game! And it is really fun. But later when I joined back it said I needed to upgrade to ‚Äúfull version‚Äù so I tapped it and ever since it keeps saying to delete a lot of storage. I have deleted half of my photos and messages but nothing changes. I am really upset because I want to keep playing but I can‚Äôt. Please fix this PLEASEEEEEE( I‚Äôll rate you 4 stars until you fix this then get a 5!) pls fix this. I really want to play this game! It is so fun.. üò©üò© the only reason I rated this 4 is because I can‚Äôt even PLAY the game!! Ughh ‚òπÔ∏èI wish I could upgrade my storage but I don‚Äôt have enough money for that.. my job barley pays me. Please üôè,4
"So I know that to have the best game performance is to have an iPhone 8 plus and up, but I know that you can do better, Maybe allow Settings to tweak in the game performance as in Low, Medium, and high quality and how much FPS its being used as in now, I think that would be a great idea for other people with other mobile devices to enjoy the game without experimenting any other sorts of Game errors.
Last but not least this might of not come but its just a suggestion to let Xbox and MacOs Players be able to play this game as well, I think it would be very fun for other people to be able to play with friends with different cross-play platforms.
Over all this is a great game and I love so much.",5
"This game is the best and overall mid however, it just makes me mad sometimes I hate how we have to update everytime‚Ä¶ But I also know that new characters and new stories are up-coming every single time! I am so excited!!! But I am also mad as I looked and saw that if you get to AR 60 you get nothing but one wish from the standard banner not even a 10 pull wish. You basically get nothing when you put your mind to the game it‚Äôs just so stupid‚Ä¶ You get into the game and when you reach AR 60 it just falls apart it‚Äôs genuinely crazy. This game is a rip off when you reach AR 60 but also it‚Äôs kind of fun pulling for characters and getting your favorite characters, I‚Äôm not trying to say that it‚Äôs awful but it‚Äôs mid-between the rate of 5-3 rating.",4
"Okay so where do I start. This is by far one of the most beautiful games I‚Äôve ever seen on mobile. The graphics are gorgeous and the scenery and vast expanse of world exploration is amazing. The freedom to move and explore is unmatched compared to most available games on mobile. You can even play it on console and pc, the cross-play feature is amazing and allows me to play with all of my friends again. Now my favorite part I have to say though is the gorgeous story outline I‚Äôve seen thus far and I‚Äôm only a rank 21 as I write this. 

But I have to say. The reason that brings me here to begin with. The reason I didn‚Äôt rate the game five stars. As ai traveled through the beautiful city of Mondstadt, I saw this gorgeous black and white Labrador like dog. It was jumping around and playing and dancing, and I couldn‚Äôt help but stop and watch as it walked up to my character and sat down staring up at me. 

Only. For. Me. NOT TO BE ABLE TO PET IT!!!! This is bull and I demand to be able to pet the bestest boi!!!! 

To summarize... I would like to be able to pet the dog. Please add this. 

P.S 

I really love the game! And I appreciate everything y‚Äôall do. Thank you for your time.",4
"Please note that this is a review specifically for the iOS version of Genshin Impact. I usually play on PC via Epic Games and absolutely love it (I‚Äôd rate 4.5ish). I decided to clear out the 3.5ish gigs on my iPhone to download Genshin here so I could play when I can‚Äôt use my PC. However, what they fail to mention anywhere that I can see is that the iOS version is a demo. After downloading and playing through the very limited amount of content, you must additionally download over 15GB of additional content to continue playing. This prevents me from using the app, as I am at AR45 and have long since played through all of the demo content available, and I cannot afford to sacrifice 1/4 of my phone‚Äôs storage to a game I already play on another platform. As a side note, while in the LOADING SCREEN, my phone heated up quite a bit, which is extremely unusual for it.",2
i played on my account every single day for years i used every resin i could find on my account i bought welkin moons every month i loved this game but randomly i got signed out and i can‚Äôt log in i tried every possible way to get in even redownloading the game with took hours with my slow internet i just spent 100$ on genesis crystals then the next day i can‚Äôt log in i reached out to hoyoverse then they just randomly stop sending messages back i have no idea what happened to my account but i see my account is being played i haven‚Äôt been on my account for a week and it says last played is a day somebody took my account and hoyoverse doesn‚Äôt wanna do anything i give up i regret playing this game i loved it and now i see the true colors of it i don‚Äôt recommend this game it was definitely fun 5 stars on that but how can someone play a game for years just for it to be gone in a single day and have no one help him i even offered to show my last 4 digits of my credit card for my purchases and i have videos of me playing on it what more could you want i hate this game forever i don‚Äôt even know why i can‚Äôt log in but whatever the reason is it is not at all fair to just not let me log in after spending money i saved up 1/10 don‚Äôt spent money on this game if you wanna play.,1
"I have started playing genshin last year in July and I absolutely love it. The characters, backgrounds of the characters are all amazing! Hoyoverse holds a special place in my heart (not because I spent a lot of money on the game) because it‚Äôs probably the best 11.1 gigabytes I have ever spent on my phoneüòÖ.
I cannot wait for sacramoche and nilou to be released in the later versions of genshin impact. The almost 2 years I have been playing genshin has been the best years I will ever spend on my phone all day and all year :D. 
Other than the off topic things it‚Äôs a really great game and hardly ever lags! For people who like a bit of rpg, combat, and fantasy games this is literally the perfect game everüòÅüòÅ",5
"I have tried many times to use this game as an escape for reality and a fun fantasy adventure, but the lack of representation in the models truly astounds me. Dark skin is not represented nearly enough in any of the characters or regions. I am under the impression that the pyro nation to be introduced later in the game is supposed to represent indigenous Americans (my people) and from the comic involving Vennessa we have seen that they are‚Ä¶ almost all pale and redheaded? The Sumeru region that is coming to the game soon, supposedly taking influence from South Asian and North African cultures, has been represented by NPC characters who share the same extremely pale skintone as 99% of the rest of the characters. I fear that this problem I have with the game will only get worse as more updates are released. I and many others who feel misrepresented by this game will not continue to play it if this keeps up in the future.",1
Genshin impact it‚Äôs a cool game you look at it and you think it‚Äôs beautiful you can see the scenery and you can see the difference of the lands the characters and their powers are amazing enough plotline better than I expected butter a few bags but those things do not go into the control of the game like the one by climber for why you can climb down and climb on the floor but the only people that use that I can‚Äôt be used for bad really just a funny joke but there‚Äôs not many bugs just a slow way points when you‚Äôre on mobile but on computer and Other devices it‚Äôs amazing I recommend this game to anyone that‚Äôs trying to find a good RPG game and trying to find a fantasy with a good plotline,5
So today I was trying to go into genshin because of the update and it wasn‚Äôt working correctly basically instead of being full screen the actual screen was like a small box in the middle and so I decided to try and close out of it and reopen it that didn‚Äôt work so I restarted my laptop that didn‚Äôt work so I was going to redownload it and when I uninstalled it and went to redownload it it said 502 error and I've tried many times today to redownload genshin and it is still not working. So I just wanted to let you know that there might be a problem with the site or something maybe.,5
"The anniversary rewards only made the end game players quit. As an AR57 at the moment, I was actually looking forward for the rewards but the rewards ended up trash. Even the lantern rite event rewards are better than this whatever ‚Äúanniversary‚Äù rewards you call it.

There‚Äôs also nothing to do as an end game player. Most people just log on, do resins, dailies, and log off. And this repeats everyday for most end game players. I‚Äôve been repeating this cycle for more than 4 months now and I‚Äôm extremely burnt out. There‚Äôs barely any content and barely anything to do when you‚Äôre at the end game stage. Even the story quests seems extremely rushed on the 2.1 update. 

As a player that started playing two days after the release, this game is starting to go downhill. It‚Äôs not even that bad to just give us better rewards, especially when there are low spenders and f2p players struggling to keep saving.",1
"The game has so much potential but it‚Äôs just a gacha game they don‚Äôt care about anything but you paying them. The resin system holds you back from playing and makes co-op play practically useless. The rate on characters is super low so even if they give away 50 wishes good luck getting anything useful. Honestly I would love the game if it was an actual game and not a cash grab. You‚Äôll log in do your dailies maybe use your resin if you still even care at this point and then log off. Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt spend any money on this game because it‚Äôs basically just gambling with a very low chance of winning and the ‚Äúendgame‚Äù is highly dependent on you having good option of characters and a lot of resin spent which you only get so much per day after that you have to pay to play more basically, once resin is gone the game is just running around attacking random enemies.",2
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game and how‚Äôs it‚Äôs free to play! It‚Äôs just that the developers seem to be biased on the boys customers who played the game.. it‚Äôs almost like the girl twin options is just a physical looks. If you gonna make us have an options to flirt with the characters then make it both way, there‚Äôs literally a whole quest on pleasing Lisa. I‚Äôm a girl so it‚Äôs quiet uncomfortable having to complete quests where I have to please Lisa and clearly are flirting with her meanwhile both the twin look like a minor and Lisa look like she can be their mom.. I have tried out a lot of games and always experienced this, I thought Genshin Impact were different because of how well made it is. So pleaseeee, make it so that when we choose the girl twin, the story change a slight bit to fit the gender or something.",4
"Hello to the devs, im enjoying the game quite a lot. You made a really neat world and im happy that im able to be in it as lumine :D
However, i would like to acknowledge this issue:
im in the middle of a world quest and I. JUST. CANT. CLEAR IT.
that in itself would be fine, but unfortunately i cant enter co op mode and farm materials for my talents now. This is so annoying im considering quitting the game. I googled the problem and many other people were experiencing frustration as well. In my opinion, this could even force players to avoid world quests. If you fixed the system so that players could enter co op mode in domains even in the middle of a world quest, that would be amazing and remove a huge stressor from the game. Thank you.",5
I really love this game I stayed up until 4:00 am playing it. The characters are really fun to interact with and they have a lot of personality. The world is very big and there‚Äôs always a new thing around every corner.  But I have one problem and please developers see this this. My one very important problem is that you can‚Äôt interact with the animals other then killing them and the wild animals are fine but the dogs and cats in cities. The fact that can‚Äôt pet them or play with them is painful. Like there just sitting there being all cute and stuff and I you can do is watch how cute their being. PLEASE make it so we can pet them. Other then that the game is awesome and I love very minute of it.,5
"I'm not going to lie, I'm always skeptical of free games like this because there tends to be the 'pay to win' kind of feel with them. However, I'm AR 30 and I haven't had to make a single purchase to get everything. I've been able to earn everything through the resources given. 

However, even though the graphics, game style, and story are amazing, the bugs are getting worse. I understand the game is only in 1.2 right now, but the bugs started increasing after the event update for Albedo. When I first downloaded it, I never had any issues, but now it seems to be crashing every 10-15 minutes and it's annoying having to reload. If these bugs can be fixed, that would be great!",5
"I love Genshin so much. I‚Äôm absolutely addicted, the open world is beautiful with so much to explore and plenty of secrets to find. The graphics are just gorgeous as well, but there is one problem that I have noticed a few others have had like me, crashing, I‚Äôve tried to delete the game and then re-download, but that didn‚Äôt seem to fix the problem. I even restarted my phone for good measures, sadly that didn‚Äôt help either. The only thing I could think of that could be causing this is something within the game or my phone itself; though it should run well enough on a iPhone 7 Plus I would think, in any case if it is the game I hope it gets patched soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"This game is overall amazing. The quality is incredible, the shading, the art, the voice acting, the storyline, everything is amazing! And while this game is really great, anytime there‚Äôs a cut scene where you see something happening‚Äîlike the very beginning for example, the noises and visuals get all fuzzy, but nothing else does this. It is a new game so I understand there will be some minor issues, but whenever the devs. Can fix this, I think the game will be so much more pleasant. Another thing, this is just a suggestion, but when you‚Äôre actually playing as the character, maybe add the sky and water. It‚Äôs just black and that‚Äôs slightly irritating, but it can be played without. Anyways, great game overall!",5
"This game is so hard but fun at the same time. I‚Äôm sad knowing that I‚Äôm slowly growing away from it. All I wanted was to just play the game and have fun with it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but, I‚Äôm loosing interest. Every time someone would ask me what I‚Äôm playing, I‚Äôd say Genshin Impact and start talking abt it so happily. This game is just starting to become even harder and harder for me to handle. Back then, as soon as a figured abt Hu Tao, she had my hopes up every time I wished not knowing that u can‚Äôt get a character that is not on the banner, but now I have Hu Tao. Genshin really has a place in my heart and I will never give up on it. I play Project Sekai like how I used to play Genshin. Genshin Impact, is still and will always be my favorite game.       Bye",5
"Hello, I‚Äôm playing on my iPad and downloaded the full version and when I loaded this game I see that the water is black and whenever I see an enemy or I get wet or damaged I just see white for a few seconds, I am also surrounded by a black cover circling around me, when I progresses farther in the game it was still the problem, them I encounter the dragon in the city and I couldn‚Äôt even see it I was in the dark. After I somehow managed to delete the dragon, I was in darkness I couldn‚Äôt see anything in front of me so the game was unplayable. I tried restarting my device, deleting the app the then downloading it again and login in again but I still in the dark. I even went as far to deleting the account and making a new one but I was still surrounded. Just to remind you I downloaded the full version of the game.",3
"I love this game, it keeps me so entertained but there are little things about it that annoys me sometimes, like I just downloaded the game so I think along with my character I only have Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa, and I only got to level 8 so it made me fight a level 20 monster and all of my characters died in the fight, so I revived them and when they revived I was put at the temple of the lion. And my characters had very low health so I tried to feed them but it wouldn‚Äôt let me. It said that I could only feed fallen characters when they had less than half health. And when I read the temple details it tried to make me fight LEVEL 20 HILICHURILS 
I don‚Äôt know what you can do about this but the game is just a bit too hard‚Ä¶.",4
"I love this game. The quality and all the little details and the details of the characters it‚Äôs beautiful! , the nations , everything! There‚Äôs only one thing I‚Äôd like to say. I‚Äôm currently in AR30 and it gets rough. Its very stressful and I try my best to defeat but it‚Äôs too hard to handle and this game has given me a lot of stress but also happiness , for example: the story quests, the hole entire map and defeating things that I thought I‚Äôd never complete. But if Genshin impact would make it a bit more easier for people that are starting Genshin impact , I‚Äôd really appreciate it because I don‚Äôt like having stress on me but I still try because it‚Äôs such a interesting and beautiful game . But this is all I have to say! I hope you guys read this!",4
"This game has beautiful graphics and amazing gameplay but there‚Äôs a thing that‚Äôs been happening lately‚Ä¶
Genshin would have to redownload as in a update even when there isn‚Äôt and when I try to ‚Äúupdate it‚Äù it downloads half way then cancels! And I have purchased the Welkin so I haven‚Äôt been able to claim it for 4 DAYS NOW and lost primogems and missed ends of events, starts of them, etc so I am unable to play Genshin Impact right now and it‚Äôs frustrating me a lot but I have no idea how to fix it and I have to go to my friends house (which I don‚Äôt go often and is kinda far away) to redownload it and one time it was for a WEEK so Hoyoverse if it‚Äôs just some glitch please fix it if you can thank you.",4
So I am confused with the characters on trial. I already got the librarian but when I was doing a quest it showed she was on trial. Same with Kaeya. I was playing a quest and it said he was on trial. So uh.. üòê üôÑ yeah idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But other than that I also am not sure how to get the characters that are part of the event right now. But I really want the dog kind of person. The one guy that looks like he is dog themed. Anyways‚Ä¶ this game is great! You should totally check it out anyone reading this. I saw the YouTuber CookieSwirlC playing this ikr! So download the game it has great graphics good animation and quality. I love it! It is games like this that keep someone going. Just the first part is enough to hook someone. Smile for me! üòÉ,5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love Genshin Impact! There‚Äôs just something that‚Äôs bothering me. When I downloaded the game it said if i wanted to fully download the game and I clicked ‚ÄúRemind me later‚Äù. Well later on where you were talking to Lisa, Jean, and Kaeya, it gave me a quest and a pop up showed up. It said I had insufficient storage. I cleared out more than 100 photos, updated my device, and tried everything that would get me more storage. When I looked up how to fix this it said to go to settings, go to Genshin Impact, and then click ‚ÄúClear cache and data‚Äù. Well I suppose it‚Äôs only for Androids because I have an Apple iPad and i never saw the clear button. Please fix this because I just downloaded this game today and now I can‚Äôt even play it.",4
While there‚Äôs a bit of lag I honestly don‚Äôt mind it (probably because I play with a ps5) the storyline is amazing with great graphics and I love how many side quests there are only problem is primogems to be more specific how hard it is to get them. An average achievement gives you 5 primogems it takes 1600 for the CHANCE to get a new character and yes I know you can get primos from quests but still. I don‚Äôt have enough money to just buy primos because their quite expensive. Also the majority of the time I‚Äôll spend so much time getting enough primos just to not get a character like seriously I literally only have 2 different 5 star characters and I‚Äôve been playing for at least 6 months. aside from that I do enjoy the game.,4
"Look - I love this game, I‚Äôve been playing for over a year now maybe even two. But I cannot overlook the fact that the company is incredibly racist and colourist, and it shows in genshin. They refuse to add any representation for dark-skinned people. Their ‚Äúdark‚Äù characters are literally just the skin tone of a tan white person. Their German, Chinese, and Japanese characters are mostly all PAPER white. Like not even a regular white but ghostly. Like I don‚Äôt even think these skin tones exist in real life, I guess with the exception of sickly victorian children. They put so much effort into representing German, Chinese, and Japanese culture, but when it came to Sumeru, a nation based off South Asia and the Middle East, absolutely zero effort to accurately represent their culture. They have no respect for people of different races, and are extremely colourist. The only actually dark characters in the game are the ENEMIES and a few npc‚Äôs. This is unacceptable and disgusting. Do better hoyoverse.",1
"If you are going to represent different nations in your video game at least do it right. When it came to liyue which is based off of china you made sure to put your all into it but can‚Äôt manage to do minimal research on sumeru and jumbled south Asia,Southeast Asia, west Asia and North Africa into one huge mega country while also making a lot of the characters have inaccurate clothing for those regions or literally just orientalist designs which is the same mistakes Disney‚Äôs Aladdin made. Let‚Äôs not even mention how a good amount of sumeru is meant to represent India yet there are mostly people who look like they could pass for mondstadters there. Literally type in ‚ÄòIndian people‚Äô or ‚ÄòNorth Africans‚Äô into a search engine and you‚Äôll see a lot of them have tan to dark skin so making EVERYONE except for two characters white as snow is not only completely unrealistic but also says a lot about you as a company. Do better",1
"For context for those that dont know about the Sumeru situation:
A while ago (at the time of writing this) 5 new characters were leaked for the new region which is based off of EGYPT (keep that in mind). Out of these 5 characters, 4 of them were light-skinned. Normally that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, but considering that Sumeru is literally supposed to be based off of Egypt that‚Äôs ridiculous. There are currently a total of 2 playable characters currently in the game that have darker complexions. so far thats 3 counting the new character. Fans were hoping that we‚Äôd get more with the release of Sumeru and Natlan but it‚Äôs looking like that won‚Äôt be the case. So Hoyoverse, if you want the nations to be culturally accurate, ADD MORE DIVERSE CHARACTERS.

However, I understand why this happened. Unfortunately, colorism is still very rampant in our society, especially in Asian countries. It‚Äôs just unfortunate that even one of my favorite games isn‚Äôt an exception to this.",1
THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I started playing about 3 days ago and I‚Äôm in love with the characters and how fun it is to play with my friends!!! Me and my best friend were playing together just last night and we laughed so much because I kept lagging(I had bad WiFi last night) and I would just randomly fly across the screen or fly in the ground! My favorite characters to play are Yun Jin and Kaeya! They are amazing in battle! But Lisa is an amazing character to play as well! She can kill enemies fast! The graphics are also amazing and I love how the characters interact with each other! But one thing I found weird was that you have to be Adventure Rank 16 to play with other people,5
"this game literally could‚Äôve been top tier hoyo if you could at least listen to your fandom when we TELL you something important like how you guys made our ONLY black character xinyan a walking stereotype without even admitting that she‚Äôs black saying that she hates her skin color & that she‚Äôs ‚Äúscary‚Äù, 2nd Eula Lawrence who legitimately has slavery & racism in her background is just DISAPPOINTING. & y‚Äôall making carol HATE her skin color while WHITEWASHING her & XINYAN  Is just DISGUSTING. Especially the sumeru leaks, the AUDACITY to make them pale like paper but then BASE IT OFF OF PEOPLES CULTURE!! Seriously the LEAST you could do is make them brown, dark, OR tan because NOT all people from MIDDLE EAST ARE PALE WHITE!!! this is seriously so frustrating. & don‚Äôt talk about how it‚Äôs ‚ÄúChinese beauty Standards‚Äù because then you SHOULDNT be basing characters off peoples culture & not atleast make it look accurate. It‚Äôs like a never ending with y‚Äôall, you guys never learn & you just don‚Äôt care.",1
"Is hoyoverse scared of melanin or something? Why is 99% of all the characters the palest of pales? Make the characters from Sumeru have more diversity. The leaks for some of their character designs are super disappointing. Sumeru is based off of the SWANA area. The people from there should have darker skin. The only excusable exception is Collei, but even then she should have a tan from being outside all the time. For Inazuma and Liyue it‚Äôs obvious hoyoverse did research on how to properly represent the nations they‚Äôre based off of. Inazuma based on Japan and Liyue based on China. In order to give better representation hoyoverse NEEDS to do the same thing for Sumeru. Pick one country and heavily research it. The SWANA region is vast and diverse; hoyoverse will not be able to give representation as well to Sumeru in general because of this. If it takes longer for Sumeru to come out then so be it. Overall I‚Äôm not suprised how horribly Sumeru is being handled, but I am disappointed.",1
"This is definitely a game I spend far to much time on, be it doing simple tasks or completing quests. It‚Äôs not really Pay 2 win and with enough self control you can save up for characters you want. Sure you can pay to up your experience but it‚Äôa definitely not something you have to do. The monthly updates are nice and if you pace yourself you won‚Äôt get bored but even running through and getting everything done doesn‚Äôt mean that you have nothing to do. Exploring to 100% all areas, finding chests you might have missed, doing daily quests, farming for items (my over 1000 mint can testify). All in all it‚Äôs a fun game that I just never get tired of!",5
"Hi! I love genshin impact. It‚Äôs a beautiful game, with an amazing story and characters who have a lot of depth. Buuut.. you guys at mihoyo are kinda greedy. People spend hundreds of dollars on a banner, only to loose the 50/50 to qiqi, Jean, or Mona. I know you aren‚Äôt gonna care that thousands of players go into debt because of this. You don‚Äôt even pay attention to anyone‚Äôs suggestions if they don‚Äôt live in China. Also here‚Äôs a shoutout to everyone who keeps asking for characters in reviews: mihoyo doesn‚Äôt decide what characters you get. It‚Äôs completely random. Also, mihoyo some of your female characters are wearing really sexist outfits‚Ä¶ (Mona, Noelle) anyway I hope that someday mihoyo might be an actually decent, caring company (but we all know that‚Äôs never gonna happen) -a genshin fan",4
"Genshin is the best game I have ever played you have so many options it even tops roblox it‚Äôs funn the only problem is that it‚Äôs realy boring when you just farm for primos and it gets harder every adventure rank and building characters is to hard for me my sisters can easily become strong but I started the game way before them and there way stronger then me artifacts confuse me and I don‚Äôt know why my xiao only does 14k damage or 6k damage when everyone else‚Äôs do 22k to 30k damage I‚Äôm so sad I feel weak and I‚Äôm adventure rank 48 and I on
Y have 2 5 star characters it‚Äôs very hard to get 5 stars for em but my sisters have 12 or 13 a and there adventure rank 56 I want to give up now but I want ganyu or yae miko that‚Äôs it for now üò≠",5
"Honestly. This game is just so addicting and amazing. The storyline, the characters, the music, the scenery, the wishing system, the events. It‚Äôs just wow. I‚Äôm so surprised I haven‚Äôt found this game sooner. Though, I have one complaint. Not many people have a lot of storage on their devices and they desperately want to play Genshin as well. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, maybe you can continue with the storyline without using a lot of storage? Maybe split it up or something? I don‚Äôt know how it works but I hope you can fix this issue because, 17 GB? That‚Äôs way too much and only 3 regions (Monstadt, Liyue, Inazuma) have been out. But, keep up the amazing work and I hope all of you have a wonderful day/evening/night! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"This game is great. Has a great plot and great character designs. Even though it's free you will feel like you need to spend so much money on it 
If you are F2p there is a limit of chests. You might be playing for a long time and chests and events are the reason why you get to primogems but sometimes all the chests are gone and you can barely make primogems I suggest there is another system to earn primogems. Sure comms but let's be real we won't get the character we want from coms since they are normally out for 20+ days you need 3 and a half days to do a 1 pull. I have no idea for another way to get primogems but if you can please come up with another system to get them",5
"This is such an incredible game in general but to have the ability to use it as a mobile app is perfection. The amount of storage it takes up does seem daunting but it‚Äôs totally worth it, you‚Äôll fall in love instantly. Whether you play for the story line, to collect characters, to have amazing battles, to explore, or just to play casually this is the perfect game. It never rushes you and it really truly rewards it‚Äôs players for simply playing. There‚Äôs always something new to explore and the visuals are absolutely beautiful. It‚Äôs so fun to collect all of the characters and grow to be a strong player. Just 10/10 so much fun. Definitely something you could loose yourself in and play for hours!",5
"Genshin Impact has been an amazing game since release with stunning graphics on a cross platform game for mobile, PC, and later on Playstation. Music is amazing. I have been waiting for a game just like this to appear on mobile. I have spent a good amount of money and time on this game. I have started nearly a year ago.

I will give my opinion and thoughts on the situation in regards to the one year anniversary. Yes, people should have high expectations for rewards but don‚Äôt be going overboard with the complaining when it does not meet your expectations. I expected more but was not surprised and I am content with what we got plus the extras. 

Looking at other gacha games especially Honkai Impact, their one year anniversary rewards were underwhelming too. Each year did improve or get better so we can expect next year rewards to improve as well as going forward. 

Again Mihoyo keep up the good work in developing the game forward. Looking forward to the adventure in the other regions yet to be released. I hope to continue to be playing this game years down the road as I love all aspects of the game.",5
"The art work, the story, and the voice acting are all very engaging and well done. I‚Äôm so impressed with this game considering it‚Äôs free. Even if you catch up with the story you never run out of things to do, there are always extra events going on as well as daily commissions. Not to mention grinding for artifacts and ascension materials T.T You can certainly get great characters and weapons without spending money, the free 4-star weapons are really good especially if you remember to level them up! Great game, but be weary if the fandom. There‚Äôs a lot of children who through tantrums when they don‚Äôt get their way. I try not to engage too much and just enjoy the game for what it is.",5
"i absolutely love this game! the controls are straightforward and easy to use, and the scenery and music alone are absolutely stunning! good music is a MUST in games i play because i love music, and this one definitely takes the cake. it‚Äôs so fun to play, too! i‚Äôve played for hours at a time.

the only issue i have is that it takes a REALLY long time to get through to the next story quest. once i‚Äôve finished one chapter, i sometimes have to get to an adventure rank 5 levels higher which is really hard to do sometimes and i lose motivation quickly. thats my only gripe. i adore this game otherwise! it‚Äôs fun to play with friends, too, and all the seasonal events and stuff are really creative and nice. thank you for blessing us with this game, mihoyo! üòç",4
"So I started playing Genshin like early Eula banner and now I‚Äôm all the way at AR52, this game is EXACTLY what I needed. Lemme just lift off some of the basics *co op (but like good co op) *grinding (like you can grind and it actually gets you somewhere) *character design (I wish I could dress like that) *story (like better than any book or movie I‚Äôve seen) Anyways this game is just so amazing. I especially like the co op cuz first off you can fight a giant rock lizard with banging music and with friends. And I love healing and being support and this game fuels that need. Anyways I‚Äôm mostly putting this here to boost the rating cuz people are mad at the anniversary which I don‚Äôt agree with. And I like writing reviews so yeah",5
"As a game depending on new story elements, Genshin could do well to focus on complementing each game chapter with actual effort put into its banners, a lottery system that updates with desirable characters related to the story. Instead, the developers at miHoYo put out very slim percentages for the chance to actually get those characters. In addition, they keep railroading its community engagement through forced PR narratives that do not address players‚Äô concerns with actual content and gameplay quality issues, instead preferring to talk only about its shiny new content that does not address the underlying concerns. Lastly, the latest anniversary update has incensed many with paltry offerings and little acknowledgment of the community support that has taken miHoYo this far since a year ago. They have essentially ignored any and all feedback in favor of promoting a long marketing scheme, and for that it was inevitable that there be pushback critique.",1
I really love this game and have been playing since Dragonspine was released with the Albedo banner and I haven‚Äôt done a review until now because I‚Äôm lazy but now the fact that y‚Äôall are trynna give Genshin low reviews based off of what they didn‚Äôt give you for the anniversary event is just sad. Overall Genshin is a good game and shouldn‚Äôt be getting such low reviews because people are being picky and bratty about rewards they didnt get. Don‚Äôt hate on the game because you‚Äôre not getting what you wanted for the event be grateful that they gave us anything at all based on the backlash from you people. Now I‚Äôm not saying they couldn‚Äôt do better but still y‚Äôall are just being petty at this point :/,5
"when there are new updates I delete every app I have to get enough storage to the point where I have more than enough storage to download it but it still says not enough storage, I have deleted and reinstalled this app way to many times. at this point I‚Äôm about to buy a new device with more storage and just play genshin on there. I am furious, mihoyo fix this now before I explode.üòêthis app takes up too much storage and I understand it‚Äôs a very good game but 2gb or more for one update is a bit too much my device has 32gb only and I‚Äôm suffering every time there is a new update. it is 12:00pm right now and I‚Äôm up writing this review and trying to download the new Ayaka update and I cannot count how many times I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled this app.I am going to burst.‚ò∫Ô∏èüíïthe things I do for this game .üòØ",3
"I started playing last night randomly around like 11:30, thought it wouldn‚Äôt be out until later in the day but it worked out. Played a little bit and had a good time. Seriously played this game all day after work, it does have like p2w mechanics I guess, however I haven‚Äôt even tried them and have just been playing with the stock characters and have been having a blast. The story is pretty decent for a mobile game, definitely can‚Äôt wait to have a little more free time to check this out on my pc. It seriously looks better on the iPad Pro than breath of the wild does in switch hand held mode, which is pretty impressive. Haven‚Äôt found any of the random glitchy things that people are talking about but I‚Äôm sure they probably are there as this game is pretty new.",4
"Great game! You must try it out! But, the game is very laggy and buggy. Sometime it takes a minute after the chest has been opened for the items to drop out. Sometimes the mobs don‚Äôt spawn in. Sometimes the game crashes. Sometimes the items‚Äô picture when you are collecting doesn‚Äôt match the actual item, most of the time(I don‚Äôt know why) its always the character experience book that replace the image of the item instead of the item itself. And, the CG is very laggy. I am on a quite new iPad, and I am lagging my brain out during the CG. Plz fix the above problem! Great game overall! ‚ÄúEdit: and plz plz plz fix the problem that takes 2 min to load the game! My iPad is brand new and I have no idea why it is causing that‚Äù",5
"I cannot play for more than 10 minutes at a time before my game crashes. I don‚Äôt even want to play now because it‚Äôs become so frequent. I love the game and it deserves 4-5 stars but it‚Äôs getting a 2 until my iPhone stops crashing in the middle of missions and quests. The only thing I see is that it recommends 8 plus and above but I see nowhere what‚Äôs exactly causing the issues when I have my graphics on lowest and brightness down, it still crashes on my 8. It‚Äôs just not good that these things are being addressed yet stuff like resin is being worked on(something that your money can go towards to help you take on bosses and stuff for loot that you have to wait hours to regain naturally). If you have anything under an 8, don‚Äôt play the game because you‚Äôll have an awful experience and they won‚Äôt address anyone‚Äôs concerns or complaints as far as I‚Äôve seen, at all or anywhere.",2
"After playing for the past week it‚Äôs become very clear the multiple barriers Mihoyo has set up within the game to restrict its players. It‚Äôs really a shame too, because I love this game and I think it‚Äôs a game that exceeded my expectations.  It just sours the whole experience knowing that the company behind this game is borderline forcing you to pay money in order to advance in the game.  I want to spend money on this game because I want to support the developers for a job well done, I don‚Äôt want to spend money on this game because it‚Äôs necessary for me to spend money just to get more materials to upgrade my characters. (Which I‚Äôll also never be able to max out because that‚Äôll require me to spend money summoning 5+ duplicates just to unlock the characters full potential)",3
"Okay so with this new update everyone is yelling, WHITE WASHERS! But guys have you not stopped to realize the ‚Äúwhite characters‚Äù are actually WHITE. Like a pale of snow, dead as a doorknob colourless corpse, pale. Sure this is something to be pointed out but just remember in Japan there‚Äôs like .009% black residents. In all actuality the Asians whitewash themselves because their skin is much darker than a Caucasian‚Äôs/ Europeans yet in this game their actually the palest. And because the other characters are so pale the black characters are dark in comparison, it actually fits the pallet. Also there is the fact that this is a fantasy world. It‚Äôs meant to resemble the real world not mimic it. So the fact that they actually bother with using multiple cultures and skins and having different races means they are trying",4
"I started playing this game a little over a year ago for about five months, until I deleted it for storage. I re-downloaded it about three weeks ago and fell in love all over again. Genshin Impact's plots and character dialogues are beautifully written, coming from a writer. The tiniest details from the landscapes and animals, etc., are breathtaking. From the whoosh of the characters' dresses to the movement of the grass as your character walk, it's amazing. Now, I'm still just a teenager but this is hands-down one of the best games I've played. I do have a few suggestions, but I would still love the game even if you guys don't add them.

1. Maybe a clothes shop? That sounds immature and childish but I would love it if I could dress Amber, Lisa, Kaeya, etc., in customized outfits. 

2. Customized storylines? It would be amazing to be able to have my character have a romance or rivalry or strong friendship with another character in the game, such as Kaeya or Venti. 

Those are all the suggestions I have, keep up the great work! To anyone who likes fantasy, adventure, mystery and dystopian role playing games, I would highly recommend this game.",4
"Genshin impact includes different regions with different cultures but hoyoverse refuses to give us characters that have darker skin tones. We only have Xinyan and Kaeya and they are only tan + Xinyan is based off of so many stereotypes. After seeing Sumeru leaks me and many other Genshin fabs have been disgusted and annoyed after seeing that all but one of these characters were pale.(one of them was literally luminescent as well????) I see that there have been 4 new npcs that have a tan skin tone but that is nothing seeing as how much hoyoverse has slacked off with some of their playable character designs. We know that hoyoverse is capable of adding characters with cultural clothing and aspect since we have Yun Jin. If you can‚Äôt do real research about other cultures you shouldn‚Äôt be implementing them in your game. Give us actual dark skinned playable characters, not just the light tan that we see time and time again.",1
"This game is amazing! I love the lore, the play style, and most of the characters! But the lack of diversity is sickening!! Seeing sumeru about to come out (based on Middle eastern and south Asia) and having mostly PALE characters is so upsetting coming from a south Asian here!!! Not to mention the ones that are ‚Äútan‚Äù are four stars, are they not important enough to be a five star because of their skin?? This is extremely upsetting. I know they are capable of researching and finding appropriate character designs, I mean heck they did it with yun jin. If they can‚Äôt be respectful towards these sumeru character I‚Äôm so worried for natlan (based on indigenous America) and when I say I want more more skin tones and good representation, I don‚Äôt mean just tan. I want bunches of different skin tones in the darker range!! I‚Äôm talking cool toned, red toned, and olive toned. please fix this!! Best wishes, remi.",3
"I recently realized that my life is not very interesting but this game changed that thought. Playing genshin feels like the travels life is yours. The storyline in this game is the peek of imagination. The power the players have are absolutely admirable. Yae miko is one of my favorite characters. And yes this game can be hard but when you have moments of delight this game is most of them. At least in my playing. The storyline is so interesting and the events are so fun, it‚Äôs like going to a birthday party were you can do anything. And the streamers and YouTubers are always amazing at showing how fun this game is. If you want to get into genshin u recommend watching, tuonto and antonychenn. As I wrote this crying you might realize how much I love this game.",5
"i love genshin, and i think it‚Äôs a great game. however, i don‚Äôt recommend buying any in app purchases from it, because things may become lost in translation. i bought the gnostic chorus for the monthly battle, specifically because i wanted the rewards that it CLAIMED to come with. it was extremely vague, and i was under the impression that i would be receiving the awards upon purchase. however, once i did, i was left with nothing. i didn‚Äôt realize until after i was finished digging through the internet that i still had to reach level 50 of the battle pass, which was the sole reason i bought it anyways. DO NOT BUY THAT, UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THAT! i just gave the game my money and got nothing in return. i will not be buying again. mihoyo, please make your players CLEAR on what they are buying.",3
"I‚Äôve played this game for a few months now and have loved it. I play for hours straight sometimes. There is beautiful scenery, epic boss fights, and more. New events are added all the time so there is always something to do. I love the lore and characters. The characters have unique designs and backstories, making them that much more interesting to play. I love how they even have their own roles, like gods/goddesses and their people. 
Sometimes things can be disappointing, like rewards. Some can be unexpected but really good! The team is very rewarding though, like giving us codes and free primogems! I have a very positive opinion on this game and I think I will continue playing for a long time.",5
"[spoilers are in here!] I really love this game! It has a lot of good events and story quests! People do complain about the rewards but i don't have a problem with it! There is bugs for me, Sometimes i cant even click the wishing and when I'm able to click it nothing pops up, not even the banners. All i saw was just the background. Thats the only bug i‚Äôd like to share on this one! I feel really bad for the community we had created because its gotten a lot toxic now a days‚Ä¶ I don't want this to be deleted ever! So i‚Äôd like to make sure you guys have tons of breaks and good look on the next archons! Let the wind lead~!",5
"I played this game for many an hour, enjoying it to the fullest. And when the story content was over, there was nothing left to do. The ‚Äúend game‚Äù is just a giant waste of time until the next content patch. This company is stingy and refuses to care about its f2p community even a little bit. If you aren‚Äôt a whale, mihoyo does not care a single bit how satisfied you are. Yoimiya has problems? No response. Baal doesn‚Äôt work with other electro characters? No response. But, god forbid, the community has fun with a bug like Kokomi‚Äôs water glitch? Immediate action. Mihoyo deliberately ignores your feedback, asks for your money, and withholds any sort of substantial reward for playing this game for an extended period of time. I recommend you spend your time on a game with a better dev team that cares about what you say even if you don‚Äôt regularly spend thousands of dollars.",2
"To start, I‚Äôve been playing this game for 322 days and before this I‚Äôve loved it. But now I realize just how much Mihoyo hates the community. Despite making billions of dollars, this company shows over and over again how much they hate their players. Not only do they refuse to give us satisfactory anniversary rewards (despite, once again, making MILLIONS every single month) they also started censoring anyone who talks badly about said anniversary rewards on their social media. It‚Äôs difficult to get pulls in the endgame and for a company that makes so much from the players, you would think they‚Äôd be nicer to us. But no, mihoyo remains greedy instead of doing what literally every gacha game does: give us good anniversary rewards as compensation for helping them get this far.

Also, mihoyo is very predatory and refuses to release a roadmap or any knowledge about future updates so that people will be more likely to spend money.",1
"Mihoyo, a billion dollar company (thanks to it‚Äôs community), has been out for a year and it is thanking it‚Äôs player base by having them gacha for the 1 YEAR anniversary rewards OUTSIDE of the game. It‚Äôs asking for free advertising and only A SELECT amount of people will actually receive awards worth receiving. Although, I‚Äôm sure many will agree that giving out a free 5 star or a 5 star weapon is much better than giving out electronics. It‚Äôs like a slap to the face to everyone who has supported this game financially. This was not a very wise move Mihoyo. If you truly want to attract new players who will continue to support this game financially, then I would suggest you give out more generous rewards to ALL of the people who PLAY the game. We shouldn‚Äôt be competing to receive 100 primogems and electronics. Many people who ACTUALLY spend money on this game will quit because of the lack of generosity from your part.",1
"This is an amazing game! I love everything about it but I have a big issue. I am repeatedly getting kicked out of the game. To the point where I literally can‚Äôt even play the game. This is very disappointing and I KNOW it isn‚Äôt my wifi. It was running perfectly smooth until a few days ago when I tried to get on Genshin to play, it wouldn‚Äôt stop kicking me off the game. It usually occurs when I try to edit the characters stuff, try to wish, or check announcements. But that‚Äôs changed and gotten worse, it now doesn‚Äôt even let me past the loading screen to enter the game. So PLEASE get back to me and help. This is literally my favorite game and I really want to up my AR. I‚Äôm only AR 22 and can‚Äôt do anything now. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEE help!!",4
"I discovered this game through a cosplayer I follow, and I loved it as soon as I downloaded it! It has an amazing open world, beautiful graphics and soundtracks, and awesome characters! While it technically is a gacha game, I haven‚Äôt needed to spend any money in order to get some great characters, including several 5 stars! My one complaint would be the absurd amount of storage it takes up - I had to switch to playing only on my phone, because my iPad couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. But it does make sense, given the HUGE amount of data in the game. It‚Äôs just something Mihoyo might want to look into decreasing, if they want to keep their mobile users happy! (and able to download the game)",5
"I still have no idea how this game is for free. Everything is so greatly detailed, the storyline and characters are amazing! There is so much you can do in the game and the fact that there‚Äôs a bunch of land to uncover is super fun! I‚Äôve had this game since April and all the events that have came were super fun especially when saving up primogems for a character/weapon that you want (also, co-op is a really fun way to play with your friends or with random people)! I am super excited for the 2.0 update and i‚Äôm looking forward to all the new characters and storylines! I‚Äôll recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, open world game with a bunch of exciting events coming their way ‚Äî with amazing music!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"This game is great because, unlike most games nowadays you have to pay for every single thing, but this game, you would only pay if you wanted more money, or a special character, it is like Roblox or Animal Jam, you basically get it all free‚Ä¶ and I personally love anime, and mixing it with an adventure game? YESSIR! You get free will to explore and hang out wherever, you can climb the mountains, swim everywhere, and do small/ big tasks, which most are part of the storyline, overall it‚Äôs great, you can also fight online with other players, and the graphics are just üòôüëåüèª
Not to mention all the unlockable characters there are, and their different powers, and don‚Äôt even get me started on How A d o r a b l e Paimon is.",5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this game and I would totally recommend this game to other people, But it takes up like a large amount of space on my mobile device and it started getting a little boring. I have very limited space, And Genshin technically takes up almost 1/2 of it and it‚Äôs really annoying to me because I barely have anything else to play when I feel like it so I have to delete Genshin and add the game I want. Then delete the game later on and add Genshin back. But the only time I really hate it is when I need to update. Also when I‚Äôm also in co-op with my friends, I feel like we should be able to talk to certain people instead of them leaving then coming back. 

But either way it‚Äôs just fine, ‚ù§Ô∏èLove ya",4
The game itself is beautiful! The graphics are amazing and the attention to detail as wellü§© The characters have very interesting story lines and the voice actors bring them to life. The gameplay is also amazing. The graphics of the abilities and ultimates is very nice. RPG games like this where you get to explore with a team and collect things and fight monsters is to my taste. The only thing I would change though is the pity system.üôÅ The pity is to high and I think at least lowering it by 10 would be better and the company could still get money and the players have a better chance of getting what they want. Doing this will make the game way better especially since it‚Äôs very hard to get 5-star characters.,5
"I‚Äôve only had this game for about 2 weeks and I‚Äôve been addicted to it, I love the open world, the chances to wish and get higher ranked weapons as well as new characters. I do play on my phone and it may lag here or there, overall not really an issue for me, BUT I‚Äôm currently stuck in the chalk prince quest and I simply can not do anything else, I can‚Äôt ascend, do other quests, or even co-op and do other things to level up or better my characters to possibly go back and try to finish the quest for the event.  I‚Äôm very disappointed in this, due to the fact of I‚Äôm just ‚Äústuck‚Äù in it... I love this game but this ‚Äúbug‚Äù issue will really kill my drive to play this game.. I want to better my characters and go farther into the story but at this current moment I simply cannot due to this issue with this quest.",3
"I‚Äôve always wanted to play a game like world of Warcraft but not to competitive. Reason why Is I would have to rely on my teammates to do there jobs on defeating the boss, this games not that bad you‚Äôll have lots of good times wondering around the game. The only downside is that you have to spend a lot of money to get good characters and good gear for them it‚Äôs somewhat unfair, you may not even unlock that bought character full talent. You could spend 500 dollars and you would not even get half of that‚Äôs character talent unlocked. Same goes for the gear it‚Äôs Kind of depressing this game has great potential I‚Äôm a big fan of this game I love open world games and I love anime.",5
"Everything about this game is amazing. There's absolutely NO ads (or at least none that I've come across in my few hours of gameplay), it's FREE, AND it's open world. The whole time I'm playing this it feels like I'm playing a game on console or PC, it's so extremely well done. The graphics are wonderful, character designs are beautiful, even the enemies are designed extremely well. It's overall an extremely beautiful game and the gameplay makes it feel like I'm actually playing it on console. If this game ever makes it to the Switch, god knows how many hours I will put into it. Gameplay is amazing, it feels extremely natural during combat, running around and collecting things across the world feels awesome. It's so satisfying to play!",5
"i feel like this game has its pros and cons; it‚Äôs not perfect ofc but it isnt the worse either! especially their business moves, etc.

pros;

VISUALS are absolutely gorgeous, character designs, the graphic qualities and the regions 10/10

lore!! as a new player there‚Äôs plenty of content (definitely recommend slowing down once and awhile take your time it‚Äôs not going anywhere!) out there to eat. especially simce everything is so new.

characters! each are their own individual they have their good side and their flaws. they seem so real, and not fake. i can relate to some of the characters or feel empathy towards them

cons;

not enough to do in the later games; what i mean is that in the emd game there‚Äôs nothing much to do but help farm comm abyss events. it‚Äôs just so repetitive, and as a genshin player we get burnout. leading us to stop play for weeks or months.

event rewards;
there‚Äôs not a lot of them, i believe the lanternrite only gave us around 680 primogems (dont take my word for it!). it is barely enough to do a 10 roll. it‚Äôs a major issue since there‚Äôs not a lot to do to get primogems especially for end game players. unless you buy them yourself.",4
I LOVE this game but it need less storage because I can‚Äôt download the game no more because of the storage üò¢üò¢üò¢ I love my Hu Tao and more but I think it need less storage to download or do update I hope this can help with people with not a lot of storage pls I need to play  or I‚Äôll be crying because I spent a lot of time making my characters :( and I have a friend who was excited about me coming back for like nine months or less idk so pls make the updates have less storage because I shared this account with my little sister my name is Stephanie I 23 and my sis is 10  and she loves this game too so pls The only thing I can do right now is playing Roblox but I think this game is more fun.,5
"I've been playing genshin since the beginning and i love it but, the lack of character representation is heartbreaking, before sumeru character leaks, characters were extremely pale, yes being pale is fine but for characters who work on a boat for hours a day to be as pale as paper, is extremely colorist and unrealistic. the sumeru characters completely lack representation. yes, pale people exist in the swana region but not every single person. most people for multiple reasons are tan and it's stupid how characters like kusanali, al haitham, and tighnari are paler than the characters in mondstat. this company makes millions of dollars, it's not hard for darker skin tones. the few times characters have been tan, xinyan for example, you made her extremely stereotypical, southern, plays guitar, described as loud and scary. in your other game honkai impact, the character carol and canon black woman, says that she hates her skin tone. that is extremely colorist. please fix this.",1
"i, as an addicted player have to say that genshin for sure needs improvement. events are able to be cleared (for more experienced players) in a day. there needs to be more events, or at least if there isn‚Äôt more events added they need to be spread out more. sumeru, a region that is supposed to be based off of middle eastern and south asian cultures/areas, had from what i‚Äôve seen all light colored npcs. it‚Äôs disgusting. i know that genshin impact is a game based in china, and people there haven‚Äôt seen much of darker skin tones, but this simple fact shouldn‚Äôt excuse the lack of representation. there are only two darker colored people in genshin. sure, it‚Äôs some representation. but those areas are based in germany and china. there isn‚Äôt even a darker toned person in inazuma. 

also, new players suffer with genshin. for example, a banner out for a character from inazuma is running and a new played wants them. they only can get that character to level 20 and then from there can‚Äôt level them up more until they go through the long story, and about the time they get to inazuma they probably don‚Äôt care anymore.

i hope genshin actually listens to their community, especially when it comes to more variety. i really hope that hoyoverse isn‚Äôt just some money hungry app, and actually cares about their fan base.",1
"this game has great music but that‚Äôs about it. if you play do not spend money. there are bugs that haven‚Äôt been fixed since launch. the in game rewards are trash. 98% of the characters are pale, no inclusion of darker characters even though the game is based on real places. the story quests and events vary in quality, mostly being boring or badly written. they don‚Äôt listen to players, several characters need buffs since previous units are power crept by anyone new. did I mention the rewards are garbage? they give us more primo gems (wish currency) for maintenance than they did for the game‚Äôs anniversary. there‚Äôs no way to really farm primos for wishes, and it‚Äôs way too expensive. this company has acquired over a billion dollars from this game alone. why can‚Äôt they give us better rewards? the game is nice, the music is nice, and some characters will make you want to play. if you do download genshin, do NOT spend a dime on it.",1
"This is the greatest game ever!! I‚Äôll list some pros and cons for those who are unsure!!! PROS it has beautiful quality! Words cannot describe how great it is!! The wish system is amazing too! It‚Äôs very easy to get primos too! The bosses are very unique!! The characters are unique!!!!!! There are archon quests! ( I‚Äôm in geo rn) CONS If you get a character from inazuma you won‚Äôt be able to accend them to be stronger! I have Sayu and Kujou Sara and it‚Äôs kinda annoying to realize that you need to go to inazuma to accend them. Other than that, it‚Äôs amazing and I‚Äôm close to going to inazuma so not that big of a problem! :) I hope you think about getting Genshin Impact and realize that it‚Äôs amazing and addicting!!! -‚ô° (That‚Äôs literally my user)",5
This game has a massive open world and much to explore but when I play on my iPad 5th Gen the sky looks black and I can‚Äôt see anything in the sky but when I play on my iPhone 7 the sky looks just fine and it also has a pretty good story to there are a lot of micro transactions but you can complete the game without them. It has a very exciting combat as. most the time will be roaming around in the beautiful open world it has to offer fighting enemies and getting treasure chest. I looked through most open world games and I have to say this is the best one. Even though you do need six more gigabytes to play the whole game so that‚Äôs 9 GB it‚Äôs still worth it,5
"Omg I have been playing this game since I‚Äôm the beginning so I have been playing when it just had been released and I have since Genshin improve on so many things, the game has become this most amazing mobile games i know. The graphics are just amazing as well as the music, Genshin has a whole Orchestra to make the music which makes it more better if an experience. The characters have so much thought and work in them as well as the character  demos and teasers they make. The amount of effort Mihoyo puts into this game is amazing I‚Äôm surprised it free! I say get it it will change your life. I play this every single day and not have been off itüòÇ u will get obsessed!!!",5
"I do admit yes I was also quite disappointed about the rewards, but we also have to think, this is a free game with amazing graphics, they could have mad us pay 20 dollars considering how well this game was made. All the effort put into the graphics, lore, and detail is so much. We also need to know that an anniversary is not a gift for others, its a celebration for the company as well, yes they could have given us a little bit more but considering that the game has given us so much in the past, I think we should give them at least a little bit of grace. This is all my opinion so don‚Äôt take it to seriously if you don‚Äôt want to.",5
"I could go into many reasons from character design to Lore to even so much as the animals, plants, and other creatures! I know how much work it takes to put something BIG together and I think their doing an amazing job! The characters are original and their back stories even more so, you can tell thoughts and emotions have been put into this game! The lore is incredibly rich and full of secrets that go beyond just the main storyline, clearly this story of the traveler has been put into A LOT of thought. The creatures from the little foxes to the first flowers! Everything about this is so amazing and I‚Äôm very thankful to have the developers create such a master piece. 3 lands or not, I am VERY thankful!",5
"Honestly I love this game! The community has its good and bad like every other game it also has its toxic part of the fandom but overall it‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôll just be running around in game and a friend or just a random person joins my co op and offers to help me fight bosses! I‚Äôm decently weak for my AR lvl to I only do about 200 or 500 DMG but half the time the other person doesn‚Äôt mind and they will carry me through bosses and battles! Luckily for me when I co op I haven‚Äôt met anyone toxic cus iv seen people online get attacked and slandered for who they main and it‚Äôs usually people who main more common characters like noelle and sucrose. I personally used to main noelle cus she was my healer, main shield, and she did the most DMG.",5
"Genshin is an amazing open world rpg with great graphics and an interesting storyline. At first, I really enjoyed the game and it‚Äôs gameplay, but I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year and I‚Äôve grown to strongly dislike it. 
The gacha system is horrid, even if you pay to win you have to waste over 100 dollars to get enough pulls to reach pity (since the 5 star chance is so low) and if you‚Äôre free to play you don‚Äôt even get one wish a day through daily commissions. You have to grind chests and play events that honestly have gotten repetitive and boring. The only good thing about the game is the characters but since the gacha is so awful you can‚Äôt even enjoy that.
Also, the anniversary rewards were absolute garbage.",4
"As someone whos been playing genshin impact for 9 months, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in Mihoyo. This game is absolutely amazing and I used to spend 5+ hours a day AT LEAST. I‚Äôve spent over $500 dollars (which isnt much compared to whales and content creators, but its still a lot as a teen being payed minimum wage) and I feel incredibly let down. Mihoyo doesnt owe players an anniversary reward, but it would be nice to be shown appreciation since they made it where they are due to the players time and money. Not to mention the burn-out and lack of end game content. Mihoyo needs to listen to their community and step it up, or else a lot of people will be upset and theyll lose a lot of paying players.",5
"I honestly love this game, but downloading it on my devices take forever. It may be different for everybody but for me it takes 1 hour and 10 minutes at tops to download, and that‚Äôs only my guess. I understand how a complicated game like this takes up a lot of space but it‚Äôs really slow and gets annoying. I don‚Äôt think this is a problem because of the game or just my device. I can‚Äôt really tell, but if this can be fixed that would be great. The other thing is, when your doing a quest co op isn‚Äôt available, and when your under leveled and is doing a quest that you can‚Äôt beat, it gets really annoying. But overall if you have a developed brain unlike mine you should be fine.",4
"I did not want to have to come to this point BUT, I have had many hopes on mihoyo, and I still do, but so far they‚Äôve let me down with the lack of appreciation on the players who play their game. A whole year of grinding a game and as soon as you get to end game, it literally feels like a chore. Commissions everyday with no exciting content, the lack of primos everyday, commissions don‚Äôt even get you a wish, not even have of one. Anniversary should be something big and in my opinion the Lantern Riot event gave wayyyy better rewards than this. I am EXTREMELY disappointed to what this game has come to and how a lot of people are feeling now on this anniversary and it‚Äôs crappy rewards.",5
"When I deleted this game for honkai, I played it a bit then deleted it and re-downloaded genshin, when I logged into my account all my progress was gone, all my characters and stuff. I had gotten reseted all the way to the start where I choose which sibling. I‚Äôm crying so much because I had that account since December. I want my account back. I want it back, I know it‚Äôs a game but I really liked the game and now all of my liking has gone to waste. All because I deleted in and reinstalled it again. Please give my account back, my name was maries part of this is my fault because I already forgot my Id. Please, I deleted it because I probably won‚Äôt get it back and I‚Äôm probably won‚Äôt be playing for a long time. Goodbye to another player.",4
"I love this game. I recommend it to friends, and family. After playing free to play, I even threw in some money because I do support great entertaining experiences and it was worth every penny. I love and support the community around this game, the content creators, and the artists. The Resin system needs to be reworked. I did not rush the game, and even spend time in the environments just hanging out and co-op with my buds. But as an ongoing game it‚Äôs Mihoyo‚Äôs duty to keep on trying to better their craft and art, and the Resin system is utterly lacking compared to Honkai. The pull rates could even be changed from pity 90 to maybe 50 or even 70. I log in daily and am super excited for future content, but for ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù engagement with the drop rates for materials, the Resin needs a major upgrade.",4
"Let me start off saying the game is fantastic, I play it on a daily basis on pc for sometimes numerous hours. The characters are amazing, the story is captivating, there‚Äôs so much to explore, it‚Äôs just an amazing game. I would absolutely recommend anyone to play the game, but mobile is not the way to go. I can‚Äôt go 5 minutes without being kicked out of the game or having to close the game and restarting it. It just crashes consistently, and watching cutscenes and making progress is impossible. I couldn‚Äôt take it, so I stopped playing the game. It wasn‚Äôt until I tried it on pc that I picked it back up again. I really wish some changes could be made so it doesn‚Äôt crash every 10 seconds, because I can‚Äôt carry a pc with me everywhere. I‚Äôd like to play this game some more on mobile but it‚Äôs just terrible. I‚Äôm looking forward to what changes Mihoyo will make and what the future holds. üòä",1
"i like this game even though the writing is a bit meh and its heavily influenced by some other rpgs. i have a few problems
1. why is gaining pirogems so hard?? i get that the pirogem currency isnt supposed to be easily obtained to make people spend money but does it have to be this hard? after a point your only source of pgems (that matters) becomes the infrequent gifts they send pls make it at least a little easier
2. why is it that u can only play with people in your area.. idk much about this stuff but im p sure there are ways to allow people from different parts of the world to play together. i have american and european friends and we cant play together! playing together was the main reason why we downloaded the game so its somewhat disappointing 

i dont really care that much about the pirogems issue but PLEASE fix the server stuff its so limiting",3
"This game is fantastic. The visuals are amazing, the environmental interactions of the characters keeps things interesting, and the controls are smooth. A huge bonus is that my same account can be played on my phone or computer and I‚Äôm able to do everything on both.

People talk about the gacha aspect, but I haven‚Äôt paid anything, and I find the premium currency to be given pretty freely from just playing. I‚Äôm one who will probably invest some money the later I play solely because I think the developers do earn it for creating a great game. By paying just a little, I can benefit myself and them, which is a good deal. I‚Äôm not at that point yet and I‚Äôm just enjoying the ride right now.",5
"To start I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while now, on all platforms. It‚Äôs my favorite game right now and probably one of my favorite games I‚Äôve ever played. At the beginning I thought this was a sort of knock-off of the new Zelda game on the Switch, but I was never more wrong. Yes it has some similarities but this game has so much more variety in my opinion compared to Zelda. With all of the new characters you can earn and more coming, it‚Äôs hard to compete with a game like this, and by far this game is probably the best game to have ever come to mobile in a while (excluding Among us). The storyline is amazing too. I can‚Äôt wait to see all of the new updates arrive and how they could change different strategies of combat and much more!",5
"Okay so I downloaded the game and after it finished I clicked on the game and a white screen appeared. After a while it took me back to home on the iPhone and I was like what the heck so I tried again to only find that the screen instead of being white was both black and white. Once again it took me home so I deleted and downloaded nothing happened, I restarted my phone and nope nothing then I just deleted and forgot about it. But now it says that the game is downloaded on the App Store and it says open as per usual if you have a game downloaded. But I don‚Äôt even have it installed so I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs something with the game or my phone. Please get back to me",5
"I downloaded and registered for this what I‚Äôve heard wonderful game, and don‚Äôt get me wrong I believe it! I was about to join the server and begin my adventure as whatever I am when it asked me something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre game is on demo, would you like to switch to a higher quality version?‚Äù Or something, I‚Äôm sure you know what you mean. I said yes to this question, after I clicked it ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have sufficient storage.‚Äù So I went though my photos (deleted at-least 600) and checked my storage. (It‚Äôs pretty clean) It still won‚Äôt let me in the game! And I‚Äôve tried. So many times. 

I‚Äôm unsure on how to fix and or undo this problem. I wasn‚Äôt sure either on where to contact you all so I just put it into a review.",4
"Could not pet or interact with dog in Monstadt. Needs immediate patch. 0/10 horrible experience. Not being able to pet doggo has left my game experience a fragment of its glory. This dog rolls over onto her back and that belly is literally begging for scritches. And yet, no such relief is coming. Oh how the cries echo through the air!

The game is unbalanced. It‚Äôs amazing, by far the most visually amazing game I‚Äôve played so far. It‚Äôs astounding how far mobile gaming has come. The game is relatively high spec, but that‚Äôs completely understandable. It‚Äôs a breath of the wild clone with gacha team building, the game needs more horses and less teleporting. The combat is fun, first few missions are really boring, though it gets better over time. But that dog. It makes this game... Completely unplayable.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years, and I can safely say this game is great. The world is beautiful, the character designs are great, and the combat is great. Though the story can feel a bit monotonous in the beginning, and sometimes a bit rushed, it gets a lot better the more you progress. The wishing system is also nice, including a pity system. If you‚Äôre familiar with the genre of gacha games and are really looking for one to invest your time in, genshin is the one!

Something that you should know is that every update is about 2gbs big. There is an update about every 42 days, excluding one version which had a delay, so just make sure your storage is prepared!",5
"Genshin Impact is a great game to play alone and with friends. For new players it‚Äôs an endless world of exploration and characters and storyline. However, the game is way to big for its own good, Mobile players struggle with downloading the game and I find myself constantly having to delete and reinstall it before a big update (a trick I use to trick my storage into thinking it‚Äôs less than it is) Half the time before a big update I can‚Äôt enjoy the game for a few days because I need to clear up storage. It‚Äôs honestly so annoying but I‚Äôm willing to put up with it for how good of a game it is. It‚Äôs a great game but updates such as letting players delete files from older updates that they don‚Äôt need anymore would be nice.",4
"This game is good. Great, even. I spend a lot of time on it and enjoy the open world aspect, storyline, and even the ability to build characters and make them do loads of damage. But it‚Äôs taken a downhill plunge with the release of Sumeru, a nation based on the Middle East. The environment, music, and even the recipes are amazing! But the time and effort gone into these characters is highly disappointing. Even Candace / Kandake, Dehya, Cyno, and Nilou are disappointing. They are our ‚Äòdarker skin‚Äô rep and as a paler person I am a lot tanner than they are.

Middle Easterners can be pale, but when a game is filled with already pale individuals it‚Äôs less of adding inclusivity and more of being intolerant. I‚Äôm scared for Natlan, as that‚Äôs a region I‚Äôll be able to relate to because my family‚Äôs culture is from the countries it‚Äôs based off of. I hope Hoyo can actually improve on the designs for Sumeru in the upcoming updates and go above and beyond for Natlan and their culture.",1
"My cousin has told me such great things about this game, but I downloaded it yesterday and everything was going smoothly until it started downloading data, and it‚Äôs been two in a half days and it‚Äôs barely at 12.0 and I‚Äôve been waiting since 12:15pm (yesterday) for this thing to finish, my sisters has gone so much faster than mine it‚Äôs probably finished but she downloaded hers at 4:30 pm (yesterday) and it started going faster and faster without the app being open. I have tried keeping the app open for about 2 3 hours, and I‚Äôve tried closing the app and not opening it for about 3 hours and I have tried not even using my phone for about 5 hours. I just want to play the game and it won‚Äôt let me!.",4
"We all know the game was created in China, that‚Äôs where the magic happens. One thing about China is the beauty standard is pale skin, Very colorist and overall strange. We get that‚Äôs what you guys love and find attractive, but that isn‚Äôt the same for the fans. We enjoy genshin gameplay and lore. Another thing is skin tones and areas the map is based on. Of course, Sumeru is based of Southeast Asia, and south Africa. The skin tones there are darker, not white enough that they are glowing. Out of the entirety of Sumeru, there is ONE tan character and of course, as expected, she is a four star like the other tan characters. Would it really hurt you to make more realistic skin tones? Especially in Sumeru because of where it‚Äôs based off of. Though the beauty standard in China is extremely pale almost, white, Most of your fans see the beauty in darker skin tones and would love to embrace it. Do better Hoyoverse.",2
"This game promised me a great diversity of characters to interact with, but so far I have hardly met anyone that resembles me. I have seen the videos with the devs talking about all the extensive research they have done on different regions in the world to base Teyvat off of, but despite all this they are seriously lacking in any actual skin diversity. It feels unfair to advertise as a diverse world when only a fraction of people are represented. And this upcoming land of Sumeru, from what I‚Äôve seen is supposed to be based off of SWANA culture but all the npcs we have so far have only fair to pale skin. I know there is a lot of color diversity within the SWANA region but to not have at the very least a single npc who is colored feels discriminatory and colorist. Until Hoyoverse fixes their colorism problem I strongly cannot recommend this game to anyone. This is a shame because the story and music is wonderful, but without any of that promised diversity the story falls flat.",1
"Hi, here is the ‚Äúbad‚Äù news‚Ä¶ I get in the game right? After like 5-15 mins, it kicks me out and sometimes I have to start over from what I was doing. That‚Äôs weirdüòûüòûüòû anyway, sometimes when I fight, it does no damage and the monsters just attack me like my weapon is not real‚Ä¶ and the characters sometimes act weird. Not weird like glitch to make them look fat(not what i seen before) but they sometimes take damage when I‚Äôm not fighting or not falling of a mountain. And pls make a faster way to heal. 1 more thing‚Ä¶ make it sure when your doing a big quest, you can go to you pot thing with your house because I love the Serbiane pot (is that what it‚Äôs called?) but that is all",5
"hello i have a small problem in the game and i would like to know what is the cause of this small problem and if you can fix it i love the blessing of many other people buying welkin moon but recently it stopped giving me prizes it  Already said I've claimed the prize before I logged in I've missed days without claiming the prize I just want to know what the reason is because I bought it twice I'd appreciate it if you could answer this because I spent the money, I  Kind of shocked that they don't give me the price anymore, but if you read this, I want to thank you because I know you have a lot of work to do and I really appreciate it, but if you could look into what's going on,  I will be very grateful",4
"This is definitely one of my favorite games, I love all the characters and the storyline. It reminds me of all those online games but in anime‚Äôs, for example- sao! As well as the reason I even started this game was because of the character Hutao, she caught my eye and I wanted to play as her and I achieved that wish! She was my 2nd five star. I love her sm and I can‚Äôt wait to get even further into the game!! 

I guess the only problem is the loading, time to time it‚Äôd take me 2 minutes just to get in because of the loading screen but it always stops on the geo symbol but it‚Äôs not much of a biggy or hassle! As well as for celebrations, we should honestly get a bigger bonus primogems- at least to last us 15 pulls. <3

Keep up the good work!",4
"This game is just perfect and all the cutscenes are really nice. The Gacha system is ok but you just need to be patient with saving your primo gems. My few mains problems of the games are
that
- Since Inazuma I‚Äôve been super busy, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it done with some grinding but I think when all of that is done I think we are going to have to be bored again
- I think the oculous r very stupid and hard to find, I wish they where marked for you because I‚Äôm am AR 50 and still don‚Äôt have all of the geoculous
- My other reason is that it‚Äôs really laggy, I just wished that you could choose low or high graphics on ps4.
- My 2nd is that switch and Xbox players don‚Äôt have this game, I really want to play this game with friends but ik they are not gunns just buy a pc or download it on their phone because they have no storage
- My last reason is since I play on a PS4, we can‚Äôt connect our accounts to a PC or phone, I am getting a PC soon and I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to login into my account
Thank you for reading this, these are my few reasons why I did NOT give it 5 stars but I think overall this is a really game with a nice storyline .",4
"I was writing a review and then it closes on me!? That‚Äôs kinda weird. But back to I was originally saying. Mihoyo disappointed their players and supporters because of their rewards. After winning 2 whole rewards they do this? Kinda upsetting. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the game itself is great, to the storyline, characters, and overall concept. But it‚Äôs disappointing. Even fortnight would‚Äôve given their players a whole FREE CHARACTERS with some other rewards while Mihoyo gives us only 1,600 primogems!? After they gotten popular Mihoyo has stopped caring about their players and more about the money they‚Äôre making. Honestly very disappointed, hopefully the rewards get better and Mihoyo appreciates their players more but until now cant say I‚Äôm proud. Players were especially disappointed when it came to the anniversary rewards and I cant blame them. The rewards honestly sucked- just make your rewards better Mihoyo.",1
"Honestly, the gameplay, music, plot, and characters are all very unique and intricate. The two major issues I have for this game are the size and the lack of rewards. This game, currently, is 20gb in size. A lot of mobile users do not have that type of space! Secondly, as hard as players work to receive their rewards, they do not get much. Being that Genshin Impact is one of the top games of this year, they should be earning money based off of the gameplay of users and their ranking today. It‚Äôs a huge let-down, and it‚Äôs is too obvious that they want players to spend and spend until they can‚Äôt any further. Otherwise, good game for the most part, and this was in no means meant to criticize any of the workers who make this game possible. Just my issues and concerns :)",3
"My interests jump from one thing to another almost every month, but one thing that has been consistent is playing Genshin Impact. I have been playing this game since May 2021. I‚Äôve played other open world games, but I think this has to be the best. I love playing whether I‚Äôm doing solo or co-op. If you don‚Äôt want to spend money on the game, the events during a certain period allow you to have a chance to collect and spend on a weapon or character that you would like. And the storyline? It‚Äôs amazing! It actually makes me interested to learn about certain character‚Äôs backgrounds and the lore.
This is a game that I even want my friends to join in.",5
"the game entices you in as an early player by lots of rewards, but as you progress onwards you realize that you get little to no meaningful rewards after your initial download. endgame content is nonexistent, and long term players suffer. big spenders, low spenders, and free to play are all rewarded the same way: not at all. truly the one people who benefit from spending money on the game are streamers and content creators. the anniversary rewards were a slap in the face. instead of mihoyo listening to their worldwide fanbase, they censor us, ban us, and delete any negative opinions about them. i have played this game for an entire year, and the way they handled the anniversary has severely impacted my view on the game. instead of giving us rewards, they had us COMPETE to get a measly 100 primos. the game does not care about players. if you were considering playing: don't. it's not worth getting addicted. it is not rewarding.",1
I love this game so much I‚Äôve spent $700+ dollars on this game I have two accounts and play on both of them. And I‚Äôve been playing since day one and fell in love with this game. But Mihoyo you have stayed silent for far to long. We try to help by telling you what to fix in your game but you don‚Äôt listen there are some characters that need buffs but don‚Äôt get any. I hate the resin system it‚Äôs terrible I hate playing on a timer because I have to wait till resin to be refilled again. We all love this game but you don‚Äôt listen to your community. We don‚Äôt have regular updates to scale characters. There is no end game content it‚Äôs terrible we need like dungeons we can just farm without resin or raids we can do or something. The co-op system is trash like what can you even do with your friends really. I love this game but I don‚Äôt see me playing this game another year if Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt listen to its community. Thank you and goodnight,1
"Look, it‚Äôs pretty fun at first but once the shininess wears off it ends up just making you feel jaded about time and any money you may have put in. The end game is non existent. The story writing was never great but the pacing also takes a nosedive after the first few chapters. The world feels shallow and empty once explored. Artifacts are basically an impossible and unsatisfying grind. Multiplayer is poorly implemented. It seems that most of the developer time is spent on temporary events which is why the game has failed to significantly improve in the year since it‚Äôs launch. 

It‚Äôs not NOT worth your time, but guard your heart and don‚Äôt get too invested. If you‚Äôre tempted to spend money to ‚Äúprogress‚Äù your account - don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre just rushing towards feeling like there‚Äôs no game left. On top of this I‚Äôve just lost all my faith in this company so I personally don‚Äôt feel comfortable spending anything more here.",1
The game at its core is really fun and keeps you engaged but none of it really feels meaningful once you get to the end game because there isn‚Äôt very much difficult content the end game is just stuff you‚Äôve been doing the whole game and you just rinse and repeat over and over again also one of the few gacha games where i feel like being f2p put you at a severe disadvantage and you‚Äôre left to play catch up with others in the community or even with friends and the anniversary rewards are terrible i‚Äôve played many gachas and everytime an anniversary event comes around we get tons of rewards and they release a couple new characters in genshin‚Äôs case we get a copy and paste set of rewards and a terrible character banner being kokomi and even the community event rewards are terrible and have about the same rates as pulling a 5 star and mihoyo hasn‚Äôt said anything in response to the community‚Äôs backlash,1
"dear mihoyo, i used to love this game so much especially razor. but today i just got my 3rd jean. YALL REALLY DIDNT GIVE ME A WEAPON HUH jean is also the only 5 star i will never ever raise üò°üí¢ i really want wolfs gravestone please. pretty please mihoyooo or you can just give me ganyu and ill still he happy. but now my poor poor poor razor has to stick with that old 4 star craftable weapon. YUCK! anyways please mihoyo just wanted to let u know. do NOT give me anymore jeansüëñ PLEASE MIHOYO I BEG U and give me more 5 star weapons. i am literally crying irl rn i dont have proof but i am. bc getting jean 3 times is so sad. and when im going for 4 stars please dont give me any 5 stars. ik its my fault that i got yoimiya while rolling for sayu but still. just wanted to let u know mihoyo. can i also get better artifacts and buff yoimiya???? aoe arrows when?????? not like ganyu tho bc ganyu is so special. thank you for reading my long long letter it took me 20 hours just to write this.",1
This game is amazing and I play it on console but my only big issue with this game is the resin especially at higher levels and my request can you increase the resin u regenerate or the higher your adventure level the higher amount you have because this game is so good and it has so much more potential but you are driving away your community with the resin because everything uses 40-60 resin and you can only have a max of 120 so you are limiting our play time pretty much because there is no drive to us playing and I know this is new game and it is AMAZING but please give more resin because the content is there 100% but there is no point to getting to it because to get the rewards it cost resin so again please increase the resin amount or replenish rate but this game IS AMAZING 100%,4
I hate it I killed all my characters for a 5 star weapon that does not even go good dmg?!?and I was so excited to get Mona but my dreams got crushed bye yall I hope no one downloads this game they will get really mad and you don‚Äôt want viewers like this who tell the truth I would rate this 0 stars if I could but I can‚Äôt I need a refund on the five star weapon I need Mona I literally almost broke everything in my house because of this‚Ä¶. And y‚Äôall need to calm down trying to be stingy like god y‚Äôall not even that good of a game I do like the stuff and stuff but from time to time I almost deleted stuff like this and y‚Äôall are not getting nothing but the review yall lucky I even gave y‚Äôall one star like I hope no one downloads this app I would give it a 5 star if the System wasn‚Äôt so stingy and y‚Äôall need to fix a lot and make the system not so stingy If y‚Äôall did maybe more people would play-bye I hope this helps improve your game.,1
"i freaking love this game so much, it always has something for you to do and never really gets boring. it‚Äôs the type of game that you can play on a console and then go and play it on your phone or other things. you can easily be a f2p (free to play) player and still have fun, it may be harder to get the characters you would like but i swear it‚Äôs worth it. that moment of happiness you get when you get a character you have been saving up for is amazing. the graphics are also amazing and it‚Äôs really pretty. the only thing is that they don‚Äôt really explain a lot of things you kinda gotta learn them yourself but once you do it‚Äôs so much fun. i highly recommend this game.",5
"Alright, I love the game so much, I play a while to try to get new characters and unlock new places, but if you have a PC, I would recommend you get it on there, because the first day I started playing Genshin I used mobile, and the second day I decided to read some reviews (I don‚Äôt know why) and I saw this review that PC has better graphics, and oh my god, that review was not lying, it might just be my bad WiFi but I got kicked out of the game a lot on mobile, so I decided to try my PC and it has better graphics, it doesn‚Äôt kick you out, and (in my opinion) the controls are much easier, so if your going to download this, I would recommend you use a PC ( If you have one)",5
"So co op.... it‚Äôs very limited. You can‚Äôt do quests, open chests, or do certain dungeons. Like the Temple of the Lion, Temple of the Wolf, and things like that. You can‚Äôt even do quests with other people nor can you open the chests. Even if the person who works you joined open a chest, you don‚Äôt get any loot.

 Also, there should be something like a gifting system or perhaps a trading system. For example, when you have too much of an item and have no need for it, you can always trade it with someone for something you actually need. 

However, the graphics of the game is on point! It‚Äôs so breathtaking, like the graphics and gameplay are so well put together!! The characters are nice as well and I really love the game. 

The anime aesthetic plus the open world adventure is so also well designed. Another feature that I (and probably many other players as well) like is the fact that you can mark places. It‚Äôs so convenient and easy to use. The only reason i put 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the co op being limited but other than that I‚Äôm in love with this game!",5
"I know a lot of times you see reviews and wonder if they are paid. I promise you this one isn‚Äôt. This is the most fleshed out mobile game I have ever played and that‚Äôs AMAZING considering it‚Äôs Free to Play. The game has a slightly smaller region than BoTW but plays pretty much the same. The difficulty isn‚Äôt too crazy which is kind of a shame, but it has a really cool world to explore and some puzzles to handle along the way which aren‚Äôt crazy in difficulty but decent enough for, again, a free game. Now obv, it has micro transactions but the great thing is that they all basically feel cosmetic. The game gives you 5 characters for free through the story missions and never makes you feel like you need to purchase something to eliminate the grind. All in all, great game. Kudos to the developers.",4
"At first I wasn‚Äôt even going to get this game especially on iPhone. I saw it pop up on the store and though ‚Äúwhat the heck, let‚Äôs give it a shot,‚Äù and I am truly happy I did. The game plays extremely well and I love that the mechanics are similar to BOTW. I am extremely shocked that a game that looks this good plays that well on iPhone. I was looking up comparisons on the pc version and phone version graphics wise, and phone version is lighter color wise while the pc version is a little darker, and that‚Äôs it! This just goes to show that a phone game can have good graphics and run well. I also love all the quests, being able to cook, collect characters and to be able to climb. Super excited for version 1.1!",5
"This is honestly one of the best iOS games I‚Äôve ever played. The graphics are smooth and visually appealing, the musical score is very peaceful and easy to listen to for long periods of time, the world is large and filled with plenty to do, and the game doesn‚Äôt have some ridiculous tutorial that takes an hour to explain very basic mechanics.

The battle system is fun and engaging, and actually allows the player to use some timing and tactics to liven up the fights, unlike so many games these days which just have auto battle, defeating the whole purpose of playing. This game is really well done, and has been very difficult to put down. It also doesn‚Äôt bombard you with ads or in-app purchases. Really outstanding!",5
"The game overall is stunning, beautiful music and scenery and just amazing lore within the game. The only main problem is just how you can‚Äôt say that you will be basing one of the regions of Egypt or India and just make all of the characters white or pale. If you want to make good representation of every region, go further and expand your horizons. Adding more skin tones and more diversity in the game will not only bring more attention to it, but more people to relate to a certain character. Candace was based of a *black* goddess, and she is simply tan in her game design. It doesn‚Äôt make sense, seeing how this is such an amazing company, you all can do better. Not to mention the amount of beauty Indian culture has and with the art style and animations you as a company, you could‚Äôve expressed the beauty of cultures in a new way",3
"This game is absolutely wonderful, the graphics and cutscenes are stunning with the graphics, however the amount of Primogems you can get monthly normally is kind of low which equals to maybe 7 or so wishes if commissions alone and considering the banners go 2 or 3 weeks makes you unable to quickly save any wishes if you want to get the character AND a good weapon from the weapon banner and this being a huge problem for late game players who done everything and unfortunately lose all their 50/50‚Äôs. The way to help this are more primogems from commissions like 15 and 20 when done atleast for unlucky and F2P players like myself. There could also be more things to do in Co-op as the inability to talk to majority of NPC‚Äôs in Co-op is inconvenient.",4
"I love Genshin! I remember how excited I was when I first started playing, exploring Mondstadt and Liyue. The Inazuma update was as stunning and beautiful as the other regions, and I was really looking forward to Sumeru. However, I noticed that many characters were extremely pale and white. Now, why is that a problem? Sumeru is the region based off the middle east/desert. The people who live there should have dark and tanned skin. Making them pale is erasure of what could have been good representation. Also, their outfits contained many themes of orientalism and therefore do not respect the real-life cultures of the middle east/north africa. Genshin was such a wonderful game before this update- I hope that Hoyoverse will at least consider changing things about the characters to be more respectful to the irl people and cultures.",3
"I started playing about a month ago and the game is absolutely STUNNING. Visuals, soundtrack and character designs are all top notch in my opinion! However, I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs very VERY easy to get your world level up while your character‚Äôs are still low level. Right now I‚Äôm struggling to kill the pyro/cryo regisvines and the Oceanids because my characters are about +10 levels lower than the bosses. I love the game but, honestly, it‚Äôs not very first time user friendly. At least, not for me it hasn‚Äôt been. It‚Äôs only been a month in and I‚Äôm already thinking about putting the game down or requesting to start over because I can barely progress like I am. My advice, be sure you know how the game works before picking it up.",4
"this game has rlly got me through a lot, its fun, lots of hot characters, and really the characters are well written, they're just so likeable. if you're f2p like me, yeah even at ar 50, i have very little 5* but ig thats what makes it fun and challenging. u testing out your luck, and skill ? but anyways i really love the storyline and every single playable character i fall in love with. even side characters like npc's or the ""bad guys"" ? i just love everything abt this game. AND THE SCENERY!!1!!1!1!1!1 its absolutely stunning. it sounds stupid, but i rlly just love walking around, looking at everything, and the music is amazing too. the music is probably my favorite thing abt the game as well

tldr, u should get this game, v awesome",5
"First off let‚Äôs get things straight with those 1 stars, stop acting like children just because you lost your 50/50. It‚Äôs not the fricken 
 end of the world alright? Just go farm for primos and wait for a rerun, it‚Äôs not that hard to gain primos so stop acting like kids. But now that part of it is over with, the game is amazing! Great graphics and such pretty characters, people say that characters who are low ranked are bad but not in genshin! All the character are amazing when built right, the game takes a lot of work though so if your willing to use some time to get good at the game then it won‚Äôt be that hard to level up. Anyway thank you Mihoyo for creating this amazing game <3",5
"Hi! So i really love this game! The graphics, bosses, quests, etc. are all AMAZING! But there is one concern that i would like to share with you: So i was doing one of the story quests where you fight Childe and defeat the Ocean thing. When i was on the last monster it lagged on me because i had a bad internet connection. So i exited out of the game and went to switch to a better WiFi network really quick because i didn‚Äôt wanna lose something. When i came back on it took me all the way back to where you had to ask the guide to take you up to the Jade chamber and visit Ningguang. now i feel like i lost my whole account! So please fix this bug sooner or in Version 1.6. But overall this is spectacular.

Many thanks! ~ A traveler",4
"This game is stunning, what‚Äôs more? It‚Äôs all free! The graphics are just gorgeous, almost exact to what you see in the pictures, if not better. I am in live with the unique features in this game, and it‚Äôs really fun to play and explore the many landmarks and parts of the virtual world! But what I would suggest Mihoyo should add in is probably for 100 or more primogems if you lose 50/50, especially if you already have a constellation of that character. Sure, a constellation is super cool but if the player doesn‚Äôt want a constellation or a character from the standard banner. Just a little suggestion! Overall, I would give this a straight solid 5 star rating! Go try it out!",5
"I really love Genshin Impact. It brought me lots of smiles, took away a lot of boredom and money from my pocket. To be honest, the currency is very expensive, but I enjoy it a  lot. The five stars are want to be rare, and if you have to get pity, just know most people who take home every character most likely spent hundreds of dollars or play this game 24/7 in a basement somewhere. The game itself is great, but the entire thing about being 16 gigabytes is a little overwhelming. Sometimes, the screen just becomes static with color for a second, and kicks me out more often than I sit down to play. Overall, it‚Äôs a really great game for being absolutely free, and it‚Äôs worth the gigabytes and time.",5
"This is the game I‚Äôve been looking for all my life it‚Äôs better than everything, but one problem: The wishing system is kinda off and new players to old players- first when you first wish you get so much cool stuff but when you don‚Äôt it‚Äôs kinda sad I‚Äôm not saying to make us get a character every wish in saying make it to where we get characters more often- number 2: the starter players get too spoiled while level like 39-60 players have a hard time getting through other than that... I recommend this too everyone this is my top favorite game! Have an amazing day also zack do ur deep voice again as paimon HAVE A GREAT DAY BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",5
"I started playing this game almost a year ago and in this time I have experience varying eras of this game. At first it was actually really quite pleasant. Each patch they added something the community had asked for, they buffed a character that felt underwhelming to the community, and they even had a road map at the start of the game. 

Now a year later a lot has changed and not all of it was for the better. We no longer have a general idea of the game‚Äôs direction and what new characters are upcoming in a timely manner. The log In rewards we had at the start of every new patch slowly went away, and now even when we ask for minor fixes to characters (not even buffs) we go ignored. 

It‚Äôs a crying shame to see that this is the path this game went after showing so much promise, but I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone. It has a predatory gacha system much worse then traditional gachas, and their marketing ploy is to get people to have buyers remorse/ regret not pulling for a character. 

And to top it all off to reward players who have been playing for a long time they give us absolutely nothing, and  then try to silence us. I will be deleting this game off my devices once if gotten my money‚Äôs worth off the welkin moon and will not be returning unless there are some serious changes.",1
"Gonna keep this one shorter since my last one got removed

Basically the newest story came out of nowhere and was rushed. If you‚Äôve seen Key anime, it‚Äôs like that. Nice beginning. Good character design and music, awful ending with random plot points coming out of no where.

Not to mention them ignoring player feedbacks. Just search up Raiden, Sara, Yoimiya, electro buff, or ‚ÄúBeidou and Raiden‚Äù. all the above characters are weak in game and the company ignores us. Going so much as not letting us comment during a live stream and being emote only. The company has been getting more and more predatory with questionable gaming practices, and then there‚Äôs a community of white knights going ‚Äúoh booba sword‚Äù ‚Äúyummy thighs‚Äù and defending this game. It‚Äôs been just going downhill lately and it seems it will continue. Oh and my last review going into details about one character got removed, so there‚Äôs that.",1
I absolutely love this game. The concept is great and overall the graphics are beautiful. There is only one small issue and that‚Äôs the amount of storage it takes up. I am not sure if the game is too large to be compressed but it‚Äôs getting really hard to play the game as it becomes bigger and bigger. I can‚Äôt even play it on my iPad anymore because I can‚Äôt fit it. On the other hand as of late my phones lag has been terrible and it‚Äôs hindering my ability to play and enjoy the game. I understand if there is no fix to this but I really want to see what this game has in store for me and every other player but at this rate I think I will be unable to do so.,5
"This game is so amazing. The graphics, characters and their backstorys. See I get it ‚Äúoh you spend money on a game just for characters useless.‚Äù It‚Äôs worth it I mean I would spend all my money just for  zhongli just to come home if I can‚Äôt get him with my primogems. And I am ar 50 have almost every character because of spending money and it was worth it üò© So thank you mihoyo for spending time on this AMAZING game truly!!! See I don‚Äôt really get why people hate it, yes people have opinions but some people just see the trailer and be like ‚Äúthat looks stupid‚Äù just try it out you will probably like it but if you tried it and still didn‚Äôt like it that‚Äôs fine. Alright bye bye!!!",5
"Hello,
Although Genshin Impact is a great game, I feel like it should be a little easier to get five stars and level artifacts, for instance we could higher the chances to get five stars by at least just 4%, it would help a lot, as for artifact leveling: being able to use enhancement gems would help a lot, also, I was wondering how to re-roll on five star characters? I got Eula early ( at roll 50 something after getting Diluc ), and to be honest I did not want her, can I change her to Qiqi or something? Nonetheless getting Eula doesn‚Äôt change my opinion on the game, but that‚Äôs all I have to say, good bye! Sorry if this review looks all scattered",5
"This game is so much fun to play and perfect to play while I wait for Breath of the Wild 2, but I‚Äôve been having an issue getting in to the game for the past two days sadly. It usually  gets to the screen where I can click start and play game, but then when it loads it always kicks me out of the app. That‚Äôs been happening every time I try to get into the game, so I‚Äôm really upset about that. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because so many people are downloading it or if maybe it‚Äôs just my phone?? I was having issues with it though where it would glitch in game and wouldn‚Äôt let me switch players and has been freezing up. I don‚Äôt know how to fix it, and I don‚Äôt really want to delete it and have to redownload it because it took about 2 hours just to download.",4
I love this game. Got it March 5th and I‚Äôve been so addicted that I‚Äôm already at rank 30th. If there‚Äôs one thing I would suggest though is making more options to sort in your inventory. Specifically for artifacts. The higher you level up the more things you get and everything has different stats and such. Maybe adding a ‚Äúduplicate‚Äù option would help and then another portion that adds the item name. Like when your going to put artifacts for your character and you can see how many berserkers you have. Why not the same but for duplicates? That‚Äôs just a suggestion. Besides that I‚Äôm loving the game! Super grindy with the gems but it‚Äôs worth it when you get a new character! It‚Äôs so exciting ms,5
"TLDR; Your results may vary. It‚Äôs a fine game if you don‚Äôt mind busywork questing. Maybe with more time it gets better, but it‚Äôs not my job to make me interested in playing :D. 

The game is okay, but I couldn‚Äôt really get into it. The visuals are nice in a clean ‚Äúbreath of the wild‚Äù like style. The characters are fine for standard Anime tropes. The elemental interaction system is a neat feature as well. The problem I have is everything feel like busy work. Walk here do this. Now walk all the way back. Good job, do it again. I spend more time walking and teleporting (when you find warp stones) than anything. The open world is pleasant, but feels empty, and I have no desire to ‚Äúexplore‚Äù it. However, it‚Äôs a free game and for zero dollars you get an open world time killer with a grind you may love or hate. No reason not to give it a spin and see if it‚Äôs your kind of game.",3
All I got to say this is probably the best open world game I ever seen the size of the map and the graphics are incredible for a mobile game and honestly I really wouldn‚Äôt hesitate on spending money in this game the amount of things you can do is impossible like the game gives you so much freedom from the start you can choose from doing the main story or just go out to explore this is just the type of of game I had been looking for it‚Äôs just perfect there‚Äôs not much that I can say only thing would be to add more characters but more than that I surely couldn‚Äôt ask for nothing else I just love this game it‚Äôs just great and I hope that‚Äôd they can keep making it better and better each time !!,5
"I loved this game. I‚Äôm willing to spend every penny.   I love the art, voice, animation, story. Almost everything. This is a game that couldn‚Äôt be compare to the others mobile games. However i felt like this is lacking multiplayer activities. I would love to have a trading systems. Trading materials and swords. It would be nice to have a skin or perhaps wear armors and such. Also Huge raid events with 4+ players join forces to defeat a bigger and harder boss with amazing loot or exclusive items. However the stamina bar is kinda a nuisance. As we level up more I believe our stamina bar should increase as well, Also gliding shouldn‚Äôt require to consume stamina since all you basically do is glide. Please make all these possible. Thank you!",5
"This game is beautiful and so well put together! The graphics are gorgeous and there is no game lag for me when I play! The FPS is high very well. The only thing I have an issue is that whenever the cutscenes load, the audio glitches and cuts out and the animation freezes. Also, when I play the actual game, the water is black and I can only see so far until everything else surrounding the area is just dark. Apparently this has been happening to other people, and I have tested out downloading this game on two different iPads. An older model and a very new model and both problems happen! I don‚Äôt know if this is a mobile game bug or is it not compatible with iPads. Please give me feedback, because I am very excited for this game and it‚Äôd be such a shame for the potential not be fullest when I play!",3
"I‚Äôve put about 8 hours in this game, and so far I‚Äôve enjoyed every minute of it. Whether it‚Äôs the beautiful graphics of the open world, the fluid-like gameplay similar to BotW, or the Gacha system, it has been a pretty awesome experience! People complain about the probability rates of the Gacha system but that‚Äôs how RnG works. 

Now to the part I wanted to complain about, Co-op mode. The main reason I wanted to play this game was to enjoy it with my friends as we progress through the story, however that was all put to a stop once we got to rank 16 (the rank requirement to start co-op). The options were so limited for my friends that I thought they should‚Äôve just left this as a single player game. The only thing they can do is participate in my dungeons, loot materials such as iron chunks, and explore the world with their story progression being halted. I was hoping we would be able to progress through the game together, but that hope sure did get squashed. In the future, I am anticipating some major improvements to the co-op feature to make this game more enjoyable for the player and their friends.

Other than that this game has been a delightful experience

Thank you!",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since yesterday and I haven‚Äôt found the time to stop till now. I am absolutely starstruckü§©with this game, it‚Äôs gameplay is stunning. Also every aspect of this game is immaculate. This is my first and probably only time that I have written a review on any an app, there are literally no word to describe how happy this game has made me. I have been searching and searching for a game to play that I will actually enjoy, and I feel I have that joy in this game thank you so much and I hope to see more games like this in the future. (With the small cons of the long downloading process and and a tiny bit of over heating phone)it‚Äôs the game being an 11/10 for me ‚ú®üíÖüèΩ‚ú® AYOüîä ANYONE SEEING THIS GET THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY IT IS WORTH IT",5
"Bad stuff first: When I first tried to log in to the game it was just a never ending white screen. I had to delete the game then reenter in order to play on my iPad (Key word iPad) but it works perfectly fine on my phone. This is a minor problem for me because I said earlier it‚Äôs on my phone so I can still play just the graphics would be worse trying to fit on a smaller screen. I do hope this bug gets fixed so I can enjoy the lovely graphics
 Now the good stuff:  The graphics are (as stated before) amazing. I love the story, the mini quests, the Temples, the characters designs and voices, the creature designs. All of it! It‚Äôs such an amazing game and I hope many more people will get to enjoy this. 
This was all after a day of playing so I‚Äôm in love with this game :D!",4
"I‚Äôve had this game for a while and not going to lie, the amount of Primogens rewarded with are utterly ridiculous, we get 10 primos every commission, so about 60 primogens a day, so when u do ur commissions for two days straight that‚Äôs not enough for 1 single wish. this game needs to be more free 2 play friendly, not everybody is going to spend their money on a game just to be bored of it in a few years. and the worse thing is the amount of Mora they reward us with, why do we need so much when literally the most things we need with Mora is Leveling, and Buying food. Primos have so much more Value, so you should try considering being a little more generous towards the players. especially those who don‚Äôt spend money.",4
"Miyoho I‚Äôve really wanted Gorou for some time now.
I‚Äôve wished continuously for him yet you won‚Äôt let him come home. I‚Äôve been through so much pain such as loosing all my 50/50‚Äôs and all I ask is for a four star. Is that to much to as for? People may say Gorou has a terrible play style and so on but I think he is amazing! What have a done wrong to not be able to get Gorou, a Geo FOUR STAR for goodness sake. I legit will spend all my money for this man, I‚Äôve wished so much and still nothing. Will you ever give me the chance to get Gorou? All I ask for is for you to give me Gorou, he will make my day so much. Make someone‚Äôs dream come true please. If you see this review LET ME HAVE GOROU.",5
"Honestly this is one of the best games ever I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say negative about this game. This game is as good as ColorfulStage and the quality is awesome. I honestly expected less from this game. You should totally download it. Sadly though it holds a lot of storage so I could only have ColorfulStage and Roblox but whenever I get the chance to I will definitely download it. It is a very fun game and I really wanted Nahida but I couldn‚Äôt get her because of my poor storage after deleting Genshin impact though I have so much storage left over‚Ä¶ I just really wish I had enough storage or download this game.

                       It is an awesome game YOU SHOULD DEFINETLY download it, you won‚Äôt regret it‚Ä¶.",5
"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but I‚Äôm writing one to contrast those that say this game doesn‚Äôt have enough content. I‚Äôve played this game since launch and while I will admit that at launch this game didn‚Äôt have enough content, that is no longer the case. The game currently has 4 major zones, each with their own side quests and zone story to play alongside the main story. During and in-between story arcs, they also have countless events that are usually staggered to be back-to-back with other events. If you‚Äôre getting into the game now, you have an enormous amount of content to choose from and probably won‚Äôt be bored any time soon.",5
"genshin impact is an amazing game. fun mechanics, many characters, a whole bun  vc of places to explore, etc. as a higher leveled player, the only thing i can really do anymore is log in, do commissions, then log off. basically - if you‚Äôre new, don‚Äôt rush the game. it gets a lot less fun when you run out of content. another thing - of course, hoyoverse gets this a lot, but there needs to be more representation for people of color. i love to see rep but in this game we get two characters who have little to no lore. of course this isn‚Äôt TOO big of a deal, but with these things + more, genshin is hanging by a thread on my home screen. i hope this helps newer players get an understanding of how this game is, and i do hope for genshin to grow, since it is a great game. :)",3
"i love the storyline and how the lore is processing, but with sumeru releasing, most of the characters are pale white. you changed your company name to expand globally and make 7 nations all based on different regions but cant even give proper representation?? and even with the characters that are tan, theyre still whitewashed like candace. adding on, characters like kaeya and xinyan are the only 2 playable dark-skinned characters in the game so far yet theyve been whitewashed multiple times too by hoyoverse themselves.
and another note, the wishing system is horrible. if youve played this game you know how frustrating it is to wish. for those that dont know, its most definitely not free to play. you have a 50% chance of getting the limited 5* on the banner within the first 90 wishes but if you lose to a standard character, then you will get that limited 5* character guaranteed. so if you have bad luck, you will get that limited character within 180 wishes. primogems that can be converted to wishes are really time consuming to farm for bc they dont give that much primos in events or rewards. and considering my luck, ive wished on 10 different character banners and i lost on half of them, thus most of them were guaranteed.",2
"This game is literally the best game I have ever played. Some people are complaining about stupid stuff but seriously download this game. It takes up a lot of storage but in my opinion it‚Äôs totally worth it. The faces system maybe needs to be a bit more generous but that just makes getting the character all the more rewarding. The story is amazing, the open world is so expansive, and there‚Äôs so many awesome things to do. Sure, it gets more boring at like AR 55+, but you can still do challenges, events, and explore if you haven‚Äôt done that already. Plus, it‚Äôs always fun to co-op and help out the nee players! If you have any doubts about playing, don‚Äôt. This game is worth it.",5
"Genshin is a really great game. When it was first released, I never really thought much of it. I mean, at that time, I didn‚Äôt really play a ton of games. However, around a year later, I noticed my a large portion of my friends were playing this game. They seemed to be having a great time, so I downloaded it on both mobile and PC. I actually managed to get to AR 50 in the 5 weeks, because of how much I grinded on it. If you ever need any help, just ask your friends. Co-op IS an option, which makes the experience more enjoyable. If you want to play a game, this is definitely one for you. Only issue I have is how much storage it takes up, but it‚Äôs not to bad.",5
"I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how much I love this game. I haven‚Äôt even been playing for a year but I feel like I‚Äôve played this game my whole life. The scenery, characters, and music all tie together to make a fun and perfect game. Even when i find myself with no resin and feel i have nothing to do, i always find something. I know theyve put so much effort into everything, the detail, all of the puzzles, (etc.)!!  This game is so fun and I‚Äôm even finding out big tips about the game almost everyday which make it so interesting. Theres always new events and new quests so its never boring. This game overall is just so fun and the best game I think I‚Äôve ever played.",5
I just want to say I love this game and I‚Äôve been playing since like last November and I‚Äôve had extraordinary experience playing this game but there was just one issue and that was playing on iPod. So I have an iPad Pro and an iPhone 12 that I play genshin impact on and it works perfectly fine but when I play on my iPod touch (6th gen ) it doesn‚Äôt load for some reason. It‚Äôs on iOS 12.5.5 but it I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something internally or something to do with the game. I was wondering if there‚Äôs anyway I can stop my game from crash or whatever is happening but ya that kinda it. I love your game though. Also good luck to People who are pulling for Yae Miko.üëç( Ar50),5
"This game has what makes every rpg game amazing. The character designs are beautiful, the story is intriguing, and the game play is very easy to handle. Although I wish there was an easier way to get new characters, but I understand why it was done, and doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience. Probably the best part is the way the game is programmed/ designed, the mechanics are so addicting, and the combat is so much fun. Another thing are the characters, you can get attached to them very easily, and I love how characters come out as you progress in the story. Most rpg‚Äôs just have the characters out before you could even know who they are. 

In summary, 
10/10 would recommend",5
"I have lots of fun playing this game. Me and my friends play it together and have lots of fun, on PC‚Ä¶ On mobile it crashes a lot and takes up a lot of storage, which I understand can be hard to control but this game is extremely big. The other thing is that you can‚Äôt pay for in app purchases on PC if you start on mobile. I first downloaded the game about a year ago on my phone and quickly switched to my PC because of the storage and crashing. Then to figure out a few months later when I was going to spend money on the game that I couldn‚Äôt use my PC to do so because I started playing on my phone. If you could make it so that I could pay on PC if I started on phone then my opinion of this game would significantly improve.",3
"The game is great and enjoyable, its my favorite rpg gacha game. There are a few flaws to it though

1. To claim the adeventure ranks prizes you have to walk all the way back to the village which is quite annoying. It would be nice if there were something on the screen you could use to claim it
2. Sometimes i agree to do a quest but then realize i cant fight the boss because its too strong for my level, it would be nice if there were a thing that if a boss is atleast 5 levels higher than you you get to pick an extra character to help. Or there be a way to quite the quest because i was stuck on a quest and ended making a new account because of it",5
"I have spent over $1000 on this game. I look back at some of my purchases and I do reflect on how my journey has been amazing. I will continue playing this game as I have already invested too much money and time to quit. HOWEVER, this most recent sequence of events regarding greed by the company has shown to us that there is a current lack of organization within the company. There is an even greater lack of communication between the player base and management team. Community managers seem absent and content creators are the only liaison between the players and the developers. I will only invest a $5 welkins pass from this point on forward rather than my previous investments of gem packs in hopes that maybe our voices will be heard. We miss the OLD Genshin impact that promotes this game and acted in a generous and communicative way.",2
"This game was once something I was extremely excited to play, the world is magical and extremely interesting but after a while you‚Äôll learn to realize theres not much there and you have to grind heavily to find it, then all the cool characters you encounter are locked behind a summon system which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you could actually earn a decent amount of materials to summon at a steady basis but mihoyo has made sure that you NEED to spend money to get anything you want. You would think for the one year anniversary they would give you some form of celebration right? Well no only 1000 players receive 100 primo gems which you need 160 to summon one time with a minuscule chance that summon will be anything other than a 3 star weapon. I loved this game and it saddens me to see the direction it‚Äôs going in, hopefully mihoyo learns from the current outrage and actually throws the players a bone for once.",1
"We LOVE Genshin. BUT we were recently logged off accidentally and are now unable to log back in due to ‚Äúpoor network quality‚Äô‚Äù this is crazy because we were able to log in to the same account on a different device on the same network. (I would continue to allow my daughter to use this device if it weren‚Äôt needed for work) After reaching out to the developer via email and receiving no response, we resorted to the internet and have tried everything from deleting app, resigning in, upgrading WiFi service in house and resetting an iPad to factory settings. Still, my work iPhone is the only device that doesn‚Äôt get the poor network quality message. Rather upsetting as we have spent hundreds of dollars for in app purchases on this game. I would give the game 5 stars if this hadn‚Äôt happened.",2
This game is so fun and super cool!! This made me play the game all night also this game is swaggy and the character designs and powers are so crazy it‚Äôs so good omg- Also the voice actors are really good brings the game to live while your playing as your character. Another fun thing is you could pick if you wanna be the boy or the girl and then you name your character and Paimon is so cute and same with Amber! The characters are awesome. Also the animations are so good don‚Äôt even get me started!! The only thing that bugged me was how long the downloads are like it took ten minutes to download and then like about 20-30 minutes for this thing to download in the app but it‚Äôs worth it tbh! all I gotta say is GET THE APP NOW! >_<,5
"This game is quite good, the story, the characters, etc. but it is SO hard to get any character you want without spending like hundreds of dollars, they need to put down the pricing a bit. It is really difficult to play for free, I try but I can‚Äôt get any character and waste all the primos I‚Äôve saved up for like a week. Another thing, because I don‚Äôt spend money, bosses are like impossible, I‚Äôm talking about the flower ones. Because I don‚Äôt spend any money, I can‚Äôt get any good characters to fight them. I still am a low rank but it‚Äôs still really hard. On a more positive note, I can‚Äôt wait to see the future updates, I would love more leaf types (I forgot what it‚Äôs called) and a pyro traveler, and genuinely where the story ends up too.",4
"When the game is going well it‚Äôs so enjoyable! There‚Äôs a ton to do and the style is beautiful! I genuinely enjoy this game but there are major flaws to the point that I‚Äôm considering quitting. 

For instance, the secrets of tianquin quest is a random quest that is almost impossible for people to beat unless your world level is still low (look online and see for yourself). That wouldn‚Äôt normally be an issue but it will lock you out of coop mode indefinitely until you beat it. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way to back out of the quest if you accidentally start it. This isn‚Äôt a new issue, it‚Äôs been reported to mihiyo well over a year ago and they‚Äôve done nothing to help, leaving a ridiculous amount of people locked out of coop mode. 

Btw, before you say to yourself ‚Äújust git gud‚Äù, this quest I mentioned is notably harder than any boss fight I‚Äôve experienced in the game. It wasn‚Äôt play tested enough.",1
"Genshin Impact is one of the most fun rpg games I‚Äôve played in a very long while. The variety of characters and their abilities is extensive (though the gacha system is as dangerous as ever), combat is fast paced- generally what you‚Äôd expect to sum it up. I love the story, and playing through it is thrilling... when the game lets me play. One of the most frustrating things for me in ANY game is a level block. After you finish a story quest, you can‚Äôt progress further until you reach a certain level, and the slow level progression is aggravating. The game is fun enough for me to keep playing despite having to grind after every quest, but if you have little patience and prefer speed-runs, this is not the game for you.",4
"Honestly, at first I thought it was a BOTW copy, but once you get past the first bit, the story completely changes! I love to play and it combines many different types of games. For example, it has a collecting part to it (with the characters), an adventure theme, it also has a Battle Pass, and soon they‚Äôll be a housing part of the game to it in the 1.5 update! There‚Äôs so much to do in this game, and still not a lot of the actual game is out! Plus, it‚Äôs free! There‚Äôs also co-op mode, which makes it TWICE AS BETTER! You can team up against bosses, explore together, or just mess around and have fun! There‚Äôs also SO many other small quests! Please get it, I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt regret it.",5
"When doing domains, there should be a prompt where it asks if you want to leave and if you are sure because as I was fighting the abyss, I didn‚Äôt know I was going to kill it within the next move. I pressed the attack button via PS4 controller and then exited the domain. :/ so basically I lost a chest and it‚Äôs annoying. There is no way to get it back I guess. This is an issue that I‚Äôve seen people write in other forums as well, so I know it wasn‚Äôt just me. It would just be courteous to have that extra prompt or have the domain exit not where the fighting is. It really makes all the grinding to level up and get strong kind of not worth it when you don‚Äôt get the chest that you worked so hard for.",4
"I am AR 56, that much I‚Äôll say. In the beginning I had so much to do, I had a lot of story and lore and I covered so much that I no longer have anywhere else to explore. I am very excited for the Sumuru update, where they will release a new region, new puzzles as well as characters. But I know that as soon as the update comes out, it‚Äôll will end quickly. As a endgame player I‚Äôd like more things to do, I don‚Äôt want to be farming for characters all the time, it gets tiring after a while. I still play the game regularly, after work I like spending my time helping other people in co-op but that‚Äôs about it. For those who are just starting out the game, don‚Äôt rush. The story is amazing, I recommend taking it slowly.",4
"So I was playing this game recently and I actually had a problem so the first problem is that the character is laggy and the next problem is the small girl right next to us at the start why does she
Leave us? The next one is I was at the waterfall and while I was in the water I went to the shore are I drowned and I don‚Äôt know why? The next is while I was on the top mountain I fell and died.. I want you to remove it because I don‚Äôt like it the next is while I was playing for a bit the small girl came back and while I was with her she saw a statue and I went there because i didn‚Äôt know what was going on so I went and I had to fight these blobs and I deleted the game and redownload it then I had to Fight them AGAIN I repeated it 3 times I had to fight them MORE and it wouldn‚Äôt stop I tried to escape it had a black screen and it took me BACK I still had to fight the blobs it wouldn‚Äôt stop so, that‚Äôs all bye",1
"When this game originally came out, I wasn‚Äôt able to access my PC for a couple days, meaning I had to play on phone. As I saw that it barely fit within the phone recommended model (8+), I prepared myself for a lag fest. But suprisingly, it didn‚Äôt lag at all! Granted, it caps out at 30 FPS, but I honestly could care less, since 30 and 60 look similar to me. When I went to play it on PC, my computer sounded like a turbine engine, and the game would frequently lag at medium settings. So, I‚Äôve probably played the mobile version more than the PC version. 
Aside from the anecdote, the gameplay is great, and any fans of open world games have to give this a shot, PC, PS4, or Mobile.",5
"This game is quite literally everything I‚Äôve wanted in an RPG for ages. It has the potential to set the standard for years to come. Graphics, combat, soundtrack, story, everything is spot on. The downside is the mobile based gacha system of micro-transactions that will frustrate you and tempt you more than any game before it to spend $$$. If not for characters and gear, than for more ‚Äúresin‚Äù (energy to complete actions). Let me be clear though, you don‚Äôt have to spend anything to enjoy this game. That said, if you don‚Äôt, you WILL miss out on any number of things, and regardless of what you‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs OK. The game is still fantastic at its core, and designed for successful progression whether you spend or not.",5
"I didn‚Äôt know this kind of game was possible for a mobile game. The world, characters, weapons, and elements/abilities are 10/10 amazing. My only wish is that there was an easier way to get fates for more wishes. They are really hard to get without spending a lot of real money. After playing this game for a couple months it‚Äôs honestly the best game I‚Äôve ever played. I really really would like more characters and old character skins along with new weapons and regions to explore. The hardest part is waiting for more. When theres an update we only get 1-2 new characters and then have to wait longer. Please drop 4 at once so there is diversity in our teams and many ways to play.",5
"Ok this game is THE BEST role playing game in ios ever. Some say its a botw clone, but for me that‚Äôs good since it was a great game. I absolutely LOVE IT, and when I summoned more than a month‚Äôs worth of hard earned 3500 Primogems (the ingame currency), i got absolutely nothing. All i got were trash weapons and one duplicate hero. It honestly needs to be fixed, because I‚Äôve seen people waste hundreds of dollars on summoning and not even get a gold hero. If you this doesn‚Äôt matter to you and you just want to play and not summon, then go for it, but i quit because i know that if i keep playing this gatcha game i would just get depressed for not getting a new good character after a month of playing.",5
This game is one of few mobile games that you can play for hours on end and not get bored and as many people have said it lags but it‚Äôs a if game with great graphics so you have to expect something but what I don‚Äôt like isn‚Äôt something major it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt really get the adventure level and exp system and that‚Äôs probably just me but I find myself getting stuck and not being able to do quests or continue the story cause i can‚Äôt bring my adventure level there is nothing wrong with the game itself it‚Äôs amazing just the adventure level to me is a bit stunting other than that the game is a amazing (and tips on gaining my adventure level in stucküòÇ),5
"I doubt the developers will read this let alone a reply, and if they do, let‚Äôs just say it would really make my day. Sometimes I spend more than 12 hours on this game a day, even when I have to work but that‚Äôs just to say the least I was wondering, is there anyway that we can design our wings or purchase or upgrade our wings? I would love. To be able to have different wings to go along with my weapons it was just a thought. I‚Äôm not sure if you guys actually thought about this or if it is available in the game I haven‚Äôt seen it overall this is the only thing that I ever spend time on I love this game a little too much thank you guys.",5
"I‚Äôm not even sure where to start. I started playing Genshin Impact shortly after it came out. I play everyday and it‚Äôs easily my favorite game. I love the main storyline that we follow, it‚Äôs amazing. There are so many places to explore and new people to meet in and out of game. Even at the start of the game until now, there are a ton of things to do in game. Always updated with new stories, quests, and fun events to do. I play on both PS4 and mobile. Both gameplays are excellent, but note, it‚Äôs takes up a ton of storage on mobile phones, but regardless still the best game I‚Äôve played myself. Definitely worth trying out if you‚Äôre a fan of adventure and story games.",5
"It‚Äôs known that Genshin Impact‚Äôs regions are based on countries in the real world. Mondstadt is based on German culture, Liyue is based on Chinese culture, and Inazuma is based on Japanese culture. The upcoming nation, Sumeru, is rumored to be based on Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and North African cultures, yet rumors, leaks, and speculations about the game have shown that there are a lack of darker toned characters. In my opinion, to have a game based on real-life countries and yet only have not even a variety of skin tones is completely outrageous and unrealistic to the real world. The lack thereof doesn‚Äôt only make the people (npcs & playable characters) have limited designs and seem repetitive, it also causes an increase of anti-
blackness and colorism within the fandom. Change needs to be made, characters need to be more diverse for many more reasons than I have stated. To be a multi-million dollar company and yet not listen to the fan base is completely wrong.",1
"Genshin impact is such an incredible game. the characters are complex and with their own backstory to each of them, the attacks and enemies are amazing, and thats not even taking in the exquisite details that are put into every square inch of the game. There are hundreds of books which have been written, food that i wish i could eat, even the shingles of the houses are a work of art. And in addition to this, they are constantly workin on new updates which they put out every month!! And did I mention the music and voice acting?? there are beautiful cities that are based each off of a place and have their own culture and beliefs.",5
This is one of my only favorite games out there its comforting and very calming i love playing it every day even if i have nothing to do some people complain about not gettin 50 wishes and their primos but honestly all they care about is the gacha. i cant stand some people who put 1 star just bc of the anniversary rewards. i think the anniversary was great! i also loved the theater mini event thingy it was very cute! this game has helped me through so much and has gotten me out of my darkest times when nobody was there and when it was my birthday the characters were the only ones that made my day so much better! thank you for trying to make it an enjoyable game for everyone ^-^,5
"Wow! Like, I struggle to believe it‚Äôs free to play, because it is so fun and addictive. The story quests are engaging, the daily commissions keep you committed to logging on every day, and the best part is, to get characters, you don‚Äôt HAVE to pay real money! Most other games I play, when they want to to obtain new material, you have to use a special currency in the game that, to have, requires a payment, but I was so surprised when Genshin was letting you get that currency (primogems) from doing quests! Honestly, the whole wishing system is fun and unpredictable. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes either anime or story games or fighting games! It‚Äôs really the bomb !",5
"The games visuals are amazing but the company doesn‚Äôt care for their players, for example as I have been playing since almost the games start I can say that the higher you level the less rewards you get. Along with that the anniversary rewards were horrible, your players have been devoted to playing and enjoying your game some even spending money tirelessly to get the characters you produce, while the company gives us players nothing but dirt in return. The game is amazing but mihoyo ruined it. (Ok but also like how/why are honkai players(you guys are great) getting showered with rewards while we have to pay for any daily rewards at all?[yes commissions are daily rewards but honkai players get daily rewards without lifting a finger] )",3
"This game is absolutely stunning when it comes to graphics and art! 
The gameplay is really smooth, the storyline is interesting, and the characters look amazing, they each have their own abilities. I legit have nothing to complain about when it comes to this game. It is very high quality when it comes to a mobile game and I don‚Äôt regret downloading it! The developers really did pay attention to detail when making it and I appreciate it. There is a lot to explore and the game will probably kill a lot of boring time (and your phone battery) which is a good source of entertainment. 

And the fact that this game is free makes it all the more amazing! ‚ú®

Also I can‚Äôt help but think that this game is really similar to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch. So I would say that this is a decent alternative if you can‚Äôt afford Breath of the Wild.

I would suggest that you make a lot of room on your phone before downloading the full version of the game. It does take up quite a bit of space and it would be annoying if the game was slow.",5
"I got this game over a month ago and it‚Äôs been very addicting. One thing that annoys me is that genshin will crash every 5 minutes. I also experience horrible lag when fighting monsters. Ever since the 2.0 update, the lag and crashing has only gotten worse. Crashing seems to happen more often when I check the map, teleport, or go in co-op. The worst part is when i crash when I‚Äôm fighting and have to restart, or when I‚Äôm in a timed challenge and start lagging, because every time I lag I lose about 4 seconds. I‚Äôve tried everything I‚Äôve seen online to fix the crashing and lag, and nothing has worked. I have an iPad, and all my other games don‚Äôt crash and run fine. It‚Äôs only genshin.",4
"I love this game so much; it‚Äôs literally the best. I could want nothing more out of it yet it somehow always surprises me in the best ways. The ideas are great, and you‚Äôll never run out of things to do. Kudos to that. I have no complaints whatsoever‚Ä¶ or, at least, I had. I‚Äôve lost the ability to change my name and/or signature. Now everyone thinks I‚Äôm always online. The game could have warned us about it, but I don‚Äôt remember getting mail about it. I‚Äôm strongly dissatisfied with this update and don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt change my name. I feel like this was sudden and that I was additionally unprepared- the worst possible combo I could have had. I would really appreciate if the game added that back. Thank you for your time.",4
"I love this game, but it crashes so much on tablet that it‚Äôs actually impossible for me to complete some quests. There are multiple times when I‚Äôve been unable to complete my commissions for the day because the game crashes and resets my progress every time. 

I usually don‚Äôt mind the constant crashing‚Äîits fast enough to just start the game again, but when the crashes get in the way of the actual gameplay it‚Äôs infuriating. I‚Äôve been unable to advance in the story quest for almost a week now because I cannot progress past a cutscene without crashing and having to start it all over. 

This is deeply frustrating because currently this is my favorite game and I love everything else about it.",4
"Overall this game is phenomenal! The art, and just dedication is what really brings out the extraordinary gameplay. But, the summoning for five stars. This is really the only complaint I have. The rates for 5 stars (just one) can be under .600%! I‚Äôve seen people blow off hundreds of dollars just to get maybe one five star. For a free to play player like myself, this takes away a lot of the excitement when a new banner comes up. It‚Äôs so devastating that people have to make new accounts again and again just because they can‚Äôt spend money. Just general advice, you should make the percentage higher, or at least make a guaranteed five star pull for beginners. The whole game is great, but the constant reliance on recharging to get a good game play ruins that, and makes it less enjoyable.",4
Ok so... why are people forced to make an account? I just wanted to play this game (btw it looks pretty good..). You are kinda like Pok√©mon forcing people to make an account. but tbh I just want to play this great looking game. PLEASE LET PEOPLE PLAY AS GUEST!!!! I just want to play. Thank you for reading! :) (oh this is a edit btw!) Sky children is a lot better and doesn‚Äôt make you log in / make a new account. It is kinda sad that a 3D puzzle game (I think?) is a lot better then this. But you could just add guest accounts then I would be able to play. And as others are saying IT IS TO LAGGY. Fix that then they would be able to play. Also somebody said they got hacked and the hacker changed the email. (This is how to fix that hacking problem!) before somebody logs in they have to do something like put in a smiley face or draw a sock or something like that! (This is one of the longest reviews I have ever made). Anyways thank you for reading (again.)! Goodbye.,1
"Best game I had ever seen in a long time if you think Zelda breath of the wild this is the game for you.  My heck it is identical not in a way were it‚Äôs a bad and not fun but they have some what a paraglide, the way they climb üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, and the weapons, the way they look.  It‚Äôs a aid king game.  There are no bad thing as a professional game player I will not tell who I am.  The game is a master peace great job.  One thing the game is amazing but I would like the game to have üêé or animals you can tame like wolves into dogs or something.  And then I would like to be able to have my own house üè†.  And then I would really like it if you would  explain how to do stuff like the dragon I can‚Äôt get pass it.  Any way I really like the game like I loathe the game.  I love it good job üëè.",5
I love this so much finally it opened I love how the NPC look and everything looks problem is it kicks me out of the game sometimes and when it like venti was telling the story like that(sorry don‚Äôt know how to explain it) it get stuck it doesn‚Äôt move anymore even though you can still hear it I love the game it amazing it better than the other games I played it cool love playing it even though I‚Äôm stuck at the defeated the ruins guard to get the tears of stormterror but the doesn‚Äôt stop me of playing that game I recommend this game and the other one Honkai  impact 3rd both are good games + it be cool if sometimes NPC appeared and help you beat the monster when you need it + it be cool to have magical pets that help you in battlesüëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING! THE GRAPHICS, CHARACTER DESIGNS, VOICES, STORIES, CHARACTER IDLES SND JUST EVERY SINGLE THING! THE GACHA SYSTEM (kinda) but the reason this review is a 4 star, is because. The farming. As a person with screen time, it‚Äôs very hard to farm at least 40 primos in 30 minutes, which is kinda sad bc in other games I could get 100 gems or whatever in like 20 minutes? It‚Äôs kinda unfair cause this game is basically forcing players to play more to get more primo gems, to of course, wish or do other stuff. Since it‚Äôs very important, why is it so hard to farm? Other than that, this game is very amazing!

EDIT! i don‚Äôt have screen time anymore. but the way hyv treats their players is bad.. to bad i‚Äôm hyperfixated on this silly ahh game ‚Ä¶ please treat us better with more rewards,!",4
I real glide the whole few of this game how smooth is plays on mobile as well as on my pc and ps4 which I plan on as well. From story to graphics to combat all feel amazing. The only thing I have to say against this game is its pay wall to get the hurt tier characters that make pulling off combo interactions easier and more fluid than trying to set fire with a charged shot on amber to then swap to Lisa to the MC vs razor to diluc to MC or qiqi needs a better way to obtain new characters rather through micro transaction possibly lower the AR requirement to do the people‚Äôs choice character to level 10 not 20 by the time you hit 20 you‚Äôd have already beat main story and no point grinding for the challenge toon other Than to say oh finally got it.,5
"This game is lovable for all! But, the Event Gacha is a problem. The Gacha costs things called ‚ÄúPrimogems.‚Äù When starting the game you might realize that getting these primos would actually take awhile. Every 10 pull is 1600 primogems if you multiply that buy 9 it would be 14,400 primogems. (Every 90 pulls is guaranteed a 5 star.) - You would need to get 14,400 primogems to get a guaranteed 5 star that might actually end up being a different character (Called a ‚ÄúStandard character‚Äù) - that you spent so much time grinding for which is honestly stupid and should get a small fix. Overall, this game is fun, has a great story line, has very detailed and creative character designs, the graphics are well done! (Not counting the Event Gachaüòí) Great job developers! :D",4
"The game is really good, but there is a few problems.
Firstly, the creators are problematic. The creators are pretty racist, in the official art they change the darker characters skin to a lighter skin on purpose. Another problem is how long the updates take, we have the same region for about 10 months. So basically it takes them 10 months to create a new region and archon quest, and the archon quests are already there when the region comes out. So you have to wait like 9 months for another region in conclusion. Another problem is the censoring chat, in the game whenever your in co-op, there‚Äôs been multiple problems where predators are asking minors where they live, their age, etc. and it never gets censored.",4
"I love this game! Downloaded it on my PC and it‚Äôs awesome. Just one problem.. The game is a lot of storage. That bugs me, But other than that this game has lots of things to do, also very pretty, and very fun! I love all the character designs too. Very challenging but that‚Äôs what makes it even MORE fun to play! This storyline is so interesting and some cutscenes are so intense! I started playing a year ago and I‚Äôm AR 52. I‚Äôve been saving for Kazuha for a while! Overall, this game is fantastic. Update a few months later, hello! I‚Äôm ar 55 and the game has gotten a bit boring. I‚Äôm saving for ayaka and she hasn‚Äôt gotten a banner for a while. The game is definitely a money trap, and you should make more black/blasian characters. Otherwise, I do the same thing everyday day. Daily commissions, spend resin, then log out.",3
This game has so much to offer from all the new places to explore to the story and to the characters. I absolutely recommend this game if you have any free time or just the most time in the world get this game it takes a lot of your storage but for me it‚Äôs worth it. I asked all of my friends to download the game and it‚Äôs gotten me through some of the toughest moments. Do you know what even my phone screens are just pictures of the characters that‚Äôs how much I love this game characters and stories it is so much to take in but it‚Äôs so fun to play. So if you want some thing fun that will take up time this is the game and I mean this.,5
"Though over time it gets boring, the moment you start playing it again, it‚Äôs great! This is a great time waster but it really makes one feel like they‚Äôre inside the world. A person also doesn‚Äôt have to grind twenty four seven- this game was actually originally made to be casually played which is also why it starts to get boring if you play for eight hours straight.
For those wanting something to take their mind off work, this is truly a great game. However if you want to only care little about a game, then this is not it as one could never stop thinking about it once they play.
Overall, I recommend it!",5
"So my friends have played this game, I didn‚Äôt understand the hype. It took a huge chunk of my storage but little did I know that this would be the best game ever! It runs so smoothly, no lag, great graphics and the characters ARE SO CUTE!! Paimon is cutest and the cinematic style is perfect! It requires technical thinking so don‚Äôt be upset when you can‚Äôt pass hard levels! If you‚Äôre a quick learner and you have a LOT (you need a LOT) of time then this is the perfect game for you. It‚Äôs really good on mobile and console, I‚Äôve used mobile so far! If there is any lag, it has to do with your device, NOT the game. I still can‚Äôt believe this game is free for how much it offers.",5
"They made a region based on the middle east but won't even represent at least half of the characters properly? Like the newest archon they're releasing is supposedly based off of Kusanali Jataka and Saraswati but the only thing Kusanali took from them is their supposed skin color and wisdom. She looks like a westernized forest elf, like she could be Klee's cousin or something. If they were going to make her pale, then they should've made her clothes more culturally significant. A simple bangle and bodhi leaves does not cover that. I don't think I even need to go into detail about Dori. How are you going to be orientalist as an Asian company? The colorism is also holding the character designs back. Take one look at Tighnari and tell me he wasn't designed to have tanned skin, he's literally outside all day. The character design team is doing so bad right now. It is so bad. I wanna give you a zero, but that's not possible. So I give you a one.",1
"I would give it a 0 rating if I could. I am EXTREMELY upset to find that when I logged into Genshin Impact I was met with the very beginning scene, the start of it all. I wasn‚Äôt barely starting I have an account already thats level 30 something I believe but unfortunately i can‚Äôt log back into it. I REFUSE TO LOSE MY PRECIOUS XIANGLING üòî I WANT TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS ASAP. I cannot believe that on the one day I decided to get on and finally start playing this rather lovely game once again, I was truly disappointed and shocked. I am very much ranting. I don‚Äôt deserve this to happen to me üòî My pulls.. my SWEAT AND TEARS.. my TIME.. all for THIS?üíî I have no words I am grieving my loss, I deleted genshin impact and re-downloaded it But I am currently waiting until the download of the ‚Äúfull package‚Äù has been completed.

"Hoyoverse after having almost every character have the same skinny anime character body and face shape with skin tones that are LIGHTER THAN MINE (i‚Äôm white) and completely unrealistic for actual people, even in areas that are meant to be based off of southeast Asia and northern Africa (areas of the world where more people have darker skin tones), and making the only 2 out of 40+ characters that have darker skin still extremely pale, one of them is described as ‚Äúexotic‚Äù and ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù, the other is ‚Äúscary‚Äù and ‚Äúthreatening‚Äù, and still expecting people to not notice/care, especially when said characters are constantly lightened in official artwork, and to pay 100+ USD for the 50/50 chance of pulling a character in their game, when they are an extremely rich company that could easily add diversity to their characters but they still refuse to out of fear of losing money from racist/colorist players:",1
I think your game is unfair to the players. The monsters you have to fight can get full health when ever you get knocked out of a certain area. You level up one level the monsters Level up 50. You want us to buy these packs so we can upgrade. What‚Äôs the use of having a game that favors the creatures you fight instead of the player. I‚Äôve played a lot of games just like this and never have I had one that cheats so much or gives the creatures the advantage. You need to fix this problem because every time I get knocked out of a play area I have to go back and start all over from the beginning with the monster. That‚Äôs a load of bull. Why does the monster get to regenerate health and I have to go into my bag while I‚Äôm getting hit. There is no way to win. I think your game is set up so you have to pay to win and I‚Äôm not spending money on a game where the creatures have the advantage,1
"All the bad review I see are people having no storage, not getting the characters they wanted, satire, or people complaining it‚Äôs a rip off of BOTW. the devs said they were inspired by BOTW first of all, and secondly, it‚Äôs a gacha game. So many people are whining about how it‚Äôs a cash grab or too hard, if you have an issue with gambling, maybe don‚Äôt play? Overall I enjoy it to the most part, it‚Äôs a game, not a chore or a task. If you genuinely can‚Äôt handle it, don‚Äôt play, that simple. I love the characters and world stories, but I will say outside of in game quests and characters story‚Äôs, there isn‚Äôt much to do. More will come soon though, so I‚Äôm not too worried.",5
"So I have been playing this game for quite a while, and it is fantastic. So far it‚Äôs really good, but the rewards aren‚Äôt it. For the anniversary tomorrow, we are getting 10 wishes. I shouldn‚Äôt sound greedy saying this but really I expected something more exciting. And for the codes. Only like 50 primogems and 10k+ mora. I wouldn't say that would be really fair. I mean a lot of us really like the gacha but if we are just getting a literal weapon that we probably won‚Äôt use then it‚Äôs pretty much useless. I know it mostly relies on pity but I‚Äôm being honest. And for competitions for fanart or something, 100 primogems and 100,000+ mora. Since a lot of people are participating maybe you should up the rewards a bit to make it more exciting. Thanks!",4
"It‚Äôs a great game, a lot of kids are rating it 1 star because of the rewards and the rewards are ok, they could‚Äôve been better but aside from that, Genshin is really good, open world rpg, lots of characters to choose from, you can meet friends and have a lot of fun. Some people don‚Äôt play Genshin for the rewards, they play it for the thrill and excitement, the little kids are just pressed because of the poor rewards which is understandable but they are being a bit dramatic. It‚Äôs YOUR choice to spend money on the game, and it‚Äôs THEIR game. They can give you however much rewards that they want. Imagine if this backfires and they don‚Äôt give us anything at all. What then?",5
"I love genshin man, im ar56 and have only missed 2 days since i started playing (1/4/21) and it's so much fun. There's so much to explore and do, and the characters are super cool. I'm always trying to get new ones, and the welkin and bp are great for getting characters and super cheap as well, only an hour of work to pay for both. I even have multiple accounts! It's just so much fun, and collecting all the characters, name cards, achievements, and all the weapons is so much fun. I love making art of the characters and even making my own! I'm in love with the storyline and as soon as i unlock a new archon quest i'm right to finishing it as soon as possible. absolutely love this game!",5
"I absolutely love this game, it‚Äôs so fun! Sadly I do have a few problems. I hate the fact you can‚Äôt get any of the event characters after their banner. I really wanted Klee, but I started the day after her banner. I really wish they would release the characters in different banners, maybe add a new one with special 5 stars that switch out every week or so? Or maybe like on Christmas we all could pick a 5 star we wanted that‚Äôs not available anymore, like a Christmas gift or something, I dunno. Another thing I have a problem with is the lag. I have to play it on my iPhone since I don‚Äôt have a ps4, and it‚Äôs incredibly laggy. It takes several minutes just to load up the game, and when it loads it glitches and freezes all the time.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for a while now although this game has too many glitches. I was guaranteed a five star but then it crashed and I didn‚Äôt even get my summon token back, I lost a four star and it was guaranteed one because I saw the purple but then it crashed. It always crashes and it takes forever to get back on. Overall, pretty laggy game, and HORRIBLE customer service. You guys don‚Äôt even respond anymore. I wrote mine a month and a half ago about the five star glitch and you guys still haven‚Äôt wrote back. I spent so much money only for so many glitches to happen. I‚Äôm switching to Publishing: Gray Raven unless you guys can fix these glitches.",5
Heyy I just wanted to ask when genshin impact on the switch was gonna be a thing because genshin impact won‚Äôt work on my phone and I don‚Äôt have a PC or a PS4 so I was hoping it would come out soon because if it did I could play it on there without having to worry of it kicking me out each time I wanna play I also really like the new characters that you guys just added but I‚Äôm sad I cant get them because I keep getting kicked out of my game and I really do wanna wish for it- over all this is really a good game to take my mind off of things I just hope that genshin impact on the switch will be out soon so I can get to playing this game again!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"So i download this game a first time and immediately fell out and deleted it, but later on i thought it would be fun to get it again. i was 100% right. i knew it took up a lot of storage, but for a game with so many characters, great graphics, a exceptional story line, and a co-op feature it's amazing and totally worth it. Ive played for hours on end made friends and bonded over this game. There is one complaint though. The system which gives you characters is extremely unlucky and many free to play gamers cant get event characters because of how unlucky it is. Overall it's an amazing game and i love it if you're debating on getting it and reading this now go ahead and download it <3",5
"The first few hours are nice. There are some very well done mechanics and it is a very good open world for a mobile game.
Then the gacha gets you.
At higher levels every aspect of the game forces you towards spending money.
At Adventure Level 45, there is maybe 20 minutes of content a day, while loot is meager. 
The resin system limits all aspects of player and gear improvement. Spending money or not playing are the only options. Spending a LOT of money. 
You are forced to only level a character or two at a time because it will take months to level all of them, or you can spend money.
Rolling for characters is deceptive. To actually get all of the features, you must successfully roll for a specific character 7 times (6 for the free ones). A couple recent characters were not great until you rolled them a couple times. 
The combination of all the intentional limits on loot and character progression turns this from a good game to a horrible money grab. 
The character banner events successfully use ‚Äúfear of missing out‚Äù to coerce spending because normal drop rate for anything but low level junk weapons miniscule. 
It was probably an early sign that this game was predatory when many people started and abandoned accounts when their free initial rolls failed to produce the first good characters.",1
I want to start off and say that the game play is beautiful and well thought out. As far as the game itself I liked it. But downloading it was already a lot of space. 2-3 GB + and additional 8GB after the Demo. Then after about a week of having it on my phone.. nothing on my phone would work. So I went to investigate... peviously I had only been using 95GB total worth of storage and phone functioning space... all of a sudden I was using 200.5 GB worth of space and my phone was heating up and crashing all the time and it was burning my iPhone battery. I deleted the app. Immediately my phone went down to 100GB worth of space. I was looking forward to playing this game but it‚Äôs unrealistic and sad for it to burn my iPhone XS like this üò¢. If there is a further update that fixes this feature I will reconsider.,3
"I first started playing this game in what I think was June of 2021. I still miss that feeling of amazement and wonder while exploring Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma. Now, Sumeru has arrived and I don't know if my phone will have enough storage. I've deleted over 200 photos, deleted my notes app (which for some reason had over 18g of storage. My phone only has 64g. 18 is a lot with the way my storage is right now) and I don't know what else to do. I deleted Genshin about maybe a week before it was officially a year since I started playing. I love the game, but I can't play it on anything else, and I don't want to have my storage suffer because of it. Please tell me, why does this game have to take up so much space?",4
I love this game but I wish there were just random things in the game. I think both of the twin should have super strength like throw a fricking planet in to the sun type strength because they clearly appear to be some type of god and I think that with that strength you should be able to pick up buildings in Mondstat with ease and carts. I also think that hovering or flying should be a thing (with only the twin characters) because just having wings as a glider with them is useless (in my opinion) flying should be activated like when you glide you just double tap the jump button any time and the characters will begin hovering and you take off to start flying.,5
"I just downloaded the game, super excited to play it but there seems to be something wrong happening. When I first tried playing the game I could barely even get past the introduction video about the twins because it was super laggy and would only freeze on one frame while the audio would be on and off distorted. When I did get in the game it ran mostly pretty smooth but the thing is I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the ground and even then I had to walk for the ground around me to load. The sky and water and pretty much anything but the ground was just just pitch black. I thought it was just because my phone couldn‚Äôt take it so i deleted the app and then redownloaded it but still had the same problem. Also came here to see if people had the same problem recently and it seems that they do. I look forward to when this will be fixed and I can play this great looking game.",1
"I Absolutely love this game. I am personally a big SAO fan and even though this is far from SAO just the ability to play a anime MMORPG on my phone is amazing and I absolutely love it. And one thing I love about this game is it doesn‚Äôt feel like a mobile game, it feels very detailed and well put together, like something you would buy on console. My only issue with this game is that I love this game but it‚Äôs not available on Xbox, if it was I would definitely buy it in Xbox no matter the price. I‚Äôm really impressed with this game and I really hope they make more MMORPG Games. One thing I think would be really cool is if they did a MMORPG game but based off of SAO. Cause Ik there‚Äôs already one out there but it‚Äôs really badly put together.",5
"This game features gameplay that you'd see on a $60 Console/PC game, but it's a free-to-play mobile game. The combat system is very smooth, intuitive, and just feels really good to play. On top of that, the game has beautiful, stylistic graphics and effects, as well as beautifully animated cutscenes. 

If you are the story type, you will find satisfaction in the depth of the story this game features- but you will find that you can also go off explore the large, open world to your heart's content, your curiosity constantly rewarded with hidden chests and challenges that make the detour worthwhile. 

This game has a little bit for everyone, and I think once you pick it up, you'll have trouble putting it down.",5
"Addictive, fun, massive map, amazing combat system, decent story, and amazing characters. The only thing from this game you could ask for is consistant content to binge. You can only play it roughly 30 minutes per day before you don‚Äôt get any more rewards. It is a lot like destiny in that aspect which is nice for some players who are more casual who don‚Äôt want to feel like they are missing out like they would in other games like WoW. 
I have been playing for around a year and a half and I have loved every second (aside from losing 50/50 of course) 

I would recommend to anyone looking for a casual single player game.",5
"I really love this game, it‚Äôs so pretty, and the story is interesting and the gameplay is amazing!!!! I have nothing bad to say about it!  What I wanted to suggest was a trading option with friends‚Ä¶ like a trading hub! With not only items, but CHARACTERS! My sister plays the game and she always gets the characters I want, and I get the characters she wants, haha! I think it would be really cool if you could trade, but maybe at a certain level. Not super high though please- maybe like‚Ä¶ level 30 in adventure rank since you have to be at 16 to join others worlds. I think it would be great! Again, I really really love this game! It‚Äôs one of my favorites.",5
"I love this game so much! The graphics are beyond beautiful and the voices are soothing. I love the character designs and the fact that you can climb and swim. You can‚Äôt freely move in a lot of games, but in this game you can do so much! The only thing is I wish for more customization, but I do realize it‚Äôs a bit hard to do and animate and all that. Other than that it‚Äôs very immersive and I love the battling! There‚Äôs no ‚Äútimer‚Äù like other games have. I was very skeptical at first, but now it‚Äôs one of my favorite games. I thought I had to know anime stuff I play (kinda silly, yeah I know) but you don‚Äôt. (I‚Äôm not big into anime). Just beautiful. It deserves all 5 stars!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since 1.5, and it was really fun to play, but after Sumeru‚Äôs release, all I‚Äôve got to say is I‚Äôm utterly disappointed. The new cast of characters is almost all whitewashed. Sumeru is supposed to be a region based on Middle Eastern cultures and countries, which has a very big population of tan people, so would it really be that hard to make some more playable characters more tan? Yun Jin is a perfect example of how Hoyoverse was able to represent Chinese culture appropriately in the game, so is it really that much more of a hassle to represent other cultures other than their own? They‚Äôve claimed to have done their research on the region and the Sumerian landscape and environment is amazing, but the characters are terribly executed. Would it be a problem if the workers needed to put a little more thought into their designs? Something has to change if I‚Äôm going to continue playing this game.",1
"Game was very good when first starting, but as you get to higher levels the game just gets boring, the company releases filler events that aren‚Äôt always the best they seem half finished, they could be better but they don‚Äôt put in time and enough effort. Certain items in domains/dungeons (for other games) take forever to obtain. It‚Äôs slowly becoming a pay to win and I regret spending my money on this game. The gacha aspect for characters is amazing but when trying to get items to level those characters it just isn‚Äôt fair. Certain characters you can get at lower levels you cannot use them until later stages of the game since their items aren‚Äôt in certain parts of the map.",4
Such a fun game! I was looking for a game like this around the beginning of this year and I couldn‚Äôt find one until I saw a add for Genshin Impact. So glad I got it. I joined this year and I am absolutely hooked! I have been playing for hours almost every day! I have no complaints what so ever. It has helped me so much with my boredom and much more. Such great graphics and character designs. The worlds are beautiful too. There is a big map and a bunch of things you can collect. I‚Äôve recommended this game to so many of my friends and most of them have it now! Thank you so much for this beautiful game. I absolutely love Genshin Impact. Keep doing what you are doing!,5
"I absolutely love how this game is but sometimes glitches will catch me off guard and have me so confused, sometimes whenever you open a chest or get a reward in general for something the reward doesn‚Äôt show up like it‚Äôs supposed too but luckily you just close and open the game and the rewards will be there. Timmy‚Äôs pigeons also disappeared sometimes, npcs will run into walls, cutscenes will sometimes be glitches, etc. I also don‚Äôt like how sometimes puzzles are so vague with clues it takes hours to complete until you search up a video and see that it could have been solved in 4 minutes, despite this, overall i think this game is rlly fun and i recommend it.",4
"Hoyoverse due to the lack of proper representation in the game you will get a one star until change happens. You try to do the bare minimum and get around with it but that just won‚Äôt work. Saying your using real cultures and countries as an inspiration for the game is very stretched. Specifically Sumeru, this placed is based off of Arabic and other cultures in that region the stereotypes and lack of color in characters show that you really don‚Äôt care. If you truly want to have a successful game and a continuing one I suggest u own up to your mistakes and make changes to the 3.0 characters skin color. I really enjoy this game but the way you try to use countries and their cultures but then not showing proper representation is sad and pathetic and it needs to stop. HOPEFULLY YOU-ACTUALLY LISTEN AND CARE FOR YOUR FANBASE AND THE FUTURE OF GENSHIN. Until then one star review and will always be Free to Play. I pray you make changes and realize your mistakes.",1
"Ive been playing genshin for a while (you can depend on this) so i love the details its beautiful you can explore wherever you want co-op and lots more so the one problem is the wishing, basically its really hard to get primos once you reach to Adventure rank 50-60 cause if u have done all the quest and all you will get less primos and that means less characters.                Also  the system for the gacha is really unfair cause its hard to get lots of wishes for a character. And i know hoyoverse is getting money from it (good for them) but for the f2p‚Äôs its really hard and it takes forever to get a single wish. We need to pay or spend Months to get 1 five star character.",4
"I love this game, I‚Äôve been playing since March of 2021. This game has so many good perks and are starting make events for newer players, which is really thoughtful. The reason I didn‚Äôt put a 5 is because when you need something for a quest and have to fight bosses or buy it from a store in a city, like Monstadt for example, the store you use with anemo tokens should be be restocked every week in my opinion, same with the Liyue one. I also think people should be able to drop things for other players, for example, say you have 5 polearm billets and your friend needs one to craft a weapon, you could just drop one for them to take. That‚Äôs the main thing I want to see, otherwise an amazing and addictive game! ‚ú®",4
"im just gonna say now, this game takes up to like 12 gb of storage at the full game but its worth it. some parts of the game are more difficult than others but thats what makes it fun. you have to change up your strategy, maybe your party. this game has a gorgeous open world that you can explore, puzzles you have to solve to get rewards and so much more. genshin is a bit complicated but imo thats what makes it fun, its a lot to learn but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier to remember and follow the pattern.

if you‚Äôre going to download this app, just be wary parts of it are complicated and it will drain your battery if youre on mobile (like i am). the controls are something you would have to kind of get used to but once you understand them it becomes natural to you. starting out, get any chests you can and pick up everything in sight, it will all have a use eventually. even if you dont think it will, believe me, it will.

i think that‚Äôs pretty much it for what i have to say about this game.",5
"This is definitely one of my favorite games. For new players, get through the tutorial and soon enough you‚Äôll be obsessed. The gacha system and dynamic characters help with that too. My only worry is how much storage the game takes up. I‚Äôm not sure how they‚Äôre going to be able to keep making these huge updates with new areas in Teyvat without losing mobile players due to storage. Hopefully they can at least add the game to switch and Xbox to give more platform options. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a great game and I definitely recommend it. The gameplay is similar to Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild if you played in teams instead of just Link.",5
"I overall love this game, but in the end, I ended up needing to delete. Now I do lots of animating of sorts, and even that takes up a lot of storage. I needed to delete lots of my projects to download this game because it just took up a huge amount of storage. And because of this, I needed to delete because I couldn‚Äôt expand my storage amount. Now obviously there‚Äôs no changing this, but I just want to let everyone know that this game is a huge amount of storage space. even though this is the case, this game is absolutely amazing. It‚Äôs so relaxing (at some points) and the graphics are outstanding. Even if the storage is huge, I still totally recommend this game because it was one of my favorites.",4
This game such an important part in my life now honestly I feel like when I say that it sounds stupid but. I‚Äôve grown so emotionally attached to this game and it‚Äôs helped me out of my darkest times and every single day I look forward to getting online and being able to play. This game is so much fun with all the characters you can get and especially with all the Inazuma‚Äòs new quest that take forever to do you can never really get bored in my opinion.  Sadly I lost my first account but I made a second account and I‚Äôm slowly building my way back up to A.R 38. I love this game so much and I‚Äôm never gonna stop playing no matter how many new games come out:),5
"Genshin Impact is a beautiful game with unique characters, a wonderful open world map, and interesting story line. (No I am not a bot) I give this game 5 stars for those reasons and I love playing the game. However, while I am pretty apathetic towards the anniversary rewards (I have never really been one to hype myself up too much), I can understand the backlash from the community. I think MiHoyo could do more in terms of listening to their community and I hope they will make these improvements in the future. However I think it goes to say hate the creator, not the game. The game truly lives up to most of its hype and I am looking forward to continuing my adventure in the future.",5
"I was introduced to the game a while ago. I‚Äôve been playing non-stop ever since. I have become attached to the game. It is a HUGE comfort game for me with all the amazing characters with endless lore. It‚Äôs always fun watching and reading theories. The quests are so in depth and so fun. It‚Äôs actually a challenge and I adore that. But, the game can‚Äôt be physically speed-ran. You need to put in time and effort, so if you have time in your hands, Genshin Impact is a great recommendation. The action and cutscenes are beautiful. The animation is even better, trust me on that. The characters themselves are so in detail and so beautiful, you might even get attached! Try it out if you have time! Stay safe and have fun :) <3",5
"Id say this game has brought me out of my boredom especially during the summer or when i have nothing else to play though, i gave it a 4 start rating instead of five because i feel like there isnt much more enjoyable content once you start getting later into the game. The events every month and new story quests are interesting but after a while it can get a bit boring if your not a person who likes to play games for the lore. [UPDATE]The game also lacks a lot and I mean ALOT of POC representation for a game that‚Äôs supposed to have lands based off other cultures there are only about 2 ‚Äòdarker skinned‚Äô playable characters in the game but overall I still love playing it from time to time",4
Not gonna lie to y‚Äôall the gatcha element is real in this one. However all the content can be completed with the 4 characters you start with. That being said you will get other characters with the gatcha system no matter what I have got lucky and got both event banner characters so far and one other 5 star with just the primo gems you get doing the story and opening chests. I recommend single pulls since you get more for your gems doing that. There isn‚Äôt much content yet you‚Äôll fly through this game they are adding new content though so I‚Äôm sure in the future that will be a non issue. This is the best mobile game I‚Äôve played and am impressed with how well it runs and how fun it is.,5
"As a PC/Console game on mobile it's pretty good. Great visuals, music despite its lack of originality. Gameplay loop at its core is fun. However the extremely predatory monetization is just awful. Terrible rates and stamina system. It's like they don't want hardcore people to play yet try and force them to stay. Disappointing considering all the feedback they received during closed beta and the more fair & sustainable system in their previous game Honkai Impact 3rd. Baffling considering they reduced the amount of currency you can earn in Abyss from the beta considering the atrocious rates. Well below industry standards. Sad to see that they pushed monetization to the limit for launch, damaging dedicated long term investment in the process. Story is also unimportant with unskippable cutscenes. Let the players decide if they want to pay attention to that annoying cringe. Please do better.",1
"I was excited for this game since i was playing Honkai impact and i knew they would nail the open world type of game. Although i knew it would be good, it‚Äôs more beautiful and fun than i expected. whenever i‚Äôm playing i‚Äôm always relaxed and the dialogue and voice acting lands it‚Äôs jokes. The cutscenes are gorgeous and i love the character choice at the beginning. i always smile when the characters are interacting, and the voice acting exceeds my expectations. i‚Äôm super excited to see what‚Äôs new things they‚Äôll add in the game. Some kind of home or housing system would be super cool! I do really hope they add it to xbox, it‚Äôs so sad that everywhere else gets it except the console i play :( i‚Äôll have to be grateful for mobile for now",5
"Game was a lot of fun but the direction of their design is poor now. They will create a problem and then ‚Äúsell‚Äù you the solution. 

A lot of their new characters are designed around potentially being viable in the future (cyno and dehya) instead of with current content. Using in game currency or real money hoping something might be usable in the future is bad and developers shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for such poor design.

Likewise, a great number of character base kits are balanced around the user having multiple copies (constellations) to boost their base kit. This makes having the base kit clunky and not user friendly. This was not really seen in the older units and is a newer trend to encourage people to spend real money.

Overall, the game was fun when the company could take user feedback and admit they messed up (like with Zhongli) but with new characters such as Faruzan and Dehya they have ignored the community and have deliberately given these characters (products) clunky and poorly designed kits that require months of in game saving or hundreds of dollars to ‚Äúfix.‚Äù

TLDR: company was good at launch but has been shifting to focusing on creating problems and selling their users the ‚Äúfix.‚Äù 

As always, this is my opinion based on my experience with the game and your mileage might vary.",1
"This is an amazing game with amazing characters. There is a balance of both lore and gameplay. I do have a few problems though, the game has a lot of lore, from story quests, world quests etc. i just wish there was a way to make dialogue go faster and so that we didn't have to wait for a character to finish all they way, some players might not find this bad but i do, especially when im trying to finish quests quickly. Another problem is a bug i have with the loading screen, sometimes the loading stops halfway through the geo symbol. Ive tried reinstalling the app and it only worked once so. But still I love all the characters, designs are good etc.",4
"First of all, I think it‚Äôs a beautiful game! Second, I love how you could do quests, and have fun at the same time. Third, I do have some things that could be better. 1. Maybe when you‚Äôre trying to walk around, it doesn‚Äôt send you into a run? 2. It could be cool if you were able to go over to some birds, and grab one or two of them. 3. Maybe add some minor details, for example. Adding squirrels, stray animals, and just natural animal habitats! Then you could be able to get an animal best friend! These are just some suggestions, but overall, the game is a blast to play! Thank you for reading this review, and hopefully considering the thoughts!",5
(Warning this includes personal thoughts) I really wish that we can get 1600 primogems every new year this will help people save up for their New Years resolutions in Genshin I think they would love Genshin if they do this! ü§ëü§ëü§ë There is a bug in the game where it kicks me out a lot!üëæ‚õîÔ∏è! Also there should be a new character named Mochi and she would be a coffee maker it would be so cute!!!! It also needs an easier acension because it makes me want to ignore them‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs just me being lazy! I‚Äôm a huge fan of this game and to invest in it some how would be wonderful!‚úåüèæWell thanks for reading this! And remember ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get a frostbite ‚Äú Quoted by Keaya‚Ä¶,5
"So my friend first told me about Genshin Impact, and i started playing and OMG THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME!! The storyline about siblings trying to get reunited with each other and the adventure along the way is just so addicting and fun. And i LOVE all the new characters and archon quests and parts of the map like SUMERU ITS SO PRETTY XD. And the fact that you can play with your friends is so exciting and fun especially when you‚Äôre far away from them. And i love the battle music in sumeru and mondstadt its just so adventurous and exciting. This game is literally perfect and i would be 100% ok if Mihoyo didn't update GI anymore. But in conclusion, this game is the best stress relief and addicting, time consuming, creative game i have ever played.",5
"I love Genshin Impact. An incredible time killer, and not just a mindless one. I could easily spend hours just playing this game. I love the open world concept, and the anime-style of the game is gorgeous. There‚Äôs just one thing. I‚Äôm a mobile player, so I legit had to shut down my iPad and completely restart it to clear up enough storage. And yet the graphics are still blurry. I‚Äôve seen videos of gameplay, and they all are sharp and clear. I get that a mobile device isn‚Äôt the best device to play a game like this, but it‚Äôs still kind of annoying. I just really wish I could be able to experience this game in full",5
"Hey hey it‚Äôs me KILLERBLADE, ya Hoyo I will say u got a good little idea going on here but what got me is your growth rate it‚Äôs not at a controlled pace is what I‚Äôm assuming but I would like to help you and give suggestions on what to do next to help with your games growth because as I can see your not on the right track if ‚Äúyou know what I mean‚Äù so I‚Äôll be waiting to help you we can discuss more in genshin just find me as KILLERBLADE and friend me then we can get down to some real business. As for my rating of this game I really love how the mechanics are so smooth and the graphic quality being so good as well the only few things that got are the weapons and certain creatures like ‚ÄúStorm terror‚Äù.

Weapons: why or how do you not gov the weapons their own second ability that is like a special move in the game and I‚Äôm not talking about the first one you see in bio.

Creatures: don‚Äôt you think it would be just outstanding if there were certain multitudes of dragons and I don‚Äôt mean as in ‚ÄúDragon spine‚Äù or ‚ÄúStorm terror‚Äù 

If you need to know what I mean then friend me and we can talk more maybe I can give you my discord. Well that‚Äôs all from me KILLER out.",4
"it's well known that hoyoverse doesn't answer reviews as far as i'm aware but here are some improvements that need to be made:

1) darker skinned characters other than sumeru npcs, xinyan, and kaeya. yes i looked at sumeru leaks and honestly they are gonna happen but darker skinned characters need to be made (more than just in sumeru) i'm really hoping the following nations have more darker skinned characters.

2) more traveler lore. the only reason why i'm continuing playing this game is because of the lore and we NEED more traveler backstory other than ""oh yeah they are rocks and have a blanket and stuff"" i understand the other characters are important but come on, the traveler needs better lore

3) lgbt representation. it won't hurt you and idc about laws you did it in honkai do it in genshin 

4) standard banner fixes. the standard banner needs more 5* characters and the same fix that you did with the weapon banner. 

5) More albedo appearances. i just wanna see him in more nations along with klee üòì

6) the sixth thing is just LISTEN TO THE FANBASE when we say we want more rep or rewards listen to us.

7) better rewards for upcoming anniversary. i'm not expecting much but i hope you all at the hq or whatever learned from last year's anniversary.

copy and paste to another review so this spreads.",1
"for starters, genshin isn‚Äôt the worst game ever. it can be fun when you make it fun but that isn‚Äôt what i‚Äôm talking about today. my problem with genshin is the skin tone issue there is for sumeru. sumeru is based off regions irl where the common skin gone you would see is brown, i‚Äôm not from that area so i might be wrong i‚Äôm just going off of videos/info that was told to me. for it to be based off that region and having the playable characters being pale is really saddening imo. the fact that the player base was excited over npcs being slightly darker than most says a lot. not to mention the leaked enemies, who are also brown. i‚Äôm not sure but if hoyoverse can make npcs and enemies brown they can make playable characters brown. dehya, who is leaked to be lighter than xinyan is a problem. i do wanna say again that i am not from the regions that sumeru is based off, but if this is the ‚Äúrep‚Äù that they‚Äôre getting then it gives me an insight on how natlan will be, which is leaked to be based off latin america i think. i really do hope hoyoverse will listen to us when we complain about their skin tone issue, but until money is thrown into the table it‚Äôs highly unlikely.",3
"although genshin impact is a very fun and enjoyable game, with many interesting features and quests, along with a well thought out plot, hoyoverse needs to STEP UP there game. literally. we see 0 representation in the game. sumeru is the newest region as of now, and is based off south asia, but we see no proper representation of their culture and people. so far, out of the 45+ characters, we have ONE character with dark skin. but thats not the only issue. we can see that hoyoverse is getting lazy and greedy. the gaming experience has downgraded and their thirst for money has multiplied as the game has progressed. there is also no content for endgame players, and a lot of new players really struggle with the game. there‚Äôs a lack of entertainment and overwhelming demand for money, skill, time, and attention. 

overall, hoyoverse needs to improve their work, or the game is going to fail. we need change.",1
"Probably one of the better-looking games you can get for a mobile device. Some players have had issues with crashing, however. There have also been many complaints about the difficulty of drawing a 5* character, it SHOULD be difficult, there‚Äôs a reason they call it a ‚Äú5* character.‚Äù The game plays pretty well, although I think it could be improved if the developers made progression slightly easier and maybe they could also reduce the amount of money that you need to use to get the best characters/items. I wish the story was updated more frequently as well, but overall GREAT game, I would totally recommend this to anyone who is reading this review.",4
"Gonna make it quick. Progression is terrible. Combat is mediocre. Open world is great‚Ä¶ until you get to Inazuma (will elaborate further below). Music is fantastic. Quests range from good to wooden. And Characters are (see previous). Teapot was the only thing keeping me from leaving. Tldr; this game is overhyped/very well marketed and the only reason you play it is because the characters are SUUUPER pretty.
 
Okay I wanted to make an extended portion below but there‚Äôs honestly way too much wrong with this game for me to write it all out here. Just know that I WANTED to like this game. This review comes not from a place of hatred, but of disappointment. Look, just go BUY a game. Chances are, it‚Äôll be better than this one. Maybe you‚Äôll learn to appreciate the medium more and not just consume whatever shiny new thing comes out. At least, I would hope so.",2
"Wow, to think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs already been a full year since the game has fully released(or maybe longer I dunno it‚Äôs been awhile) the combat is fun and fluid. The world is beautiful, and the character design is colorful and fun. Grinding for artifacts and the gacha rates are always going to be a problem, but when you actually achieve the perfect artifact, or finally getting that 5 star you‚Äôve been wanting feels so good and so rewarding when it puts in work in the game. It‚Äôs generally pretty balanced, download this game if you want to play for something. There is almost infinite things to do in tyvat. Also plz add more hydro characters. We don‚Äôt need anymore Pyro DPS‚Äô :)",5
"I didn‚Äôt know what I was getting into when I downloaded the game, but I am glad I did. The game is very thorough and it plays like any other big platform action-RPGs out there. The character design is beautiful, the battle mechanics are easy to understand and the game plays beautifully as well being exciting every time you play. I have been playing for over a year now and I enter every day to complete challenges and quests Because of how fun and fresh it is. My only issue thus far has been the lack of controller support on the latest update (2.2) and the regular game crashes on previous devices. I think the co-op experience is a bit clunky but there is definitely room to grow in that sense.",4
"Genshin is a beautiful game. From world design to character details they do a brilliant job of making the world feel alive and fun to wander. The story is a bit slow in the beginning but as you go on the story fully invests you to the point you can‚Äôt put it down.

Huge problem though, if you‚Äôre f2p it‚Äôs pretty rough, especially later game. The game is based off a gacha system which means you only have a slim chance at getting the characters or weapons you want. Those chances don‚Äôt come very often if you‚Äôre f2p. It can take a f2p user a month to get you a 10 pull which will get you something decent, not great. 

As a result it‚Äôs better to avoid thinking of it as a f2p game. The best price in the game is for a monthly pass called Welkin. You spend  5$ USD and gets you a solid sum of gems per day, cutting down the amount of time for a 10 pull to about 10 days. 

Still, if you want to get the characters you want, even with Welkin, it‚Äôs either an investment of time and patience or your wallet. Mihoyo knows what they‚Äôve developed is addictive and fun to play and they make sure to drain their users for it.",4
"Quit complaining about the anniversary rewards. Mihoyo is a company that‚Äôs focused on profits and you‚Äôre not entitled to rewards because you decided to spend most of your time on their video game. Even if you spent money, you already received what they owed you. This community is so childish, especially those writing negative reviews on other games created by Mihoyo. My sympathy goes to the honkai players, they don‚Äôt deserve their game getting slandered because entitled genshin players want to throw a tantrum over rewards. Seriously you guys are playing for rewards over the actual game at this point.",5
"I just started playing and this game is amazing! I love the story and the character design, the graphics, and the objective! It‚Äôs very interesting and there‚Äôs LOTS to do. 
It is laggy for me though,  but that is probably my device(ipad). I have to exit the game a lot because it freezes. And a forewarning: the full game(upon uploading app, you can upload full game, it‚Äôs free) takes up 9GB PF STORAGE. It‚Äôs worth it in my opinion though. That‚Äôs why I recommend getting it on a larger device. My sibling plays on an iPad as well, and she has no lagging problems. 
I still persist, despite the lagging But for people looking for a full, action packed, interactive adventure game, I highly reccomend a Genshin Impact! Tevyat is beautiful!",4
"mihoyo has released a series of underwhelming characters lately and it‚Äôs time they step up their game. you can‚Äôt release a game that has done this well and then just throw your players under the bus and expect them to pick up scraps. the anniversary rewards look like absolute trash and kokomi is performing terribly. as someone who LOVES kokomi and rolled for her, she needs a buff and needs the -100% crit removed. yoimiya needs buffed as well, and raiden‚Äôs burst needs to work with beidou‚Äôs ult. i‚Äôve seen so many players and streamers burnt out with the game lately because of the lack of satisfying content and the new content is underwhelming. the 2.1 story quest was rushed and kokomi and gorou‚Äôs characters were completely shafted. it‚Äôs a shame to write this because the art, design, landscapes, and music are top tier. unfortunately most people will judge the game by story and gameplay which are just going downhill lately.",1
"I love this game so much. It had such an addicting storyline! I love the style of the game design. The graphics, animation, and full-out design of this game is amazing! I really recommend playing this game. This game is amazing even if you disagree with me you should try it! It allows you to put your creative, imaginative mind to this game. Who knows do a really weird role play with Zhongli and Childe. Anywho I don‚Äôt want to just rate this and provide no feedback whatsoever so here is the feedback I would like to give.

1. (JUST FOR PLAYERS)
Hello. I don‚Äôt use hacks honestly, but I would recommend you to use them rarely to none. You should support the developer for this awesome game there giving and allowing cheats just so you cna get some of your favorite characters. 

2. (FOR MIHOYO)
Hello. Recently I completed a Misty Dungeons Rune thing, but I didn‚Äôt get my primogems. I got nothing my primogems remained to
the number I had before. Please let me know why this happend. 

Thank you for reading this review. Also, if your downloading this game then GO THE GAME IS DOWNLOADED! 

Start your journey! Bai! :D",5
I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since it came out on mobile. And I can say omg wow is this one of the best games I‚Äôve played in a long time. (Oh and incase you don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs free.) The story is so addictive and even when you can‚Äôt do those quests there is so much to do. Not only is the story so wonderful but the graphics and animation are beyond anything I could ever hope for. This game has so much going for it and it also has beautiful gorgeous characters. The gacha part of this game is so freaking addicting and keeps the player wanting more. (And dang do I want those 5 stars.) anyway THANK YOU MIHOYO FOR THIA GAME BECAUSE YOU CREATED SOMETHING SO WONDERFUL AND AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL AND CAPTIVATING FOR US We love you. - Reagan and the discord gang. ‚ù§Ô∏è,5
"When I first started to play it was a really fun experience, they gave me enough whatever it‚Äôs called to buy wishes also the fighting part is the best part, it‚Äôs so well made. But then I started to get into the big levels which I knew would not give me as much things as when I stated out but I didn‚Äôt expect it to be the little. It would only give you one wish each day which might seem to be a lot but how likely you get anything over a blue isn‚Äôt very much, which was. Very disappointing and then I saw that other people where having the same problem, which led me to right this review, p.s. sorry for my bad grammar.",5
"Honestly, this game is very impressive especially with the story mode. It‚Äôs so good that it might be the best story/adventure game I‚Äôve ever played! But, there is one thing that has been bothering me since I‚Äôve started. The missions when you get later on to the game are SO hard! I am adventure rank 22 and the side quests are so difficult. I get so frustrated with it. I feel like the mages shields are to powerful especially when people don‚Äôt have enough mora, or enough xp books to fight hard enemies. So, maybe nerf the difficulty? Especially for the low level players. Idk, this is just a suggestion, but overall I recommend this game because to me, it is probably one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. Thanks MiHoyo!",5
"Staying on trend in 2020, this is a wonderful game in the PC that is beyond generous to free to play players, but here on the phone, it is very prone to crashing. Every time I warp back to Monstadt, crash. Albedo‚Äôs big attack, crash. If they could get the crashes under control, this would be a five star title without question. They just released a new version and I‚Äôm sad to see that the stability issues have not been addressed and may have even become worse. This becomes a huge problem with the introduction of the freezing mechanic. It can crash in the middle of combat out in the cold, and when I log back in, my characters may have been killed or frozen to death because the game doesn‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôm not still in the game when it crashes. Could really use a few stability improvements.",3
"it‚Äôs very fun and enjoyable and i like the variety of things i can do in the game when you‚Äôre not focusing on a quest. the graphics are beautiful and the story is really good so far. i am IN LOVE with the characters, not only are they pretty but they also have depth! the only thing i don‚Äôt really like is the resin system; as someone who is on AR38 it‚Äôs really difficult to move on to next adventure ranks without resin, but it runs out way too quickly and reloads way too slow :( i think it‚Äôd be better if resin took less time to reload or if the rewards that require resin would have a lower resin requirement. aside from that, i love this game and always recommend it to people when the topic of gaming comes up!",5
"This is going to be a short review. So it takes up SO much of my iPad storage I have deleted and offloaded over 20 different games. This is very frustrating cause I actually kinda liked those games and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna like it or not. I‚Äôm trying to download it because everyone says its like the best game ever. Even my favorite youtuber plays it. It also keeps on saying that I have insufficient storage space, but every time I check my storage, it says it can hold 3 more GB. I don‚Äôt think this makes sense. I also am on 85% finished so 3 GB is enough space to get it finished, right? That‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm confused about.",5
"This game can be summed up to one word, amazing. For a while I‚Äôve been looking for a open-world game that allows you to have fun, I found it. Your not tied to the story but lured in, exploring the world is a blast because within 300 feet there‚Äôs a little side-quest type thing you can do. Collecting characters is pretty good, its a little hard to collect Primogems, I‚Äôd recommend adding in more side quests. Puzzles are unique, GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING, the co-op is really fun with friends. I do wish there was more you can do like a world boss that‚Äôll spawn in the map you can take down, rather than the bosses you can fight solo. Other than that its a wonderful game, I can‚Äôt wait to see whats next!",5
"The community is split. One side being the happy, kind, warm side and the other being full of weirdos who are overly simps and don't touch grass and are istg chronically online. It's annoying the hate this game gets because it's actually fun aside from the fandom. Yes it gets boring sometimes but don't most games after a while ? 

My only issue is the fact that for logging out on a PS4 or PS5, you have to log out of your ps4 account ENTIRELY then log back in just to log out of genshin. What if I'm sharing the PS4 and the other person has their own account?? I don't want to continually log out of my PS4 just to switch accounts. You made it complicated for nothing. The games fun but y'all make stuff overly complicated.",4
"i love genshin! it's a great game. but i think we need our original resin higher, because there are so many bosses that we can't get too without using our primogems to get resin, or using fragile resin. and there are ways to use resin that seem unconventional. like the enchantment material. aside from that; i played the newest archon quest before it was debugged so the issue might have been fixed, but during our sibling's memories there were NPC's i saw while going to the domain. i talked to them and couldn't tell if they were from earlier and meant to be there or not. thank you, hoyoverse, for a great game! (but more inclusive characters would be really nice :)) )",5
"Make Dehya better! As a five star character, she deserves to feel like and do the damage of a five star character. For any new genshin users, be mindful that the devs for Genshin are very greedy and five star characters DO NOT get equal treatment. 
They recently released a new five star(max rarity) character that‚Äôs worse than a four star character, when five stars are emphasized in game to be so much better than four stars. This is Dehya. Dehya is a waste of in game currency AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ROLL FOR HER. You will have trouble clearing anything with her, more than mostly anyone else in the game that is a DPS. Your free currency is limited and to guarantee a five star character is very expensive. 

Dehya is a very pretty character and has been hyped up lore wise and by the EN playerbase for some time now. We will not tolerate this kind of treatment, and we ask that you no longer attempt to silence this part of the playerbase. :)",1
"i love genshin impact, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äôs very hard to get new characters. let‚Äôs be honest, all of us love to wish for new characters. but it‚Äôs just quite hard !! 
I personally think it should be easier to get primogems. from the daily quests, we only get 10. and there are some quests that give you 60~100 primogems, but those are very hard !! especially the adventure rank ascension quests. genshin would be the best game ever if they just made the quests easier honestly. just the ascension quests at least. i‚Äôve been playing for 8 months now, and i‚Äôm still stuck at AR 24. i‚Äôd also like to be rewarded more primogems when doing quests! thank you for reading !! ( ^œâ^ )",4
"Genshin is a great game not gonna lie! But whenever I update it, it says that I have too much storage so I delete apps and photos. It lets me update it but when I load into the game it says I have no storage AGAIN. So I deleted HALF of my phone and PHOTOS. But still says I have too much storage. This is why I kinda hate the new events and all that stuff. So please Fix this :C im getting SOOOOOO annoyed with this because my friend wanted to play with me on genshin so she tried downloading it and it said too much storage for her as well. She was sooooo sad when she saw that. And she also almost deleted the whole phone Bit Made a Choice to just delete Genshin and she never came back to it ever since. So please Fix this and thank you <3",4
"I truly love playing this game. The graphics are beautiful. I love the storyline and characters and even npcs back stories. 
It‚Äôs witty and sweet, but also challenging and mysterious. The lore you uncover along the way will leave you touched and fascinated. It‚Äôs much more cerebral than you would initially believe‚Ä¶

The mini games/events are cute and fun too. mihoyo knows how to keep players engaged with the content and lore you can discover in tandem with these events. I look forward to each new adventure. ^^

I‚Äôve never had issues with gameplay and the developers are on top of issues quickly. There are so many play styles available that keep it interesting.

Even for f2p this game has plenty of opportunities to earn characters and weapons and special items both in game and through the HoYoLAB app (which is super interactive and useful now!). Some f2p characters are excellent and widely used by all players. Imo it‚Äôs more than worth it to play even if you only have a f2p option.

I just love this game, it truly brightens my day ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®",5
"I deal with some stuff not gonna get into that, but this game helps me escape reality for awhile which is pleasant, it‚Äôs a well written story, the game graphics are beautiful, most of the events are lovely, and it is very enjoyable! I made many friends on the game, who have the same Interest as me and they‚Äôre good teammates! It‚Äôs a comfort game of mine, clearlyüòÖüëç. The only thing I have to complain about is the wish system, compared to most wish systems this is the worse (my opinion). You usually gotta have at least a 70% pity or higher to get a five star, which for f2p is difficult! (I‚Äôm not f2p anymore though, lol.) But I am glad this game is made, I can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next! R.I.P my device due to storage, haha.",4
"I had to post this review. I love adventure type games and a great story, this game brought both so well!!! I keep trying to level up just so I can read the next main story part. This is basically the ONLY GAME I WILL BE EVER PLAYING in my days I am resting. That is rare. I love the character designs, the voice acting, the AMAZING scenery, the side quests and main story. I can‚Äôt wait what next is in store so please keep me on my toes!!! Oh and please tell ALL THE ANIMATORS amazing work on the land. I wish I have the skill and I personally know the struggle. I am personally {failing} in modeling myself because time management is not my forte. So please tell them that and keep doing amazing work!!",5
"This game is amazing when I first download this game I was a bit lost but after playing for hours you got the hang of it overall, this game is beautiful. He has such good quality. The music is beautiful. The character designs are amazing All I have to say about this game is that it‚Äôs amazing. This is how I spend my free time playing this game. Only bad thing about it is that sometimes when I have no Internet, I can‚Äôt play it I wish you could play this game without Internet but overall, it‚Äôs an amazing game with amazing back stories and everything like that also does the only going to save me from boredom I really recommend this game for anyone.",5
genshin impact is so disappointing when looking at what hoyoverse is trying to represent for darker skin tones. 95% of their characters are literally the COLOR white like not the color of a white person they are genuinely the color of paper. üòê and the few ‚Äúdark‚Äù characters that they do have when compared with real skin tones just looks like a white person got a tan. hoyoverse makes all of their characters extremely white and once seeing the leaked characters of sumeru (a region that is supposed to be based off of india) i quit the game because i was just so done with how they were representing real cultures. they made sumeru‚Äôs representing god WHITE. for sumeru to be based off of a country with majority dark skinned people how dare they make the representing character a white skinned person?? it‚Äôs so disrespectful. do not play this game it is a poor excuse for representation and is extremely unfriendly to f2p players.,1
"I know they are leaks and aren‚Äôt the final product but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt criticize them. People have been waiting for dark skin reputation(?) and all they have gotten is 2. Sumaro(?) is so post to be based off of places with dark skinned POC but the leaks are out and they are all white. Whiter then klee whiter then diluc whiter then diona and so on and so forth. The god is so pail you need sunglasses to look at her. This is just over all just disappointing. I will continue to play the game since I put so much worth and effort into it, heck I even go by albedo now bc of how much I relate to him. But no more money spent by me nothing not until you fix this. We. Want. Dark. Skinned. Character. People are tired of waiting for reputation and getting nothing. 
(Also sorry for any miss types of spelling errors)",2
"Genshin Impact is an amazing game with great graphics, storyline, characters, and plot but I have several complaints about Sumeru. Since this game is based on real places, the people represented in the place should also be similar, but it‚Äôs not. In Sumeru man of the character are pale, paler than Monstadt‚Äôs characters who are German. There is only one dark skinned character who, frankly, isn‚Äôt that dark. I love the characters designs for Sumeru but their pale skin irks me. I also feel like the Dendro archon is poorly designed and is also, very pale. There are several dark skinned women fan-art of what the Dendro could look like and I heavily prefer them. Another point I‚Äôd like to make is that one of the playable characters from the leaks (which are given by trustworthy creators) is incredibility stereotypical. She looks like a female version of Aladdin with Diona‚Äôs color palette. Her design is Islamphobic and problematic. Please change these things",1
"I download Genshin impact a week ago and loved it the gameplay was so superior to any other game I played before. the only downside of this game is that it takes up a ridiculously large amount of space and the only reason I was able to download it was because I have cloud plus so I have 2 TB of storage. because of its size, it takes about 10 minutes to download (on good wifi.) other than that the game is so good that it completely substitutes for the fact that it takes up so much storage. anybody reading this if you want the game you may need to delete a bunch of photos or apps to be able to download this.",5
"This is honestly a great game! When you become an endgame player you might get a bit bored, but with every update comes new events! You can always participate in events and there is a Gacha system. 

!IF YOU ARE A CHILD DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON GACHA IN THIS GAME!

It is not worth it because nothing is guaranteed. If you get to 90 pity you will be guaranteed a five star, but if you are wishing in the limited banner, you are not guaranteed the limited 5 star when you get to 90 pity. You can either get Qiqi, Mona, Keqing, Diluc, and Jean or a weapon. It is a 50/50 chance. But don‚Äôt worry, if you have enough primos you can get the limited 5 star guaranteed! The next five star you get will be the limited, so keep on grinding!

Some people are complaining about storage. I agree a bit but some people are like ‚ÄúfiX uR gAmE‚Äù and giving the game 1 star. At least play the game first!

Someone also said that they couldn‚Äôt get past level 25 which probably means adventure rank 25. You have to do the Ascension Quest first.

Overall this is an awesome game!

PS:

Please give me Venti Hoyoverse.",5
"I had been playing Genshin since November 2020. The art of the game is really beautiful, the music soundtrack is very fun to listen to on repeat, and the story-writing is very intriguing. There are some areas where the game could have been improved on like the resin system where 1 resin takes way longer than needed to be replenished. There are also some aspects of the game that were either lacking like in the 2.0 and 2.1 update with the main story or elements in the game that were problematic and have not been addressed as it should have been. I do look forward to the team addressing these issues and maybe improvements that would improve all the players‚Äô quality of life in Genshin Impact.",4
"Now, as you can tell, i gave this five stars. However there is a point i would like to make- I play on mobile, (an ipad to be specific) and this game took ALL my storage to get. I deleted all my apps, and ot worked. But the thing was, i could re download those apps. Confusing, i know. Now im here updating the thing and deleting the apps AGAIN. Its great, just make sure you have enough storage-or unwanted apps. Edit: A year later, downloading this on my stronger device, still, the storage problem is UNREAL. I have 2 apps currently, still not enough storage. Again, great app, amazing, i love it so much, but the amount of storage it takes is insane.",5
"It took this non-gamer a while to get past the beginning play and into the open world.  I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it!  It has appeal on a lot of different levels.  The art is gorgeous.  The storyline is intricate.  The character backstories are interesting and well thought out.  While my 16 yr old enjoys the puzzles and the story. She wants to know every detail about the characters.  I enjoy the battles a lot.  My favorite thing is the seelies and hunting.  But that‚Äôs just me.  You can even go fishing.  If it‚Äôs a crappy day outside, u can always have a full day on Genshin.  Btw my only issue is with some of the character voices. I play on silent and read everything.",5
"I‚Äôm only able to play on mobile so it‚Äôs hard to find any attention grabbing and entertaining games but genshin seriously takes the cake. I have an iphone 8+ and there‚Äôs rarely any lag unless I‚Äôm on the game for several hours. If you think there‚Äôs nothing more for you to do in the game, trust me.. there is. You are constantly busy with things such as BP, leveling up characters/yourself, farming domains for artifacts and talents, decorating your serenitea pot, leveling up your friendship level, crafting, fighting bosses, etc. I‚Äôve been playing since november and am ar55, the controls of the game are extremely simple too and the graphics are amazing!",5
"I know this is a very fun game because I always play it on my friends iPad. But when I finally got enough storage cleaned up (10gb) I downloaded it on my own iPad, nothing worked. The problem is that even though I had enough storage and everything, it said ‚Äúinsufficient storage space‚Äù. I gave up and tried to download it on my phone. No ‚Äúinsufficient storage space‚Äù error but right after I clicked on the gateway to play the actual game, it kicked me out. No error message or anything. Just after the ‚Äúheadphones improve game‚Äù message, the screen turns white and just simply kicks me out. I cleaned out more space than I needed, reloaded and re installed the app multiple times, as well as resetting both devices. I hope somebody can reach out to me as soon as possible because I am really hoping to get to enjoy this game.",1
"Genshin Impact had a strong start with how you had so much to do and explore but once you start reaching ar 50 or ar55 you just follow a loop of doing your commissions and condensing your resin and leave . It gets boring when there‚Äôs nothing exciting afterword as the Only thing you can do it Just get more mora, better artifacts and books . The events are fun but they haven‚Äôt added a new permanent feature. The grind for primos is rough as you can get like 60 gems daily for completing your dailies excluding other quest and main Story quest but with having one wish cost 160 primos , you have to grind for 3 days to get enough for one wish .It‚Äôs a good game with characters and the landscape being astronomical but it just doesn‚Äôt cut it to the gameplay aspect where it gets repetitive.",3
"This is for people wanting to download, and for Mihoyo to read: Amazing app. I understand that there‚Äôs some storage problems, I‚Äôd recommend you make bigger storage or delete few apps and photos you don‚Äôt need or use. As for the game itself, beautiful music, quality, and overall story! It is sometimes hard and challenging. That can be both frustrating and fun at times!! I rated this four star because no game is absolutely perfect. Sometimes yes, it can lag or do some weird thing. But don‚Äôt review based on just that: review your experience of the game itself as well. I absolutely love this game and I play it every day, if not every other for 2 hours!! Very addicting and perfectly perfect‚ò∫Ô∏è that‚Äôs all I have!!üëãüëã",4
"Hello!

As much as I love this game, the graphics, the lore, the character designs, and practically anything you could think of in this game, the entire hoyoverse company SERIOUSLY needs to not just represent the outfits in game. you did a fantastic job representing liyue but we need more colorzation for the entire land of teyvat, you need to represent the people AND their color. I get we're getting darker skinned people for sumeru's release but it would truly be a wonder if they wouldn't JUST be tan. We have been continuously asking for dark skin characters over and over and its seems like no one is listening. PLEASE just add a little melanin in even a few new characters in a few updates. 

                    Thank you. -Virgil",4
"This game is awesome, i love the character designs and the story plot. The animations are so smooth, and i love pulling for characters! There are so many things about this game, but i have something to say. I‚Äôm sorry if this review is short, but here you go.

	So after about 3-4 times of attempting to win the battle against childe, and i finally did it. But when the cutscene started, it all of a sudden started reconnecting and took me back to the golden house. I was so frustrated and now i have to restart the childe battle. Hu Tao, you can beat tartaglia!

	Other than that this is a great game, you should tottaly get it if you see this review. But you better be ready to grind primogems and adventure rank exp!",5
"This game is so amazing! Everything about it is so good and there is little to no glitches or mistakes. The storyline and quests in this game aren't even half if it, you can level up your characters, fight enemies, even glide around! This is an overall grate game and with such a positive fandom too! You can meet people and join other servers, there's even events from time to time! You can team up with up to four people to beat bosses with , run around with, and overall just have fun! If theres on thing you can't get rid if in this game is how much of a challenge it is, and that's the best part! So go get the game instead of still reading this!",5
"This game is awesome. Has some slight graphics requirements so u can‚Äôt run it on below average PCs on good setting, but even tho I play on the lowest possible, the graphics are still awesome. The story and lore and backstories and great, and the foreshadowing for the plot lines is great. The quests are fun and the combat is diverse.

Now for some of the issues. Once you get to late game, around AR 55+, there is a severe lack of content to the point where I myself only play for 20 minutes a day because the dailies are all there is to do. Mihoyo does a good job of pumping out fun events so that is mitigated sometimes. 

Overall, I recommend this game highly. Be careful with ur money tho.",5
"I have been dealing with this issue for several months. Someone hacked my account and made purchases on my account. It cost my mother around $1000 and her credit card is still in the process of being replaced. I made a refund request but they called it refund abuse because it was successfully charged to my account, but it wasn‚Äôt me. The bank refunded it so it wasn‚Äôt really an issue anymore until they deducted over 4,000 primogens. My balance was in the NEGATIVE four thousands. I‚Äôm still dealing with it but managed to earn all them back. Then a few days ago they did it AGAIN. Now it‚Äôs at a balance of around -30,000!!! THEY HAVENT DONE ANYTHING TO HELP. I keep emailing them and they keep claiming that since it was made on my account that‚Äôs why I was charged, some bot or dev is not processing what I‚Äôm trying to tell them. I don‚Äôt need a refund but I DO need a balance back of primogens over 10,000 THAT I EARNED IN GAME. Seriously fix it.",1
"This game is a nice blend of exploration, dungeon crawler, and treasure hunting.   Between climbing, swimming and gliding through the air this game has many ways to experience the game.  First, the game really excels at solo an immediate friend gameplay.  (The game allows total stranger hookups, but it isn‚Äôt the strongest and doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense (turned this feature off).  
 If there were some issues that I have it‚Äôd be with some of the cutscenes that seem to freeze up during playback.  I tried to reinstall the game, but the glitching cutscenes continue to cut out.
Fix this issue and I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre good.
Look forward to further exploring the world and collecting the characters.",5
"Graphic better than any I‚Äôve seen on the App Store, an awesome story, unique and interesting characters and personalities, cool weapons, cooking, exploring, and no pop up adds. those are just a few of the awesome things this game does, but I only have two complaints (more like suggestions) it would be cool if we could have and be able to collect armor it wouldn‚Äôt even have to show on the characters in game just lower our massive hp and give us defense I beg of you, also I don‚Äôt one how some of the characters look and I wish there was a option to change clothes or something idk if there is a option to do that in prob not looking hard enough. Amazing game nonetheless!",5
"I don‚Äôt like open world games because I think it is boring and repetitive. I gave this game a shot because it was the same company that made Honkai Impact 3rd, the game has thicc waifus and lolis, and it is a gatcha game. When I played it was surprisingly pretty fun. The graphics are really nice. The 5 star rates are trash but I am used to it because I play lots of gatcha games. The character looks nice and unique and I even like some of the male characters. Right now my favorite character is Mona (I don‚Äôt have her yet). If you like gatcha and open world games this is the game for you. If you don‚Äôt like open world games or gatcha I would still recommend this game to you. Give it a try and you might like it.",5
This game is so beautiful! I am glad I have it both on PC and Mobile! I‚Äôve been playing this game since day one and fell deeper in love with it more and more as time goes on. The free characters they give you are good enough to beat the story and ok we all want the cool new characters that come out but you can save up your primo gems to get the chance to get them! It‚Äôs a gatcha game so ofc it‚Äôs about luck when getting units and gear but I think that‚Äôs part of the fun. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a beautiful F2P game that gives you the stuff you need to beat the game while enjoying an immersive story and world that pays attention to several small details that you‚Äôll be glad you noticed.,5
"While athletically very beautiful and with a great story. This is a GACHA GAME. They have lots of predatory LOOT BOXES and MICRO and MACRO TRANSACTIONS implemented to ‚Äúspeed your progress‚Äù I strongly suggest for people early on in the game to get out while they still haven‚Äôt spent money on this game. They also have an energy systems called ‚Äúresin‚Äù which limits what you can or cannot do everyday.  So while yes you can explore and have fun with the story once you get to level between 40-60 the content drought becomes more apparent. They give you a lot of quests and progressing for early game to keep the player engaged and focused. However as far as late game goes you pretty much have to plan what you want to do as you have limited resin per day.
Which is just another way of pressuring you in buying the loot boxes which contain character/heroes  and weapons.",2
"I have been able to play to the first city. The game looks wonderful, but it does not run well on my older iPad Pro. The starting white screen takes a minute to load the title (which is a terrible sign), and nothing renders after that except for instructions on how to start the game.

In game, the cinematics are incredibly laggy and stutter. When I‚Äôm able to move the character, I can only see within a few feet of my character. The entire background is black/void. Water is black/void. Lowering the settings does nothing for render distance except make the graphics more blurry. Eventually, you will get to a forced encounter, where the game does not render anything, and you cannot continue.

This seems to be the problem with anything but iPhone 8 and up and the newest iPads. If you have an older device, don‚Äôt bother downloading it until they fix these performance issues/bugs.",1
"First started this game with an open mind and was not disappointed at all. Although this type of game was not the first of its kind, key characteristics such as: aesthetics, the gameplay, and even the functionality of things were impressive. To make the game even better, I believe that controller support for mobile devices should be implemented. Hear me out, in this day and age, many gamers have moved on to mobile gaming. By adding controller support, you are essentially letting the community know that you care about their opinions while it simultaneously attracts more audiences to the game. Thank you and looking forward to the future of this game.",5
"So I was pulling on Hu Tao‚Äôs banner, and I had spent money on it to try to get her and I‚Äôm desperate because there‚Äôs only like three more days left and the wish turned golden and I had thought in my head. ‚ÄúOh my God it‚Äôs finally time I get Hu Tao!‚Äù because I had gotten the other event character and I wanted both of them. And I didn‚Äôt skip through it, but when I got to the five star character, it isn‚Äôt Hu Tao‚Ä¶ it was another five star character that I had already had and I very upset, and I feel like that, if the five star character on the banner isn‚Äôt in there you shouldn‚Äôt get another five star. This made me really mad but Genshin impact is very good game. I just suggest to just download it and the graphics are amazing. It‚Äôs a really good game in all. Just be careful of this.",3
"if you‚Äôre a white straight male p3doph!le, this game is just the right one for you! the company is extremely racist and all of the ‚Äústrong female characters‚Äù have the emotional depths of cardboard and are just for waifu material. 
this game is turning real world places into fantasy regions and doing it terribly- they made a region based off south asia and the middle east and it is extremely stereotypical and- EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IS LIGHTER THAN THE SUN?? the only black character is described as ‚Äúunruly‚Äù and implied to be ghetto, as well as a walking stereotype as being loud and annoying. 
they also whitewashed a historical african queen if that can‚Äôt make things better. 
they have pretty good representation for the region based off china, but for the one for sa and me? nah- they just watched aladdin five times and whitewashed everything. 
so, again! calling all racist p3dophiles who want a fantasy world where people of color don‚Äôt exist!",1
"The game is great and the animations and attention to detail is phenomenal. One big setback however is their lack of variety and depth when it comes to some characters. For one, some female characters are a bit shallow. Shenhe for example (spoilerish) her character development revolves around traveler. Given her backstory I feel like this sells her short. In terms of aesthetic design, the game is severely lacking when it comes to skin tones. There are only 5 tanned/darker playable characters (one of which doesn‚Äôt even have any in-game story appearance outside of events) and there are over 50+ characters‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs more skin tone variety with human enemies than actual playable characters and that‚Äôs extremely disappointing to say the least. Do better Hoyoverse",3
"I stared playing about two years ago and I truly love this game. If you play a lot it will get old while waiting for major updates to come out, but if you pace yourself, there‚Äôs always something to do and you don‚Äôt get stuck in an endless cycle of farming for resources.  Genshin seemed to lose its way a while ago when the storyline got weak and they added some unnecessary features like the house building and fishing mechanics, but with the new jungle updates the story has come back with a bang. And honestly for a free mobile RPG, I dare you to find something more aesthetically pleasing, graphically amazing and content rich.",5
"Genshin impact was an amazing game until mihoyo ruined it, the game was so fun to play it felt like a fairy tale, but then as time went by they game started to feel like any other game a bit boring. Yeah if you get a character you want you will be happy but it's been hard getting the materials for it and mihoyo hasn't helped us. Another thing I want to say are the sumeru characters are not the right skin tone, they should be darker or tanned mihoyo needs to change that and the archon of sumeru should not be a child yeah if you're a archon you can look like a adult, child, etc but you shouldn't have the archon looking like a child and mihoyo needs to change the fact that she looks like a four*. Mihoyo please make these changes.",4
"Honestly Genshin is so much fun too play. I could not express how beautiful the characters are, the scenery and gameplay is so so so so so beautiful. The graphics are amazing! The story line is amazing. The storyline can be so expressive and can and possibly make you cry. When you get to know and love the game you really get attached and appreciate the game a lot! As a free game you don‚Äôt have to spend money to enjoy it. The characters are beautiful and some of the character story quest are adorable! On my birthday I was listening to birthday voice lines and I wanted to cry happy tears. It made me appreciate the game a lot! My only issue is storage space but other than that amazing game.",5
"I absolutely love this game. I love the quests, I love the character designs, (The only thing I don‚Äôt like is Paimon, feel free to disagree) and I wouldn‚Äôt choose any other game to play for the rest of my life. I also absolutely love that you can wish and that the banners are different every few weeks. I love the map and how each character has their own personal story. I 100% recommend this game to anyone, even if you‚Äôre not a fan of anime because that is not really what this game is about. The other day I got a character I wanted and got very excited. I may be too obsessed, but I have a reason to be. Great job on this game. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Everything is great about this but I do hate that the bosses can just walk to a spot and randomly replenish their health, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a glitch but it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating. It would be understandable if you left in area entirely but if you‚Äôre still able to attack the enemy and they‚Äôre still able to attack you then it‚Äôs strange for them to break off mid battle, walk to their starting point then have their health pop back to max and start attacking again.
Elemental trials in temple of the lion are glitched. Enemies keep respawning including bosses and running out the clock regardless of how fast they are taken out. Extend the clock, lower the enemy count or fix whatever the glitch is please",4
"This game has a lot going for it! It‚Äôs super easy to pick up and pretty casual, but can also be somewhat complex if you want it to be and actually know how to read! However I don‚Äôt know how to read so I just push all the buttons and like to make everything explode with elemental reactions! Solid story! Like avatar the last Airbender if ange learned how to earth bend in 5 seconds from a fairy instead of a blind girl and never learned how to water/fire bend until the last season. It‚Äôs that and also the plot to no game no life where you collect chess pieces in order to fight god! I just made that last part up but it seams logical to me. 13/10 would play again!",5
"Barley started playing when the Baal came out. I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. I‚Äôm currently AR 53. This is enjoyable game, getting characters, fighting boss, exploring areas, and a story along with it GREAT LORE. This is very fun and watching youtubers and ect that help you out, is very generous. The community is some what okay. Players are willing to help when your a low level and just coming into the game. Coop is very fun playing with other players makes the experience very fun. I hate the event that just came out. I will forever hate it. You have to have a good build on character and for players who still not yet to know how to build its hard for them.",5
"So, I‚Äôve been playing genshin since it launched and I think I‚Äôm ready to finally give a review. Let me make this short and sweet for those with short attention spans. The game is stunning, beautiful, and fun. You would think that would be a 5 star right? No. WHATS limiting it is their ‚Äúgreed‚Äù for profit. It feels like they don‚Äôt even wanna give us anything. As a person who has played cookie run I honestly feel as if we should get a little more. In cookie run, if you get a duplicate of an event character you get crystals! And you get like materials for your cookies almost everyday. I don‚Äôt want to compare, but I kinda have to when it‚Äôs this much of a different in community givings.",4
"No shame to other games out there. There are plenty of other incredible games out there. It‚Äôs just that Genshin Impact is the one game that has stayed with me. Despite all the other games that I‚Äôve been playing for years, this game has been my absolute favorite amongst all those other games. Adventuring in a HUGE open world, getting stronger, amazing characters, amazing voice actors and music, playing with friends, and many other feature of this game have made me decide that I will still continue to play this game and will not stop anytime soon. Besides the amount of resin given, thank you Mihoyo for this wonderful masterpiece.",5
"This is one of my favorite games so far because the graphics are phenomenal, the voice actors suit each character‚Äôs personality, and you can play as any character you want and work with your friends in the same map! One major flaw that I hope that the game developers would fix is the crashing problem. Every time the character pauses or there‚Äôs too many things going on at once, the app closes on me (especially during battle) and I would have to go back and fight the same enemy as its health restarted while my character has some health missing. If this was fixed, I‚Äôd certainly give it 5 stars because this game is addicting but the crashes are the only thing that‚Äôs bothersome.",4
"This GACHA game is an absolute waste of your time. At first, you'll be sucked into a game that promises open world, beautiful graphics, amazing music. It‚Äôs true, the game has all of that. However, the more you play, the more you find glaring flaws in this game and just how greedy the company owning this game really is. 

So many characters come out with scuffed kits, which is terrible since you need to save for a long time or pay money to get them. The balance team is nonexistent. There is absolutely no end game content aside from spiral which resets every two weeks and takes an hour at most. Resin is a huge limiting factor and a lot of your character progression is linked to rng of artifacts, since they make or break your character. The story telling for this game has turned into a dating sim with horribly written storylines and terrible rushed pacing. 

Also, this game has a problem is censoring anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them. They are truly following the ideals of their motherland. 

Anniversary was an absolute joke and just goes to show that the company views us as nothing but promotion bots. The rewards are abysmal and there‚Äôs no communication from mhy about anything. 

Do not play this game and do not give the company any money. They do not deserve it.",1
If you are a player who wants to get decent anniversary rewards or in general this game isn‚Äôt for you. Genshin Impact is a game that barely gives primos to players for free. Most of the time you need good characters to do certain things. If you have bad luck too bad. The gameplay get repetitive after getting to a certain point. You have you unlock ar rankings to go do certain things and that limits what you can do. The pity system is pretty bad considering the fact you can lose the character you wanted in a certain banner but get a  guaranteed to the next banner or the current. Some of the bosses are also a pain in the but when you need to grind materials which is only from those bosses. My experience might not be the same as others considering the fact I was ar 32 but I hope this gives you a idea of the game.,2
"It‚Äôs a cool game overall,I have no complaints and I LOVE how you can collect characters and not have to pay real money to get them. To be honest,I love wishing and every time I can earn enough money to wish. ANYWAYS I like how you can play with other players and stuff. I do complain about how only one person can get the blossom of revelation (or something like that) reward. Me and my friends were grinding exp and found out only one of us got rewards. If it‚Äôs meant to be like that- then,it‚Äôs fine. But it would be a nice improvement! The reason I named it what it is named is because I cant download the newest update,it makes me so sad and it‚Äôs a great game!",5
"Update:  with version 2.0, I am sad to report that the game is near impossible to play as it crashes so much.  I can‚Äôt play domains, co-op mode, or change parties without the game crashing.

I love this game.  It is a lovely open world exploration rpg.  Very f2p friendly (but chip in and buy the $5 subscription if you like it).  My one criticism is that the game crashes all. The. Time.  Particularly when accessing any menu.  I once had it crash 12 times in 20 minutes while upgrading weapons and such.  Other than that, great art, fun gameplay, and engaging, amusing story.  

As you progress in Adventure Rank, there is a point where it gets grindy because world level automatically increases.  So if you are just running around having fun, the world gets too tough for you to live in.  You have to make sure to spend your resin every day to keep up.  Still, though, quite fun.",1
"This is such a visually beautiful game that i truly enjoy, which it‚Äôs pretty rare because normally I just get tired of different games that I‚Äôve played. But with Genshin there‚Äôs always some thing to do whether it be a commission, World quest, or even just a part of the main storyline. it‚Äôs a game that really can immerse you into the story and get you emotionally attached to really any of the characters because that‚Äôs just how moving some of it is. I would highly recommend this game to anybody no matter what you‚Äôre playing it on it is a great game. It‚Äôs also highly addicting so be careful because I know many times I‚Äôve stayed up until 3 AM playing it. :))",5
"I love this game, I play it every single day (usually for about 4+ hours). There‚Äôs only really one complaint that I have, and that‚Äôs that Mihoyo is kind of stingy with primogems. Like... only 10 for each daily commission? Come on! You‚Äôve made over a billion dollars. I think you can spare a couple thousand primogems for the players. The rewards are sometimes just super lackluster, and it can be a bit disappointing. This isn‚Äôt holding me back from playing, but it can be a downer sometimes. Anyways, love the game, and I‚Äôm excited for the next update. If you‚Äôre wondering if you should start playing, I definitely recommend you give it a try.",5
"I love this game, the lore, graphics and all are amazing. I love all the work put into each individual nation. But I‚Äôm having an issue. I cannot complete a quest (Tianqu Treasure Trails) because I did the puzzle necessary to complete it before accepting the quest since the area/puzzle already existed in game, and since a character involved in other quests is involved in that quest, I can‚Äôt complete Hu Tao‚Äôs story quest or the main quest. I get the feeling it‚Äôs possible to do the same thing and have the same issue with other quests. My suggestion is to make it impossible to complete said puzzles before accepting the necessary quest, or to make it possible to un-accept quests.",5
"I absolutely love Genshin! Although there‚Äôs one problem, for the ascending thing at AD 25... It took me about 2 weeks to figure out what I‚Äôm supposed to do. And so for that I feel bad for beginners. I understand that your trying to make it more challenging but you can at least tell the other Genshin players that when they hit AD 25 they have to do an ascending quest to be able to move on... right? But apart from that I love your game so much at first your ads were bothering me until my friend told me I should download Genshin over and over again. And I eventually did and I fell in love with the game (and most characters toüòçüõê)! But anyways thanks so much for making my life better love you Genshin! Goodnight/Good morning!",5
"I love this game. The graphics are great, character design is amazing, but this is the best way I could find to ‚Äúfile a report‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know if this is actually a report because it‚Äôs happened to so many people but I‚Äôm doing it anyway. I have been farming for Hu Tao for a while. Once I got 20 wishes I went straight to Wishing. I did my first 10-Pull and Xiangling and Chongyun (forgive me if I spelled those wrong). I did my second 10-Pull and saw a five star character wish coming straight at me. I got super excited, because might I add I had spent ten dollars on this game, and then... I got Mona. I think that is super, super un-fair because Mona has her own banner that I could have wished on to get her yet I still got her. I literally cried. Yes, I know Mona is a good 5-Star that a lot of people want but it‚Äôs just stupid I got her on Hu Tao‚Äôs banner. I feel super awkward saying this to the public, but to the creators-

I would request you fix this bug and swap Mona with Hu Tao.

And, in the future, maybe make wish events a little longer, because you do know almost no one gets them, right?

"Last year 2020, I had a problem with this  game everytime I‚Äôve played it, it would kick me off and I was stressing me out because I really wanted to play this game it looked amazingly cool. So I had deleted the app and download it back to see if it would work again. But! It was different when the game had finished for me and I wasn‚Äôt getting kicked off every time the person had talked it sounded like a robot like it was glitching or something and I had ignored it. But then the game freezes so I deleted the app and didn‚Äôt download it anymore until I saw it on tiktok and downloaded it again I‚Äôm hopefully this would work and by the way I play on iPad I‚Äôm not sure this game works on iPad.",5
"When I first started this game I thought it was simply a Zelda copycat, which isn‚Äôt exactly a bad thing, but this game has a ton of depth and support. There is a ton of content available, even to those who play for free. Plus you aren‚Äôt bombarded with ads every few minutes to ruin the immersion. 
The fighting aspect is very responsive and with the different elements coming into play, switching out team members and using strategy vs. just wailing away at the enemies is recommended, not to mention very fun! 
Whether you want to free play just to pass the time or want to dive deep and pay to get the most out of the experience, this game is great!",5
"First week of playing is fun and afterwards it gets super repetitive and boring. You literally do the same stuff over and over everyday and fighting gets super dull after a long play through. Also is it just me or is the Gacha super unforgiving? Rates are ridiculous in my opinion and when you farm primogems at such a slow pace, that hustle to get to 80 rolls is such a nightmare. Plus when you fight it hardly feels rewarding at all when the loot isn‚Äôt exciting in the slightest, this goes for finding chests and exploration as well. Don‚Äôt play the game, it‚Äôs fun at first but gets dull fast, play when there is more content and let me explain why... Have you ever heard the definition of insanity? Insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting an outcome. This game will define insanity for you just as it had for me.",3
"My phone overheats enough that I have to ice it to play, but oh my is this a game. Graphics are beautiful, character stories are captivating, and missions are unique and challenging. The open world has endless areas to explore, and updates keep bringing us more. The main plot is a fun story that has kept me playing for hours.
I would love to see more character stories that we can interact with in the open world in future updates, like you did with the intro to Razor, and maybe a way to work toward collecting characters I want rather than solely the random draw, but even still, this is an incredible game. None of its flaws are large enough to interrupt gameplay. Keep it up, I‚Äôd love to see more!",5
"So I just wanted to say this game is amazing. The graphics the gameplay, everything great. There are a few problems but the game is fairly new so you can expect problems with it. I was looking at reviews mainly the bad ones and most peoples problem was that it lagged and you couldn‚Äôt see very far. Most people who had these problems didn‚Äôt have the ideal specs like they had iPhone 6 or 7s and they blame it on the game. Also most of them say they have amazing WiFi and that helps but you need to have a good phone to play this game. I have a iPhone 8 and it runs perfectly no lag I can see very clearly and it crashes but not very often.",5
"Love the game. Paimon is super annoying, shut the voices off for a better experience. The reason I game 4 stars instead of 5 is this. The game is fun, but the wishes don't pay out well. Free to play players will have a very hard time getting 5 star player or weapons. You will get some, but good luck. Also there's just nothing to do after you finish the story line. Just grind and level up, but the truth is you only need level 70ish characters to beat the game with ease. The domain farming for artifacts is pretty lame, super hard to get what you want, you might have to hit the same domain 50 times and still not get it. 

A pvp option would definitely liven up the game for end game users and everyone else.",4
So I stumbled across this game a while ago I saw a trailer about it and I thought it looks amazing so when I saw the game on the App Store I just had to get it but now I‚Äôm extremely disappointed the is a huge amount of bugs and glitches 1 every time I play the beginning two cutscenes it AWAYS glitches and freezes 2 THE ENTIRE GAME IS BLACK THE WATER IS BLACK THE SKY IS BLACK I CAN ONLY SEE SO FAR 3 every time I have to talk to someone the game crashes I have tried everything to get the game to work oh yea also did I mention the fact that if I attack or walk in the water my character becomes completely white I can‚Äôt see a single thing when it happens how do I fight when I can‚Äôt even see please I beg of u to fix the game I have waited so very very long and physically hurts me to see the game like this so I beg of u please fixe I really love this game even though all of this is happening it‚Äôs still a good game maybe it‚Äôs just me or maybe it‚Äôs something else,1
"Genshin is an amazing game honestly. The world is big, there are many characters, and the gameplay is solid. Fighting is nice and fluid, but banner reruns are slow. The game is gacha game so be prepared for high investment and time. With the most recent addition to the game being Dehya, I am very disappointed with the game. All throughout Sumeru none of the characters impressed me as much as Dehya, yet Mihoyo released her in a state where she brings no value to your team. How could they miss the mark so much? The characters are the reason people play this game, so to have one release in such a poor state is very disheartening. I fully understand that not every character should be op, but this is downright sad. I am thankful that powercreep has been left to a minimal though. I hope Mihoyo rethinks their balancing of Dehya in the near future.",2
"I bought the welking moon today and when I bought it, it said purchased, but I didn‚Äôt get the first 90 primos and when I tried to convert my crystals to primos, it didn‚Äôt work. I also closed out the the app just to see if it would work but it didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm really sad cause I need the primos so I can pull for ganyu :,(

So a couple months ago I bought the welking moon once in order to save for a character. I only bought 1 welking moon but it said it charged 10 dollars which I know I didn‚Äôt buy. I know this because before I had 30 days left and after buying the welking moon I had 60 days left, but it still said I charged 10 dollars and I never got my refund back which is unfair. Other then that everything else is good.",3
"This game is awesome for people obsessed with anime and the fantasy genre! Which is exactly what I'm all about, I had this game before but it took up too much storage so I had to delete it. But now I have a new phone and can play it without really worrying about storage! Also, I love that there are ZERO ads! It one-hundred percent helps lower my stress and anger levels! I also love how easy it is to play, understand, and level up. Also one more thing, you never get bored because you're always on some kind of fun adventure, fighting off monsters, getting new characters, and my favorite part, getting treasure and new weapons!!!",5
This is a updated version I still play the game but I honestly hate the amount of space the game takes I barely have any storage for it like I just hope the game file space can reduce down. Honestly I like playing the game but with 3.0 coming soon there‚Äôs been shown lack of diversity in characters which is honestly disappointing many people are upset and all and like Hoyoverse need to start communicating more with fans to make the game better but it seems they just want to ignore and do what they want like it‚Äôs seems so racist how they will benefit other people cultures without good and non stereotypical representation  Like there are other CN games that do better at representing than genshin like it‚Äôs not that hard I myself am disappointed with the lack of character representation in the game honestly it‚Äôs so annoying Hoyoverse do better!!!!,1
This game is super fun and has a very interesting plot! you can wish by collecting primogems (obtained by many sources) to buy a fate my only concern is how much storage it takes. but I highly recommend if you like games like this I personally kinda forget about it all the time but then I come and play it but one thing I don‚Äôt really like is how long it takes to load when you update and when you don‚Äôt have any quests yet there‚Äôs like nothing to do at least for me but even though i don‚Äôt think this gonna be read I highly recommend this game to everyone ü´†even though my day is lost every time I play it,5
"This is honestly the best game I‚Äôve played! I sometimes tend too forget too play every day, because I still have school, but other then that it‚Äôs great! It can get glitchy sometimes, but that‚Äôs only when you have bad connection. I play on mobile & it‚Äôs really great! But like any other review, there‚Äôs some bad sides. One of them is the accession rank things. (the one that you have too beat a bunch of things too get a world rank thing or whatever it‚Äôs called, sorry I‚Äôm bad at explaining) they seem pretty easy at the start but then you get to the electro thing & it gets really hard. I still can‚Äôt beat it & I have some pretty good people. The second thing is when a hilicurcil falls off a Cliff that could kill it, it will respawn, which is kind of annoying. I hope this was a good resource for people who want too download this game! Have a great day! (Sorry for bad spelling!)",1
"The lack of diversity in this game is DISGUSTING this is a game about exploring different country yet it lacks, the white washing of characters that are based on real things is also DISGUSTING the fact that theres so much stereotypes behind dark skinned characters including enemies is a huge let down the orientalism in the new nation(Sumeru) is stomach wrenching. We asked for more diverse characters new skin tones darker ones and you give us TAN/DARK TAN CHARACTERS no character in this game is DARK SKINNED the only one closw is xinyan and shes full of black stereotypes, the email back to the players was a complete lie yall do not care about your playerbase whatsoever. Again this is a game about exploring nations yet make it look like u set a foot in the united states of america only every country has different kinds of people and you guys only make one, theres hardly even different shades of white.",1
"This game is overall pretty fun, and the graphics are amazing. I only have a few complaints. I think if it were a bit easier to level up characters it would be super fun. I also think that all domains should be open all days of the week. I stopped playing the game for a long time because of how irritating it was trying to fight Ei. And I still haven‚Äôt won. I would love to keep playing this game, but it‚Äôs hard when I can‚Äôt beat her. Please lower her strength, or make it easier to get stronger, and I would love to play this even more! This game is really good, but please think about these suggestions. Keep up the good work! <3",5
"Genshin Impact is a very unique game with very interesting storylines and I cannot explain how addicted I am to this game. I‚Äôve only started genshin a few days ago but since I have non stop spent at least 1 hour on this game üòÇ I definitely have been very interested in the story, I‚Äôm always so exited to come home and play genshin. It‚Äôs always so fun for me to complete tasks/quests and getting new characters like I said I‚Äôm still new to this game but at the same time this game is fairly easy to figure and is super fun! You never have to stress out about something and there‚Äôs always something to do! This is a definite 10/10 and I recommend! üíó",5
"Honestly, this would be five stars if it weren‚Äôt for co-op mode. Overall, Genshin Impact is keeping most of my friendships, well, friendships. It‚Äôs really beautiful, and the characters, um, you well get the point. 

I literally love everything about this game‚Ä¶well almost everything.

Let‚Äôs start with co-op mode. 

It‚Äôs really bad, not gonna lie.

Need some primogems? Wanna do a primogem domain with your friend? Nope, sorry!

You want to do a world quest? Nope!

You want to do that one really annoying commission where you have to give that dude radish veggie soup? Hint: Can‚Äôt submit item in co-op mode!

Do you want help with an event? No way! f2p loser.

Need help with a story/archon quest? Try again.

Do you see what I‚Äôm getting at? You really cannot do anything in co-op mode but artifact domains and material domains. You can‚Äôt even do every commission!

Next- primogems

After ar 40, (I‚Äôm ar 43) if you do your quests and actually do things in Genshin, you really can‚Äôt get primogems anymore, it‚Äôs really hard.

Glad I don‚Äôt do my quests I guess.

You can really only get them from commissions after that.

Other than that, it‚Äôs really good!",4
"Hello! I‚Äôd like to say something about a quest that takes place in inazuma. At the ending part once you grab all of the pearls from each small island in the region (watasumi island) you go to this place and you have to break all the seal. But once you get to the last one it doesn‚Äôt spawn your hydro monsters and you have to move one of each of the statues. And I don‚Äôt know if you noticed but that‚Äôs super annoying especially when the last seal is extremely hard to survive. After you fix it it‚Äôll let you move one of the statues from that seal and it works but if you die again you have to move one from each all over again. I want this bug fixed since it involves the upcoming update and it will be hard for players to enjoy the new quests without being frustrated. 

- Monica ‚ù§Ô∏è",2
"I love this game, but because I play it predominantly on my phone I would really love it if the camera automatically stays behind the character as I‚Äôm exploring or fighting an enemy, I literally die cuz the camera doesn‚Äôt auto adjust (like auto lock on) and I‚Äôm stuck having to move it around with one finger and the boss is killing me in the process. This minor adjustment I feel would be major to the games already user friendly format, thank you for this game. So much time and effort has been put in and it shows! Thank you so so so much! I stopped playing games for years and it feels good to pick this game up after not being a gamer for so long! Thank you guys so much!",4
"Ive been playing this game for months (on ps4) and its one of my favorites if not my favorite game. The stories, the scenes, the characters, i love all of it. The only thing i would suggest for new players is to take the game slow, i was the type of player who was really fast at completing everything and unfortunately at AR 56 have almost nothing to do. Thats why I appreciate the chance for not only in game events but ‚Äúweb events‚Äù as well, it allows you to see more of your favorite characters and earn in game rewards. (Though, personally i would like more ‚Äòfarmable‚Äô rewards ex:crystal cores, flowers, wheat, etc. and not just mora all the time.) also pls giv ganyu a rerun <\3",5
Some people are salty about the anniversary of awards no I can understand that they are bad considering we brought escape so high but I don‚Äôt really check on the anniversary that much unless it‚Äôs like new characters so I don‚Äôt really mind Anna the graphics are so amazing I definitely recommend it but there‚Äôs one thing I can ask for that I don‚Äôt relate mine because I don‚Äôt use bows that much but on mobile phones are so bad I have a pretty good Amer when it comes to bows on mobile but it‚Äôs also hard But anyways recommend The storyline is amazing and all the character designs are beautiful,5
"This game is really good, I have it on PS4 and it‚Äôs been a blast playing it, I‚Äôve been playing it for about a year now, but one thing that I absolutely hate about the game is the fanbase. I‚Äôm not a whale mind you( someone who spends lots of money) but the fandom has been extremely toxic as of recently, from arguing about how a character is black or not to anniversary rewards, it is probably one of the most toxic fan bases of recent years, and that‚Äôs saying something. So if you decide to play the game and favour your sanity, I recommend you stay away from the majority of the fanbase. Not all people in the fanbase are bad, there are some really nice people out there, but at this point it‚Äôs like finding a needle in a haystack.",4
"This is one of the greatest game to come out, which is also free. People are crying because the pity system is too high, but at least there is a pity system. These players have never seen something like Fate Grand Order, which didn‚Äôt have a pity system and you could play for a year without getting a 5 star. And you keep playing because 5 stars are valuable so I bet that even that you complaint about the pity system, you count down to the moment it is guaranteed. 
Stop been children over a free game, if you decide to pay, that‚Äôs on you. I love this game and would hate to see it go down because people are entitled.",5
"Great game! I enjoy playing this game and love using the gacha ü§ó! what bothers me is not the storage -because that‚Äôs reasonable, but the actual devs. they‚Äôre so harsh on the amount of currency (in this case it‚Äôs primogems) they‚Äôre handing out. I know that it would ruin the gameplay and the game would just fall apart if all our resources are given for free but cut some slack. on the anniversary we got less than a single pull, no wishes at all.
I‚Äôve been a player for quite some time now and I‚Äôve seen that some amounts are eh, but when I saw the anniversary reward i was kind of just concerned. But since that was a while ago and is not something for newer or other players to worry about anymore, I‚Äôll just rate the game.
üòçüëç
I think this game is so detailed and the quality- depending on what platform you‚Äôre using , is absolutely gorgeous! everything has an amazing amount of detail, and every character has a story!
the pity system is not the best,but I still find myself wishing either way. 
all in all, I find this game really interesting, and I can‚Äôt wait to see future updates ü§©",4
"First things first, Mihoyo, your game is amazing and is true my remarkable ! I really hope you continue updating this game :) But secondly, Anniversary rewards. Mihoyo seems to not show gratitude to those who‚Äôve been playing genshin impact since release date. This anniversary rewards are supposed to show how much you thank the community and how you love your fan base, but it seems as if you don‚Äôt care currently. Thousands or maybe millions of players are pretty frustrated about this and maybe at least some more primogems and intertwined fates would make this a whole lot better. Please do not ignore the community as though it will seem like you don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôre loosing many players and your game revenue may drop drastically. I really hope you guys would change things around but until then my review will stay at a 2",2
"I liked playing the Honkai Impact, so when I saw this coming out in a few months I thought ‚Äúsure, why not!‚Äù And I‚Äôm glad to say I was impressed with how the game played out! Well, for the most part at least. One issue I ran into that seriously impacted my experience was just because the game looked too good. I did my best setting my settings down to the lowest I could set them but there was still a bit of lag as though the device was still overloaded, I assume it‚Äôs because it had to load too many assets at once but to be fair I‚Äôm not a genius when it comes to coding a game, all I know is that the lag will get so bad the game crashes, and until that crash is resolved I‚Äôm gonna leave my rating at four stars.",4
"I‚Äôm AR55 and have been playing since last December. For how long I have played this game and for how much time i‚Äôve invested in my characters and spent money to obtain said characters, the developers of this game, despite now being worth approximately one billion dollars now, do not care about their player base and do not communicate with them. The game lacks end game content, end game rewards, and especially lacks new and interesting gameplay despite being out for a year with a new update every 6 weeks. Not to mention the latest story quest centered around Inazuma was terribly written and felt incredibly rushed. I love this game very much but for how much time i‚Äôve put into this game it all feels like a waste. There are other games out there worth your time. Do not spend money on this game and take things slowly if you truly feel you want to play Genshin Impact.",1
I‚Äôm literally obsessed with this game- me and my friend go on go-op mode sometimes and when we do we fight bosses/monsters etc. but sometimes we need to get something (say if I‚Äôm in his world) I can‚Äôt go to the shops. And I think it‚Äôd be really cool to add some form of trading! and maybe if it‚Äôs possible let other people (who join co-op servers) go to the shops in mondstadt like floras flower shop! Or Marjorie‚Äôs souvenir shop! And maybe even a way for players to get around faster! Like riding animals for transportation! Like how we ride on Dvalin ( like horses or something!) but that‚Äôs all I wanted to say üòÖ the game is truly incredible! I‚Äôm excited for future updates :),5
"So I have played this game on my mom‚Äôs phone with no problems. When I try to play it on my phone and my iPad it would say ‚Äúpoor quality of the internet‚Äù so it would not let me in my account on my phone and iPad. If you could tell me about that and why it is doing that, that would be great. I have tried so many times all day but it would not let me in my account. So if you could please help me, that, again that would be great! Other than that, I have no other problems with this app. The good things about it is that I love how it is easy to get characters, how it lets you choose your own name for your character, and how much detail it has. More things about it that I like is that I love how you can climb, how powerful your powers are, and I LOVE how the dragon looks. The dragon looks adorable. Anyways, that is my review.",2
"I love the game (just started playing) and right off the bat (brand new phone right from the store right off the brand new line of ‚Äúnew‚Äù) and this game destroys one. Your battery life and two. Your phone will feel like it‚Äôs on fire after playing for no more than 30 minutes. As amazing and great the details and graphics and story line. Amazing display,dialogues. I can‚Äôt help but be worried after prolonged gaming it‚Äôll destroy my phone and may possible even catch fire lol. For those that have older phones my hat is tipped for you and your suffering.- Edit- I must also add the extreme amount of space it needs (4gb to download and another 6gb later on in game) the space requirement is mind blowing",5
"Amazing work. I would recommend this game for any open world game lover, rpg lover, or both. And to all the people who is about to say crap about how this game has a bad rolling system, just don‚Äôt, because you can clearly win while still not spending a single dime on this game. You can also beat the game perfectly fine with the starting characters. You know how the starting character works. You literally have a free 5 star character off the bat. The rolls are just for people who want to test their luck for another character. And I can almost guarantee that even if you are free to play, you can prob get a five star character with the free amount of primo gems you get through the game.",5
"The game runs well and has a lot of good qualities, but they end up losing people because of the makers‚Äô greed through the energy needed to complete dungeons and bosses. It‚Äôs a shame since they already made $2 million but still couldn‚Äôt fix the broken regen energy rate for their fan base. 
If that wasn‚Äôt enough, the way the world scales makes it incredibly difficult and not rewarding to level your player level up. You end up not being able to go to areas you e already unlocked because the boosts the monsters get, and then you can‚Äôt level up your characters because you can‚Äôt beat the monsters you need the materials from to level up your characters. That discourages people from playing the game or discouraged from leveling up AR. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",3
"I have to admit‚ÄîI was a skeptic at first. Like many, I thought this was just a ‚ÄúBoTW clone‚Äù with the art style and transversal. HOWEVER, this game, despite being free, despite being a mobile game, is REMARKABLY better than I anticipated. I only started playing yesterday, but when I found myself surprised at how much fun I was having, I wanted to tell people. The expansive map, the interesting inventory system, the excellent soundtrack (which surprised me the most‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt gotten too far yet, but so far it‚Äôs really, really good), and a leveling-up system that‚Äôs complicated but not tedious, it all feels really solid. I would honestly recommend this game to people, it was definitely a pleasant surprise.",5
"This game is beautiful overall. It‚Äôs undeniable that the characters, background stories, and graphics are well thought-out and stunning. However, don‚Äôt expect much if you have any problems with your account. My account was hacked a few months ago and I have tried TIME AND TIME AGAIN to get it back. The replies were extremely slow. I filled out the recovery form they gave me the day I lost it, and they said it would take about TWENTY DAYS for them to respond. I waited a month and I never got a reply. I emailed over and over again asking, and they just said that it was still under review. This has been going on since February of this year to now.",4
"This game is great. Amazing character designs and I love how the layout is except with the main stories. I have a level 40 party right now and only had time to right this because I gave up. The thing I was fighting was level 31 and every time I was even a bit away or close to killing it, it‚Äôs health reset. I asked a friend whose on adventure level 28 and they told me theirs didn‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm not saying I deserve a oh wow here you can go but i think there should be a way to skip a certain part of the storyline. You wouldn‚Äôt get the chest or xp but I couldn‚Äôt get anywhere with this and i was at this for 2 hours, and that‚Äôs a lot of time for a single game enemy that‚Äôs not a boss. But again, otherwise it has perfect characters and a nice storyline to follow. And it‚Äôs even better because in a way there‚Äôs more than one.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since 2021, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it! The characters are fun to play with, the scenery is breathtaking, and the music is interactive and pleasant to listen to.
If I were to make one complaint, it would be the storage size. I play Genshin on my iPad, on which I have 60 GB. The game takes up 22 GB, almost HALF of my iPad storage. I know this is probably because of all the content and whatnot that‚Äôs part of genshin, but it would be nice if there was a way the developers could make the storage size more compact. I‚Äôll gonna keep playing (obviously), but I think it would help players in the long run if the storage was smaller.",5
"To begin with, love this game, I literally do play it daily. I got a Backbone to play this easier on my phone, though I usually play it on my ps5. Because of this (and a few other reasons) I got the Playstation version of the backbone. 

The one thing I'm a little saddened by is although I'm using the Playstation version, it still shows the Xbox button key, and I was hoping that there could be an option to show the Playstation button keys. It's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that would make a fan happy. 

Otherwise, your game is fantastic and I hope you keep up the good work!",5
"I first played this on ps4 before I abandoned it for months and forgot all the controls. After my friend started playing it, I got back in.
 I thought I was just gonna abandon it and be done but it ended up being a part of my daily life. 
It‚Äôs very F2P friendly (as I‚Äôve been F2P throughout the entire game as a qiqi main, with over 3,000 atk I might add). 
The biggest thing is how I started running out of quests around ar55.
I love the character personalities and designs along with the plot.

My biggest things about the game
1. Event only weapons and foods, I missed out on the cinnabar spindle, sealord, and kfc events so I couldn‚Äôt get any event specific things from there. A bummer but you snooze you lose I guess.
2. The Gacha system, this is just because I have horrible Gacha luck and as F2P my primos are very limited. 
3. Elemental reactions, these are wonderful but I want some more focus on physical damage for my Eula mains and people who just start out (and boy do those builds hurt.)

And because I‚Äôm writing this during a xiao rerun:

GIMME XIAO PLZZZZ",5
"This game is literally built of of breath of the wilds main gameplay components. There is little shrines you have to do, you get powers then you go defeat bosses. It would have been fine If it was just that but no, it uses the same rendering on the grass and water, and I know people are going say ‚Äúwell genshin came out before breath of the wild.‚Äù While that is true the game was completely  different back then. Nobody new it even existed until about a year and a half ago. Another reason I don‚Äôt like this game is because it makes bank off all the little micro transactions. My friend literally pays hundreds of dollars a month to this game, once he started playing it he wouldn‚Äôt stop. To this day he still plays it every day, he won‚Äôt even play with his own friends unless they are gonna play genshin impact with him. Honestly 0/5 stars if I could put it.",1
How the story is told is really good overall and I can‚Äôt really complain about HOWEVER the game is disappointing. Like most games anything works at the start so have fun but over time the game gets less and less friendly for band new players. Massive amount of characters need items that don‚Äôt even appear till mid game so you will be stuck with level 20 characters when you need to fight beefed up level 87 enemies when playing for 2 or more months it‚Äôs not much of an issue but endgame is depressing grinding a set of perfect artifacts is harder to get compared to a c6 character but when you pay I guess all your problems are almost gone because the battle pass is broken anyways if you like games where the main story is updated it only once a year have fun,2
"this game is such an amazing game, theres huge open worlds and so many characters! I am so glad I got it, the first platform I got it on was my PC, it worked just fine, but then I got it on my phone‚Ä¶ it won‚Äôt let me log into my account, it keeps saying bad network. My network is fine, honestly! I tried making a new account and that worked, it‚Äôs so weird it won‚Äôt let me log into my main account, it‚Äôs VERY annoying. Please someone fix it! And also once you get a higher ar it‚Äôs harder to earn primogems, maybe add it to domains or the ley lines? But other than those two things, this game is awesome! Definitely recommend it!!",5
I don‚Äôt really like to be negative about this game but the way I see the new characters for this game is getting terrible yea we got new location and we‚Äôre getting more lore but the characters on the other hand? Most of them look pale or down right terrible they had a survey about characters designs when everyone wanted more diversity more dark skin colors they just gave us pale characters and terrible outfits to some characters what‚Äôs the good side is they have the new location look amazing like it looks great I can‚Äôt for the quest and the music is wonderful but what makes it not good is they are barely anything good diversity of different characters I know they are working hard but they need to do better and the community knows it,3
On my first wish for xiao rerun in 2.4 I had a gold wish than I was so happy I was crying than I got a Mona. Are you serious!?!? I spent 3 months farming all those primogems just to get a frickin Mona Mihoyo please fix this ‚ÄúProbability Increased‚Äù all the time I have been playing the banners have been saying ‚ÄúProbability Increased‚Äù and I still haven‚Äôt gotten a 5 star until 7 months after playing everyday. This gotta be fixed mihoyo. Yah am back aye looking xiao‚Äôs back still didn‚Äôt get him. WHOOP WHOOP wasted my primos again. why does hoyoverse hate f2p I mean this game is driving me crazy istg if I lose another 50/50 imma flip out. I am not wasting more time on this game.,5
"It is pretty hard to get characters and build pity I‚Äôve been trying on Qiqi/Mona/Keqing, (standard banner) Arataki Itto, Zhongli, Raiden Shogun/Sangonomiya Kokomi, Venti, Ayaka and never got any of them. (in that order) I think you should add a system like the pity system and in the quests section on the bottom is gonna be a thing labeled ‚ÄúWish Count Until 5/6 Star Character/Weapon (you get to pick)‚Äù and more quests you complete including commissions and once it gets full you get your CHOSEN 5/6 star character/weapon.(when you get to reading this) . Have a nice day/night Hoyoverse, hope you‚Äôre staying safe.",5
"(EDITED VERSION) It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs just that for 1: the seelies should be sold at regular shop‚Äôs instead of special shop‚Äôs because now I don‚Äôt have one‚òπÔ∏è. 2: I really don‚Äôt like that there‚Äôs no slot‚Äôs so that way you can start over the game whenever you want to. 3: Is the characters, why wish for them when we can do quests to unlock them I mean come on, in the begin of the game you unlock a little bit of characters which is cool but I want them all, why not make the characters able to be unlocked by doing quest, because we already need to buy their new outfits why characters? 4: why is Aloy also a special event character? Now I don‚Äôt have her too, the same way I don‚Äôt have any seelies. ‚òπÔ∏è please guys fix all the stuff I listed. PLEASE & THANK YOU",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since late 2020, and its pretty cool. There‚Äôs a ton of stuff to do, and the overall quality of the game is pretty nice with such stuff as good graphics, visuals, etc. The story is pretty cool, too. The only thing I would like them to change is the fact that you cant get a character without becoming bankrupt. Primos can be hard to get, (the currency you use to wish for characters,) and the primogems in the shop are REALLY expensive. And even if you get the character, it would take months just to make the character PLAYABLE. And honestly, this game has became pay-to-win because characters are pretty important to stuff like battles. But overall, pretty cool game",4
"This games pretty fun, I‚Äôm still a kind of new player since a few months ago and lately after the 2.4 update there‚Äôs been a lot of bugs for me, for example the first bug that I‚Äôve been having a problem with is when I deploy my glider there isn‚Äôt any sound, then character voice lines when fighting wouldn‚Äôt play either, and now sometimes none of my sfx don‚Äôt work for a few minutes during fighting and using bursts, and with bursts I can‚Äôt see the ice orb ganyu has until after a few seconds of the burst animation stops, I also play on iOS if that helps, I feel like the only one going through this since I haven‚Äôt seen anything else about it :(",4
This game is AMAZING! It‚Äôs designs are great and very beautiful. I love the characters and how they have a story to all their lives. It helps you connect and end up wanting them more. The banners are a great way to get a character. I love that it gives you a month to gain primos or wishes.I download it cause my friend said she wanted to play together. I thought it was gonna give me the co op turns out I had to level up to get it. It gives you something to do other than the story. I really like the side quests. They give the game a little happiness. I can‚Äôt explain my love for this game and how it is very addicting and fun. This experience has helped my make friends.,5
"This game has gotten me through a bunch, and while the design and open world is amazing, we are only so far in and it‚Äôs draining my storage like crazy as a mobile player. I hope we‚Äôll be able to cross platforms soon, because I really want to continue playing (I‚Äôve been for a year) and it‚Äôd be difficult to let the hours spent on this game go down the drain. I have no room for anything anymore, I‚Äôve still been trying to clean everything up for the newest update. I wish they would take that into consideration a bit more, as for we are only on the third area and have just as many left.",5
"I LOVE THE GAME! But the only problem is, it takes up too much storage space! And for the new updates, it takes up EVEN MORE! I really like this game and I loved playing it. But the GB is too much. . . You probably can‚Äôt change it but, I would really appreciate it if you can please reduce the amount of space it takes up, I deleted almost ALL my apps except for one app and one game, not including Genshin Impact. I also deleted almost all my photos as well. And the new update is not working because I don‚Äôt have enough space. . . So those are all my concerns about this game. But this still deserves a 5 star review! Great game!",5
I hate this game so much I loved playing it but it would always crash when I things like fighting and waiting for the map to load takes 5 minutes it is the worst experience I‚Äôve every had on game I‚Äôve try playing on my phone to but it is also horrible with Wi-Fi on my phone and usual I would just re join cause I wanted to play now there is a bug that makes it so I can‚Äôt play at all when I join if I start walking I crash I click the button to with I crash I click to see my characters I crash everything I do make me crash and there is no fix to this problem for me it‚Äôs really disappointing because I use to play all the time but it literally doesn‚Äôt let me I‚Äôve wasted so many hours on this game even tho it‚Äôs trash the game is a total if you want to play it you new a new phone or iPad it doesn‚Äôt work for I hate this game and mihoyo,1
"I don‚Äôt know how to find a review I just made slamming the customer care and concern of this game only to login for the first time (in a minute) to find a thank you email for all the player support and 400 primogens it said 4/4 so I‚Äôm sure my little strike ended up with me missing out on the other 3 emails. Oh well, I still think MIHOYO has been stingy in the past with primogens and I hope this is a sign that they will hear our voices since we (I am p2p monthly battle pass and welkin min). Honestly just acknowledgment can fix the issue. People feel like you don‚Äôt care about them when they are completely ignored. This was and hopefully can get back to being MY FAVORITE mobile friendly GAME",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for almost a year now and let me tell you. The beginning isn‚Äôt super intriguing, I‚Äôm not going to lie, it took me months to really get interested. After seeing all the hype online I got back into it and I haven‚Äôt looked back. The game is intriguing and addicting and there‚Äôs so many different ways to play. 

However, it‚Äôs a Gacha game and that can be rather difficult at times, you‚Äôre not always lucky. But there is a system in place to make sure it‚Äôs decently fair. You can win characters for free but it‚Äôs easier if you‚Äôre willing to spend money.

All in all it‚Äôs a fantastic game, 11/10 would recommend!",5
"I love the characters and the beautiful, fun and intuitive gameplay. There‚Äôs so much in this OW game that you can play for hours and never get lost or stuck. It‚Äôs the best!!! You can advance as an adventurer throughout the realms (as long as it‚Äôs finished being built by developers, which the will show you in the map OR you‚Äôll try to cross and be ‚Äòmagically‚Äô repelled which I just love). As long as you‚Äôre willing to put the time in to scavenge and forage, nothing in the game is exclusive to p2p at all so I just love this game so much. 

My only issue is I downloaded the latest update and can no longer resume my play- I don‚Äôt know how to recover my progress. (*¬¥œâ`*)",5
"Because of all the reviews mine may not make much of a difference or you may not read it but since all the hate from the anniversary rewards, I have been thinking many people may agree that they have once wished on a banner or missed one and not gotten the character they wanted. Maybe  on a birthday or anniversary something that happens once a year, you can pick a banner you want. (Only on your screen) That way you get the chance to get the character you want. I really think that if you gave people the change they would really appreciate it instead of giving them everything they want. A chance would make anyone‚Äôs day.",4
"I really like Genshin Impact, and it‚Äôs one of my favorite games! I love the characters, the details, the regions, the gameplay, and more! I also like that the game is updated a lot and has many new things to discover. One thing though, sometimes I try to play Genshin, but it says ‚Äúlogin‚Äù. It makes me tap my email and then it shows the normal loading screen. I don‚Äôt find it that annoying but I want to know why it does that. And the maintenance is like-reallyyyyyyyyy long :,). I think it‚Äôs like-6 hours? And that is kinda annoying because I love playing Genshin and six hours is kinda long : , ). Besides those 2, I really enjoy everything in the game a lot! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll continue playing the game for a while.",4
"Let me start off by saying this game is amazing if your a new player, 100% you will enjoy this game if you like fun breath of the wild vibe open world rpgs. But once the novelty of running around, opening chests, and beating the game has worn off. That‚Äôs really it. The only form of end game content that there is permanently in the game is the spiral abyss, which is a series of mini-arena time battles that takes about 30 minutes to beat and that‚Äôs it. Done, for 2 weeks until it comes back. Everyone right now is raging about the anniversary but that isn‚Äôt the biggest flaw of this game, it‚Äôs the overall lack of a replayable end game, communication, and attention the the player base that is the problem.",3
I have invested so much time in this game because I truly believed it wasn‚Äôt a money grab but it has become one of those games where you have to pay to win. The luck system is garbage and don‚Äôt get me started on these events that make you work to waste your time. I‚Äôm not even able to enjoy this game as much as I used to. I hope whoever reads this knows that you won‚Äôt be fully satisfied and rather just stick to your old game. Also the anniversary event was utter trash!!! They could‚Äôve given players 10 to 20 wishes but they decided to only give them 40 primogems the equivalent to doing one mission. One of the worst if not the worst things this game could‚Äôve ever done to their day one players. I hope they listen to their audience and fix their mistakes before it‚Äôs too late. Games like these don‚Äôt last long if they don‚Äôt listen to their player base.,1
"Great game, the graphics are amazing, the quests are hard but fun, and overall it‚Äôs addicting. But... I have 2 aces and when I wanted to go on my main acc it said it expired or something and I tried to use my gmail and it said that it wasn‚Äôt registered and on my main acc I‚Äôve got to AR: 33 and it was so hard so having to start all over again is a pain and it‚Äôs so add to get primo gems and when your a F2P player getting to thousands of primo gems is hard and it‚Äôs rlly hard to at least get a 4 or 5 star character üòî
This is no hate to the game but people who spend money on the game get MUCH luckier and it hurts to see that I can‚Äôt even get a 4 star character. Me and my sister love this game it‚Äôs so great but please help us F2P‚Äôs ü•≤",4
"I love this game because I played for 5 months I believe, and then I deleted the app. And so I decided to download it again which is today and then I logged in with Apple. And they asked me do you want to download the full version and I said yes. And then the app said insufficient storage. And so I deleted some videos and photos, and they kept telling me the same thing. I was getting frustrated with the app. I nearly deleted all of my photo just for an app. Please can you let just keep some photos and videos and stop saying the same thing? It‚Äôs getting me really mad with this reminder because I‚Äôve tried and kept some photos and videos. Because there are some videos and photos that I refuse to delete. Please just let me try and download the app.",3
"I must say with the graphics and gameplay I am surprised that this is even a mobile game (yes I‚Äôm aware this available with other platforms). The only reason I don‚Äôt have it 5 stars is that their is a lot of lagging on my device to the point where audio is screwed up, sometimes the gameplay cuts and lastly the cutscenes get ruined because of it cause I‚Äôll hear the voices but the cutscenes are ruined since I know the animation of the characters are really beautiful; this is a really well thought and really fun game I haven‚Äôt played this good of a game since Epic Seven and Sword art Online: Integral Factor; this was really worth my time and effort as a gamer; thank you for giving us such a wonderful world and game to explore and experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",4
So I‚Äôm logged in with Game Center so when the update came out obviously I had to update it well after I did I go in all normally it says ‚ÄúWelcome Back Suga****‚Äù but when I go in it‚Äôs giving me the intro like everything al over again and I‚Äôm like wait what ? So I swipe off go in again same thing happens so I just go through with the tutorial all over again and I log out try and log in with Game Center but it brought me to the new acc and I don‚Äôt have my account linked with anything else besides Game Center :/ my user is Morchis029 and well i don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a solution or not but can someone help out üò≠üò≠ but besides that problem o recommend you download the game !,5
"Every time I dodge the attacks by moving the opposite directions during a battle with an enemy. The camera forces the character to face the enemy while being attacked by monsters. Which prevent from dodging attacks from monsters. 

If they cannot have an option to turn this feature off by updating the system of gameplay by turning off the ‚Äúpoint of view‚Äù or POV locked on the monster. This is a crappy game. This is the only thing that makes the game crappy. Everything else is great. I give it a 1 star because they won‚Äôt change this option.

If they update this game and have players have option to turn it off and turn it on. Then I will give this a 5 star rating.

I‚Äôve been killed by this issue of ‚Äúlocked on Point of view!‚Äù Which is a crappy game if players cannot dodge attacks because the point of view lock on prevents from dodging attacks from monsters. Especially when Ruin Guard does a whirlwind attack where it spins around following a character. Prevents a person from dodging and getting away from the attack because of the point of view lock-on forces a player to face the ruin guard which prevents from staying away during a spinning attack. Which causes to get a person killed because of the stupid lock-on point of view towards the enemy monster.",1
I first used to thing genshin impact was a joke I thought it was some weird knock off story mode. One day though my friend tells me I can‚Äôt hate until I try so I try and and my whole view on it changed amazing graphics for phone amazing world amazingly detailed and perfectly made. I really love this game and you probably will to if you just try it. I like how no matter what you do there is something that you can still do. I really enjoy the adventure in it and it is always giving you something to do whether it‚Äôs boss fights quests commissions and random world quests and I believe it‚Äôs truly well made and a 15/10,5
"Ok I rarely give reviews but this games blown me out of the water in the last 3 days. Playing between mobile and PC has been a breeze and the raw gameplay is phenomenal. My friend said ‚Äúsell me on it‚Äù and I told him ‚Äúimagine BOTW where you would unlock each guardian after each event to join your party and you can switch between em in combat on the fly‚Äù and so he downloaded it on concept alone. Not big on the anime style but luckily it hasn‚Äôt been full of overwhelming anime tropes. The dev‚Äôs have succeeded in building a game that‚Äôs meant to last. I‚Äôm excited to get off work tomorrow and hop back in, and I haven‚Äôt felt that with a game in years. Don‚Äôt skip out because it‚Äôs popular, give this one a shot.",5
So I love this app but when you actually play it like a lot a lot your gonna start knowing it better but the reason I left one star out is because that it basically is all your storage and I didn‚Äôt even have apps on my phone I deleted all of them because I was not playing them and my apps storage was really low but when I got this app the app thing was extremely high I was like I only have this app what happens and I was checking what would happen if deleted it and my app storage went down so that‚Äôs how I new it was this app but I still do love everything else about the app except for that part so I do recommend getting this app just watch your storage good bye :),4
"Genshin is a very good game and all , but I wish we had a trading system , so we can trade characters , weapons , food for other things ! üò≠üòäThis is also good because we don‚Äôt need to wait for few months just to wait for your fav character to be back , we can just trade other characters for your fav character that way it won‚Äôt be time consuming! üòÜüòé Plus we need to spend so much primogems on your fav character ,üò£ so why not just trade with other players for your fav character! üòÄThat‚Äôs it ! Hope the developer can consider this as a suggestion! Bye ! Happy New year and Christmas ! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
So ummm if anyone is reading this don‚Äôt judge my typing I‚Äôm only 8 ok anyways this is a very very good game it has good quality unless ur on mobile and has pretty anime characters and anime mommy‚Äôs everything u could ever wish for game play wise it‚Äôs very fun and the story is very interesting something like u and ur sister get attacked by god and u are trapped in a new world where u have to find ur sister while being followed by this tiny fairy that u might eat when ur hungry and ur hp is low the only complaint I have is that getting five stars is too hard I always lose my pity‚Äôs and I‚Äôm only 8 so I don‚Äôt have money for primos :( but otherwise very good game so ummm play it I guess and get sucked into the genshin rabbit hole like me :D,4
"This update was SO great, engaging puzzles, and finally an Archon Quest with no bland NPC dialogue. Every moment was engaging. Please, please more quests like this one. Moments without Paimon are a breath of fresh air. Not that I hate Paimon, but allowing us to have dialogue without her avoids that one-note feeling she provides sometimes. And finally some dialogue from our MC, more of that too Hoyoverse. I think the fans have long stopped considering the twin to be a self-insert, you have amazing voice actors for the twins in every language, PLEASE use them more! Not to mention the stunning animations and cutscenes!

TL;DR amazing new main quest. 4 stars instead of 5 because Hoyoverse can do more. 5 stars when every main quest lands like this one.",4
Genshin Impact literally is just such a beautiful game. It‚Äôs open world graphics is just outstanding. The lore and concept of the game is so interesting. Especially the music of the game‚Ä¶ I could listen to it for hours. I‚Äôm at the point to where the music is nostalgic. It‚Äôs just so peaceful. I love this game truly. I wish I could‚Äôve played sooner. The characters even have their own written stories and I love that. I love obtaining new characters and items. The sculpture of the land is amazing. I adore how each nation is inspired by a real state. I personally enjoy listen to the soundtrack of the game‚Äôs music. I wish I played this amazing game sooner. This game is just outstanding!,5
"How are you going to make an entire region based around a culture whose people are darker complected and not properly represent them? All of the sumeru characters are PASTY. Do not even bring up the various ‚Äúdark skinned‚Äù characters either, because they are NOT dark skinned. If you think Kaeya, Xinyan, Candace, Cyno, and Dehya are dark skinned you are delusional and do not care about people of color or proper representation. This is a huge issue, and should not be brushed aside because ‚ÄúChina doesn‚Äôt have brown people ü•∫‚Äù (which is absolutely not true, it‚Äôs just an excuse to continue to use darker skinned people of color‚Äôs culture without actually portraying the people). It‚Äôs honestly sickening how many people lick hoyoverse‚Äôs boots over this. These are grown people who have the ability to do research. If you aren‚Äôt going to properly represent the people of the various cultures, you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to profit off of it.",1
"I‚Äôve only been playing this game for about a month now, but it‚Äôs really grown on me. I play it almost every day, and there‚Äôs always something new to do! It never gets boring, and the graphics and fights scenes are incredible. There are many characters you can play from. If I had one complaint, it would be that most of the time I need to buy to make wishes to get new weapons and characters, but if you grind enough it should be less expensive. But overall, there is nothing like this game, and I recommend that everyone tries it out. If you‚Äôve read this far already, then have a great day/night!",5
"This game is one of the best games out there!! And normally I would give it 5 stars, but even the best games have big flaws. One in particular being the lack of characters with melanin especially in an upcoming region where there resides a lot of poc. If the regions of this game are based off of real world places then accurate representation is a must. Slightly tan characters are not enough. There needs to be change and Hoyoverse, if you want to reach a global scale then listen to your players around the world. Even the characters in Mondstadt I don‚Äôt feel represented by because of how light the skin is on those characters. I‚Äôm white but my skin ain‚Äôt pale as snow like theirs. Make new skin tones please! Not just pale and slightly tan. Reaching a global scale means listening to the people you‚Äôre trying to reach. Thank you. If this issue gets solved, I‚Äôm sure I and many others will give five stars.",1
"I genuinely enjoyed this game, as I‚Äôve been a player for over a year now, but I‚Äôve grown to become bored and disappointed with it as of recently. There‚Äôs so much potential that just gets wasted. New characters have become redundant and without any diversity in models and character appearance gacha has essentially become useless, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the low rewards you receive for the amount of hours it takes to play this game and unlock content. 

If you want to play this game and get good characters and weapons 9 times out of 10 it‚Äôs because you‚Äôve had to spend money to do so. Maybe I‚Äôll consider playing again when they actually listen to ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR /GLOBAL/ FANBASE. Which gives them the money to keep putting out these lazy releases of characters",2
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for almost a year now and loved playing it, it‚Äôs immersive and the storyline is great. However, I am becoming worried and a bit disappointed in the upcoming region of Sumeru. Due to the homogenous appearances in native Sumeru NPC‚Äôs with pale skin, I am becoming increasingly worried that the playable characters in Sumeru will also be pale skinned. Sumeru, based off lore and NPC clothes, seems to be based off the Middle East, South Asia, and other countries where majority of people are not white/have pale skin. It‚Äôs so disappointing to think that this region will not be correctly represented the way the regions of Mondstadt (Germany), Liyue (China), and Inazuma (Japan) are. I‚Äôve spent a lot of money on this game, but if the playable Sumeru characters released are all pale with no respectable representation of the countries it is modeled after, I don‚Äôt think I will spending any more of money or even playing at all.",1
"It‚Äôs a fun game good graphics, fun plot, but the wishing system.. I joined around the first Xiao banner and he was my favorite character ever since I spent the whole month farming and only got like 20 wishes. Then the next Xiao banner I got a similar amount and still didn‚Äôt get it which brings us to about now. I got 20 and wished and I got a five star! But it wasn‚Äôt Xiao so I looked into the pity system and at 76 wishes you have a good chance to get It but I couldn‚Äôt get 76 wishes in 18 days.. so I spent 65 US dollars which is around 65 wishes considering that I never bought primogems so I still had the bonus. And maybe this is reasonable considering that the average number of wishes you would use is 75 to 90 but Anyway I didn‚Äôt get it. 65 DOLLARS WASTED! I would give this game a lower review if I could but I can‚Äôt. Probably no one will even read my review so there's no point but.. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!",1
"This game has so much potential but literally every update they squander it for sales to fund their other games. They treat this game like it isn‚Äôt a global success. They don‚Äôt respect their players in the slightest with how they always ignore our feedback in surveys. If they still have no Endgame contact after Dendro/Sumeru comes out then its clear this game is gonna be dead before the year is over. I‚Äôm only giving three stars, one for the graphics, one for the music, and one for the characterizations. They lost me for lack of actual meaningful non time gated FOMO gameplay. Maybe I‚Äôll pop in once in a while to see how the story goes but I‚Äôm not hopeful of the quality after the Inazuma questline.",4
"Really love this game! I do, with my whole life. But miHoYo come on, you guys can generate infinite Primogems, and you only give us mora for your anniversary? You can‚Äôt even give us one 10-pull or a 4* of our choice? Enough about the trash anniversary rewards, the events they‚Äôre making are really great! The new moon chase festival one is super fun and I like the fish claymore. Most of the new events were for people who unlocked Inazuma, and since I‚Äôm trying to use my NA account more, I was not able to participate in most of them because Inazuma is unreachable unless you do the story quest, which I have yet to unlock. 
MiHoyo, please give the players enough primos for a 10 pull. At least you did a week login for some intertwined fates :D",4
"In my honest opinion this game is amazing, and  i‚Äôm not just saying that because everyone else is saying it. Ever since I got this game back in October of 2021, I‚Äôve been so addicted to it and everyday I find something new that keeps me entertained and to have something to do. I think it is so satisfying to wish and get the character that you really want but it is a bummer if you lose the 50/50. I love how this is a anime game and I just think that makes the game 10 times cooler. The character designs are great and the details are amazing. I recommend this game a lot of you‚Äôre into open world anime games and stuff like that haha.",5
"This game is awesome, but I have some problems. I‚Äôll give the good things I‚Äôll have to say first. I rlly love this game and I would recommend this game to everyone, and also I rlly love all the designs they made for this game but there is one problem that I have been trying to fix and then I ended up giving up because of it. The problem is I can‚Äôt download the full version because of little storage I have. I was panicking frequently about how I was going to fix it but I had no success I couldn‚Äôt find ANYTHING. This made me really sad and it made me even more sadder that at I deleted all my apps to play those:( I was super sad and had to quit because of this problem. I also had to download all the apps I deleted and logged back in to everything I deleted to Roblox and messenger kids. I rlly hope the developers see this to help me with the problem. Sincerely- A sad player",1
"Genshin Impact. The first thing you think when you first enter the game, is that this is not your everyday mobile open world rpg. And let me tell you. This game really does impact you! (Pun not intended.) There is a lot to say about the game, and a lot to there as well. From decorating a teapot you call home, to cooking meals, and battling monsters, this game is really immersive. The scenery and the soundtrack is beautiful, and the game has multiple characters with different stories, making them lovable in their own ways! I have already gotten attached to Kazuha. This game will really sweep you off your feet, so I recommend you try it!",5
"This game is amazing and has a very big map, big storyline, awesome characters, cool bosses. If I am going to be honest, I am very addicted to this game. This game is easily 5 stars and I play it everyday. I‚Äôve made friends who help me out in co-op mode to defeat bosses. Co-op mode is very useful when you first unlock it because you can have stronger players join your world and defeat bosses that you can‚Äôt beat alone. I don‚Äôt see myself ever getting bored of this game because there is so much to do and explore in this game. There is no actual ending to this game as far as I know from research. If your looking for a action packing adventure game I highly suggest downloading Genshin Impact!",5
"It‚Äôs a really good game, the gameplay is good, the characters are memorable, and the fighting style is good! Though the anniversary rewards I appreciate but I think there should have been more fates, but 400 primos in the mail, along with the new wings is good like really, it‚Äôs good! Anyways bye! 

Add on: I really do like the game, inazuma is like magical in some way, liyue is just a masterpiece, and mondstat is like home. The Gacha system could use some work but it‚Äôs okay. The characters are awesome in every aspect. And the lore, don‚Äôt get me started on the lore. The lore is amazing, as a book lover I always want to know the lore, the lore for this game is like a book series. And I love it. Anyways bye again. 

       - Emi",5
"This game is a joke and the devs are greedy clowns who get away with murder. This game does absolutely nothing good and the anniversary is an absolute joke. The end game content is a joke and the die hard player base supporting this game are clueless. The only redeeming quality about this game is the character designs and even that is funny because I‚Äôve seen better original characters from twitter artist. Mihoyo is a joke of a company and this game not good. In the slightest honestly. 

Mihoyo step up and treat your player base right, stop being greedy and cheap when it comes to the people who support you. 
As for the player base, STOP GIVNG THEM
MONEY THEN COMPLAINING. Some of you have only yourselves to blame for this kind of treatment and awful nonsense that the devs are doing. You‚Äôre giving them money and supporting their every decision only after your money is gone do you complain. Shape up",1
"I‚Äôve played this game since it came out last year, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was really fun‚Ä¶at first. Then the developers, MiHoYo, earned a lot of money with each new character that came out, and slowly stopped interacting with us, the consumers. Broken characters on release (in the bad sense) and no remarks on the first year anniversary of the game. It just feels too much like they are taking our money and running. Furthermore, I‚Äôve been unable to update the game on my phone due to how large the update size is. I close off this review by saying the game is fun to play up until level 40 and then all that‚Äôs left is grinding the game. There‚Äôs no good end-game content. So play at your own risk. the game is only going to keep getting bigger and if nothing happens, the developers will keep getting away with being stingy and pumping out incomplete new characters.",1
"I love this game so much, it‚Äôs really relaxing when you‚Äôre not beating the crap out of some new opponents. My only slight critiques are ; it does take up a lot of storage, and it‚Äôs hard to get primogems. I‚Äôm not going to bash the wishing system, because it‚Äôs a gacha game. There‚Äôs also chance. But you get roughly 40 primos a day and a regular wish costs 160. It‚Äôs hard for F2P players to play game or get a good chance to get a character they really like. Besides that, I love the story, the graphics, the characters, all that! It‚Äôs a very fun game. Though, if you‚Äôre new, I‚Äôd avoid the fandom since it‚Äôs a bit concerning. The game itself it great, but stay away from the side of the fandom that sexualizes characters, and all that. Love this game!",4
"This game has a really good story 
I don‚Äôt know if people can relate but in most mobile games even console games i usually skip the dialogue but in this game I put in my headphones and listen to every line it I feels like it‚Äôs own anime and I‚Äôm getting attached to characters
The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because they let you choose some dialogue as your character but it doesn‚Äôt make any difference in the story EX: in one side quest you have to get a present for another character you can pick what to give the options are flowers food or a book out off all this you give them a book no matter what which is kinda disappointing 
Overall you should really play this game it is genuinely interesting",4
"I‚Äôve always been into adventuring, and anime, and all that stuff but this game took it to another level. It‚Äôs so wonderful I really love it! I recommend it to everyone. That‚Äôs how good it is! And I‚Äôve been having so much fun playing it. The graphics and gameplay is amazing! The map is so beautiful every single thing has so much detail! When I first started, I knew I would fall in love with this game. It‚Äôs such a stress reliever honestly. It‚Äôs so lovely, I‚Äôm in love with this game. I have made so many friends along the way, and I have been unlocking everything! Everything in this game is an amazing adventure, if you haven‚Äôt downloaded it I recommend to do so.",5
"I started playing this game a while back and I was a bit worried that it would take up a lot of space on my phone and it would be boring like some other story/quest games. Boy was I wrong, this game is so fun. The animation is incredible, there are many mini quest and puzzles, cool cultural architecture and buildings, the characters are so very cool, and the main story line is so creative. In this world you can keep exploring and finding incredible things, and I cat forget to mention the recipes for the food( it looks sooo good ü§§). You can also play with people from all over the world! The concept of the game is just amazing and art is beautiful. I do really recommend trying Genshin Impact out. Enjoy!!",5
"Just wanted to say absolutely WOW! I am extremely addicted. Download if you want to experience the a fun time. One con is that it is quite hard to get wishes if you don‚Äôt wanna spend money. Soo it‚Äôs kinda easier if you spend money. But other than that it‚Äôs amazing, it has an engaging and exiting story that gets you hooked from the first cutscene. The areas are beautiful and each has there own special trait. Dragonspine had to be my favourite considering the realistic features such as shear cold! The enemies are fun to fight and the domains keep you busy. However the resin system also kinda stops you there. But it‚Äôs really fun for free to plays as well! As someone who is ar 50 I would recommend you download",5
"I found out about this game through an ad and downloaded it immediately after a quick glance at its graphics and characters. I think I spend way too much of my time playing this game, but I truly feel like I‚Äôm in a distinct, more fantastical and intriguing universe when I play. There is so much to discover, and I sincerely appreciate all the time the developers of this incredible game put in to achieve the quality of gaming that users experience while playing. The game runs smoothly since there is little to zero lag (only when the battery of the device is low, I‚Äôve come to realize).

Thank you, miHoYo, for this stunning game.",5
"Absolutely a fantastic game...and definitely the most fun I‚Äôve had on a mobile game since the release of clash of clans. You don‚Äôt have to spend money to be successful even in the end game, BUT spending money in here will have you breaking the bank bc it don‚Äôt guarantee you the best characters or weapons. I only buy the battle pass and I‚Äôm a free to play player myself. I‚Äôve been on for going on 3 months and I can defeat almost all end game material with ease. Some battles are hard but that‚Äôs on my part, not the game itself. The currency you can buy is given to you or earned very easily through multiple events they have. Get this game now, you don‚Äôt want to miss out!",5
"Let‚Äôs start with the opening, when the video started the screen would freeze and the audio would cut in and out like a broken record. When you get into the game itself the audio would be fine, however when you click on the mail for example the screen would freeze again, and you would have to either wait a wile till it finally unfreezed itself or exit the game and then go back in for it to work, for it to happen a few minutes later. Then there is the general lag of the game, like when your either fighting or simply walking. Having said all that the graphics are amazing and the storyline itself if good too, and the voice actors did an amazing job.",3
"I downloaded this game seeing how all my friends were playing it and I thought it was awesome!!! I think this game is wonderful. But‚Ä¶ it is a little complicated and hard to play on a phone. I ended up deleting it with a heavy heart. I really wanted to play more but it‚Äôs to hard for. The game is great and you should play it, but it wasn‚Äôt for me. 
  To makers of the game,
The game is amazing and wonderful graphics! A suggestion I have though is maybe let the player make there own avatars. I think people would like that. I only played the game for a little bit and there might be an avatar feature I missed, but if there isn‚Äôt you should totally add it!
Thank you for the wonderful game!",4
"I don‚Äôt care what negative comments you read if you read any of them. I have looked on the App Store for good games to play and I found this one recently and it took me by surprise. I have an iPad 7th gen and the game plays like its ps4. The graphics are amazing, detailed and beautiful. The game play is easy and fun. The storyline is really long and everything is free. It‚Äôs like someone handed me a free ps4 and said here you go play this game. I‚Äôm not sure how anyone could not give this 5 stars. I would recommend this game over any other game I have EVER found on the App Store. I want to thank the creators of this game for what they have made because I am just addicted now.",5
"Yes its totally free - i even have a 5üéñ already!!  I imagine the inevitable ‚Äúpay wall‚Äù will come later when you need staggering payloads of materials to ascend your characters and weapons.  BUT you can grind for those items, its that they give you more characters than you should level up maybe?  Already started saving back some level up and ascension items just in case i pull someone better than i already have...

Overall this is easily a top 5 game on iOS right now - I play most games for at least a little bit.  Unless you are one of those afk idle nerds, this is an absolute must play 

Side note - the PS4 version is also top notch - consider this a dual purpose review",5
"Maybe because it‚Äôs on other platforms as well, but I‚Äôm giving this 5 stars because it‚Äôs a RPG I can actually play on my phone, that‚Äôs not auto-combat, auto-quest, auto-run, etc. The game looks amazing and is fun to play, and it‚Äôs cool to switch around characters and run around in the big open world. I‚Äôve only done the prologue so far, but cutscenes so far are well produced. It does have a couple hiccups: Paimon is annoying but ignorable, controls on mobile are a bit sluggish (controls much better on PS4), and while there are teleportals in the huge open world, travel on foot is slow. Maybe as stamina increases travel will be easier, but I‚Äôm hoping there will be mounts in the future.",5
I love the game and love how it works but I am having trouble actually updating the game it keeps saying that I have to do something about billing which is weird because every time I try to do it I can‚Äôt because I only have one way to pay and I can‚Äôt delete it because I haven‚Äôt paid for anything and it says I have to pay for something on the app just to delete it and it‚Äôs annoying because I can‚Äôt even get on it to buy something but it‚Äôs probably that get you to pack and it‚Äôs probably just the App Store that‚Äôs making this happen but still gives really fun it‚Äôs really great you should get it,5
"I Love Genshin I play it everyday, that characters are fun to play, there‚Äôs so many ways to build characters, you can play however you want and at any pace but there‚Äôs one thing it lacks, diversity, most of their characters are very pale skin except currently two, and only two more are being added. The game would be even better if Hoyo included diversity into their characters and didn‚Äôt make every character they make extremely pale, other then that the game is really fun and tho it may get boring at times they add more and more to make the game interesting again and inspire more exploration and introduce more characters",5
"I come here to address an issue because while I think it‚Äôs talked about a lot I don‚Äôt think a lot of people take it seriously. The skin tone issue in this game is a serious problem, that‚Äôs the only reason I am rating it so low. The company refuses to listen to their players when it comes to this. And as an international company, Hoyoverse should focus on wanting to represent ALL players. Not just the pale ones. The only reason they changed ANYTHING was because the internet got mad at them. It should be common sense that when you are taking from certain cultures you should incorporate what the people from said cultures actually look like in your game. Not a lot of pale characters and a few tan ones. All the community asked for was more diversity in npcs and playable characters and we are yet to be heard by Hoyoverse on the playable characters aspect.",1
"The game is fun and interactive and honestly kind of aggravating at some times with some things but thats just me personally and no one else deals with it, but i feel like trading characters could be a really cool idea like if you get to adventure level 30 or something like that you can start trading characters with other people so that everyone can get the characters they want, like if someone has a zhongli and someone has a venti and the 2 want the others character they can trade for it which adds another reason to summon as much as you can just incase you get a character someone else wants that you have and they have a character you want just a thought",4
"I started playing Genshin Impact almost 2 years ago. The storyline is great, but I wish they added more drama and excitement to the stories. Building the characters is pretty annoying (because it takes months to make them useful), but it‚Äôs also fun. Another annoying thing is trying to get the 5 star character that I want. For me, it takes a very long time to save up enough wishes, and when I use those wishes on the banner, I usually don‚Äôt get the character I want. Spending a whole lot of your time and effort on a game, just to get nothing is pretty bad. Mihoyo should increase the probability of winning the banner.",5
"I like the game overall, but you really can't look past something like how they portray Sumeru's characters. Sumeru is a nation based off the Achaemenid Empire, a region with diverse cultures and skin tones.

The region isn't even out yet and it's already unbelievably disappointing to me as a south asian person. All the NPC's from Sumeru are pale and so are the confirmed Sumerian characters (Collei, Cyno). Pale people from the SWANA/South asia region exist, but not everyone from there is pale. The fact that every single one of the MANY Sumeru NPCs are paper white, many with light hair aswell, isn't because they want to represent pale people from that region. It is a matter of colorism, and it's frankly disgusting and disappointing.

Not to mention the fact that every single nation is based off one real life nation. Except Sumeru and Natlan, the only nations based off of black and brown cultures. They are said to be based off a mashup of different, completely separate cultures. It seems to me that Hoyoverse finds our cultures interchangeable, which is not okay at all. It's textbook orientalist.

It's a great game besides the racist and colorist issues at its core. If Sumeru comes out and is as disappointing as I'm lead to believe, I doubt I'll continue playing or recommending Genshin Impact to others as I have in the past.",1
"I used to genuinely love this game and the world it‚Äôs in but after playing for a year and a half I‚Äôm just tired of the lack of representation in the game. The gacha system and grinding system are already bad enough and I learned to tolerate that but the fact that the game is covering a country based on the Middle East and still can‚Äôt add a smidge of melanin to any of its characters is just sad. Out of all the characters there are only two darker skinned ones and even then they get white washed all of the time. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where one of the characters, Kaeya, whose dark skinned, is barely ever seen as Indian anymore. They whitewash him in game too over the updates. In a Game where magic, witches, slimes, hilichurls, and monsters exist the team behind it should not be actively avoiding representation for the bipoc community. Racism doesn‚Äôt even exist in tevyat so why should racism Influence the game?",1
"It‚Äôs really not a bad game, but it takes too much storage. I have a 64GB iphone and this game it literally 20GB of it, plus 3-5 more GB bc of the new 2.7 update. I don‚Äôt have enough storage anymore and I‚Äôve already deleted most the things on my phone. I‚Äôm close to deleting the app bc of how much space it take. Another thing is how it starts to get boring later on. It‚Äôs not the plot or events, it‚Äôs just when you‚Äôre all caught up and you have nothing else to do. You need friends or people to play online with you to keep the fun in it. Last thing, don‚Äôt complain about how much money you spent because of a lowkey rigged gacha game. No one told you to or asked you to spend money on the game, this is coming from a person who HAS spent money.",3
Me and my sisters want to play the game but there is a problem the game has a new update right and it won‚Äôt update because of lack of storage plus this is a new device and has barely anything on here and all I‚Äôm just saying is that this app kinda takes up too much storage on my device I‚Äôm not trying to hate on the game but it just won‚Äôt let me update it because of lack of storage even though it won‚Äôt let me download the game this app is really amazing and has really really good quality and very very amazing characters that‚Äôs all I have to say I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug or something but I just wanted to let this out Ty! :),4
"While the game and characters produce an amazing experience for gaming, things do get boring really quickly. You‚Äôll have to fork out a lot of $ for the specific characters you want, and then finish the story quests only to see you‚Äôre now AR50, and there‚Äôs 1 hours worth of entertainment left in the game. Do this enough and you realize you spent money to die of boredom. The costs for characters limit you from a full experience, and the limited resources you acquire per day further will put you in the negative. Most yt content creators complain about this and the developers after a year, won‚Äôt do anything about these basic things. If you‚Äôre new and searching for a good game, choose this one but don‚Äôt spend. 2 months later you will move on out of sheer boredom.",2
"AR: 43. I had so much magic in the beginning. It was so captivating and beautiful. You had your source of primos for a while. But now‚Ä¶ multiple banners at once. Our F2P community is shrinking. Things aren‚Äôt the same. The lands are seeming to get less- I don‚Äôt know how to say it. My only source of primos is commissions and rarely events. I don‚Äôt have quests for them. When I do, they are way too hard. Venti, Zhongli, And  Ei, Magic still exists when you did the quests but they are fast. The memory of completing them and being so excited still grabs me in the middle of the day and makes me excited for the next land. Also, can Genshin Impact come for free to Nintendo Switch? Thank you for reading.

- Just Another Lumine Main",4
"I'm going to be completely honest, this game has gotten me through a lot in the past year. (I started in early June 2021) So, I might be leaning into my favor of the game, but I love it.  It's engaging and there is a constant stream of new content to engage with.  For the most part, the game is very relaxed.  The over-world exploration is always fun, and even today I find new things I missed in prior run arounds.  The characters are all given fairly well developed stories that are pretty fun to play through.  Of course, the game has it's problems, and I've gained a lot of restraint with not spending too much money through the gatcha system...  Very fun game though!",5
"3.5GB is only the demo. False advertising much? Insane amount of storage needed for this. Devs need to get rid of the annoying cutscenes (that freeze up anyway) and some of the drawn out ü•±dialogue (including the worst sidekick in gaming history). 

Current End game is full of nothing to do except wait for next event that will probably take player very little time to complete. üò≠ 

Camera is terrible. In battle camera gets lost in walls, rocks or whatever is currently in surroundings causing player to lose all sense of direction and take serious damage. Players also get stuck in corners or against rocks if they are launched never allowing their feet to touch ground. Being in a constant fall position while in battle is definitely a health hazard. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",3
"This game is amazing. I absolutely love this game, the characters, the gameplay, everything is amazing. If I would to compare this game to other games I would definitely give this game at least in top five as one of the best games. However there is lots of problems. I play this game on my iPad (model iPad) and when I play I experiencing a lot of problems. On the device I play, it lags incredibly. The game also crashes so much. I recorded my data, and I found out that for me at least this game crashed 5 times within 30 minutes. It literally makes this game unplayable in combination to the lag. I love this game so much and it has by far been one of the best games I have ever played, but this game is near impossible to play for me.",3
I got the game because it was popping up all over the place so I thought I would try it since I had enough storage‚Ä¶.. I selected to download the full app and I didn‚Äôt have enough storage so I deleted and reinstalled it and didn‚Äôt click on the full game and played the demo after got some more storage free what I thought was enough to download it it said I didn‚Äôt have enough storage I did the math to free up 8GB but looks like my math was wrong and I dont want to delete anymore things but it was a good game to be honest just had to offload everything else trying to get the full game. It would be nice if anyone was to tell me the exact amount of storage I need free please and thank you,4
"Genshin Impact is probably the most fun and entertaining game I‚Äôve ever played. Not to mention, I have to take the SHSAT (test to get into a specialized high school) and I am extremely nervous. I got this game last night and have not stopped playing since.

Although it earns the max of five stars from me, I think it could get some criticism!

1. Quests often take a long time to appear for me, and sometimes quests that aren‚Äôt even at my level challenge me to complete it.

2. Controls in the game are often confusing for me as a beginner, and I find it difficult to navigate with all the buttons and requirements.

3. Last but not least, I‚Äôve had a glitch happen multiple times where I try to attack a humanoid/monster and even when it says they took damage from my attack, their HP are still at the max. It‚Äôs annoying but not a problem as it only happened a few times!

Overall, Genshin Impact is an absolute masterpiece, with beautiful scenery and amazing characters, it deserves to be named the best game ever to be created!",5
"The game isn‚Äôt too bad, rather fun to play with an amazing story, amazing characters, and some beautiful scenery. I enjoy playing it, and the events they have at times aren‚Äôt too shabby. Granted they sometimes have their hiccups, but overall their pretty good. I hope to continue playing this game for a long time as well as seeing what new things come out as well as how the story progresses. Mihoyo, your doing really good so far. Please keep up the good work as well as the voice actors as I hope to see where you take this game and how far it can go and sorry for those of us who have treated you and the voice actors so rudely.",5
"It is one of the best gacha game so far, in my opinion they should add more rewards when something big comes up. For example when we get to rank 60, we only get 150 primo gems. The gameplay is amazing and the fighting style for each character is really cool. This game really has a special place in my heart although I really wish they gave us a whole 10 pull when a banner comes out. Also I apologize for all the used to be fans leaving for cookie run, it is completely unfair how they changed so quickly. I am not trying to send any hate towards the game. Overall great game, the rewards could use some work though!!",5
"I cannot believe this game is able to play on my mobile phone. It‚Äôs the most beautiful and addictive game I‚Äôve played. It‚Äôs Breath of the Wild meets Dragon Age Inquisition. Solid soundtrack. Fighting system is amazing. Lore and world exploration is the best outside of a console or computer game. This blows all other mobile rpg games away. This is a Gacha game though. For those that don‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs a mechanic in the game that allows you to gamble for better characters/items through purchases. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to spend to win, but if you want the best stuff and you want it fast then yeah, it pretty much is. But so worth playing",5
"the characters, the maps, the events, everything is just so charming. the hefty size is understandable because the game is so high quality. they put amazing detail into everything and make all the characters so unique and interesting. it‚Äôs not just all looks, either, because the combat system is quite engaging as well. even how the hilichurls and other enemies make different sounds, all of the details are so well put in and made. the artifact system is incredibly helpful as well, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen anything like it in a long time. all in all, amazing game, 10/10 recommend.",5
"No communication from mihoyo except for automated posts about community events. Zero sense of anything being different during the anniversary. It could very well be any other day because there is no in-game reference to the anniversary. The rewards are laughable after a whole year or so much player support. There is no sense of appreciation from mhy and no substantial rewards. Overall game is a 3 or 4 because they refuse to buff or fix any problems with chars, communicate with players in general, and the prices for primogems are way too expensive. Spent about $350 so far but will be going back to being f2p because there‚Äôs too much corporate greed to support them. I feel bad for the players that spent thousands or even tens of thousands. Also for all players in general because everyone loved the game and played the game religiously for them to be absolutely spit on.",1
"This game is simply okay. The characters are cute, the art, music and backgrounds are nice, but the company can be pretty crappy, and the game can get confusing. In order to get good character stats and deal a decent amount of damage you have to understand how to deal with the artifacts.

On top of that, Genshin Impact is what made Mihoyo rich, it‚Äôs their main source of income.. but they treat us very poorly. It‚Äôs been a wonderful year with them, their sales skyrocketing, but they can‚Äôt even give us enough gifts to get a guaranteed five star? They purposefully make their gacha system a bit tricky to maneuver, but then give us a simple 10 pull ‚Äî which 9/10 times wouldn‚Äôt even get us our wanted 5* character.

Please learn treat your players right, or else you will lose them.",3
"I know this is not very important‚Ä¶ but this is my opinion, I love everything abt the game!! The one thing I dislike is that u can change the person u play with.. when u meet a new character u can change into that same character‚Ä¶ some might like it but i don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I like to stick with the character I choose to be and play with, I want to get to know the character I want to be! But this is my opinion! But other then that this game is absolutely amazing! U can do whatever u want! And do ur own quest when u feel like doing them. And man the hole game is absolutely beautiful, very detailed very real! I like games like this when u can roam freely, and do whatever u want!!! Well this is my opinion!!",4
I downloaded this game a month or two ago and I can not stop playing it! It is so much fun and has such great story and has an amazing idea around it characters with different classes and elements and being able to build your dream team and with updates every few weeks this game is just so much fun! It is also very well made since it has very good graphics and I have not myself found a bug or glitch in the game which makes the game even more enjoyable and good to play! I hope the devs keep updating and improving the game and also adding new characters. I do have one recommendation add a dendro character!,5
"I‚Äôm a fan of the game who‚Äôs been playing for months now, but I can‚Äôt download the newest update. I keep getting the same message, saying I have to download the newest version to continue, where I‚Äôm sent to the App Store to hit the update button. Every time I hit the button, the app successfully updates, but then I open the app and get the same exact message.
Devs‚Äî Please fix this soon. I really am a fan of the game, but I can‚Äôt play right now, and I‚Äôm going to stop playing if there‚Äôs no way for me to. Since it seems like others are having this problem, you might lose a lot of players.",5
"This took forever to load ‚ú®‚ú®and this made my day even worse...because I got divorced,üòÅüòÅüòÅ I also got fired for fake being sick.

Thank you so much for reading my reviewü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó",5
"This game is so unique and the best RPG game I‚Äôve ever played. It has so many unique characters, abilities, and all different styles of how each play! It is truly amazing to see all the different types of little details this game has! For example, the footprints and the burning flames in the grass that leave it turning a different color. It has many bosses to defeat, artifacts, and domains that you can do! I am very surprised this game is free when it has so many features that are so unique and magical! The different fighting styles and weapons have me astonished! I truly adore this game, please get it if you are doubting if u should, you won‚Äôt regret it!",5
"First off the review i saw complain about the chests and saying there isn‚Äôt a reason to explore anymore... thats not true! Different missions and things you need to level up characters still reside in places that we‚Äôve been to before there‚Äôs always a reason to explore! 
The only problem i have is after main missions in the beginning it lags hard even with the graphics low but i still really enjoy the game. Its so addictive and i played this game nonstop and even during school hours! 
When it isn‚Äôt lagging, the game is actually very beautiful and well developed ! If you havent tried this game I recommend it ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"The roles are unbelievably hard because the odds are not really good. Also I tried to cross save with the PlayStation from mobile and there is no way to do that yet I hope that will be fixed in the future or technology will be far greater.

 Genshin impact is an amazing game the graphics are amazing, for one it‚Äôs free. The story is amazing. Only problem I have this game is the save file and the unbelievable pay to win style even though you can actually get  every thing without having to pay you just got to keep trying

Also in the future can there be more events in the future where you can get a free character for doing an event  all the way though to completion like the meteor shower event where you got a free character for doing everything. It was a four-star nonetheless but it was actually a good character with amazing abilities 

My four-star reviews not for the odds it‚Äôs just for the save file I love the game I constantly think about it to the point where it‚Äôs always on my mind. I just wish I can transfer my safe file from my mobile to my PlayStation.",4
"This game is so much fun and very addictive to play. The story line, character design, the overall aesthetic of the world design are very detailed and stunning. My only complaint about the game is that it every now and then crashes or sometime just freezes in the middle of the game. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because of my phone or because of the game. But I can somewhat overlook these problems because the game is so much fun that I don‚Äôt let it bother me too much (although I would like to see these glitches fixed). Can‚Äôt wait to see what more 5 star characters are released in the near future. God knows my wallet is suffering at the hands of 5 star Waifus lol.",5
"this is an amazing game and I would rate it 5/5 but just be warned there are some cons. 1st off it has a lot of details and graphics so it wont run well on an old ipad ( 3+ years ) and if you only have 16 amount of storage you should get a different game. although it says it'll only take away 3 you need to download the stuff in it meaning its gonna be more than double I don't remember exactly but anywhere between 8-12 which is a lot. its best for pc but then I'd say ipad if its a new and good ipad with decent storage (32-64) if not ipad then phone, it depends on preference and what you are used to. I wish you could get it on mac but I dont think you can.",5
"Their is a lot of lag when I go to another area of the map and it takes 2 minutes to load all the stuff like mobs and buildings, sometimes I worry if i passed a chest because it hasn‚Äôt loaded and when items drop from mobs,chests etc. it takes a while to load. When I click on any of the icons it takes a while to load and when I start a mission with the timer the mobs take a while to load and by the time they spawn the timer is already gonna end and I‚Äôll have to redo it a lot of times. After playing for 30-50 min it kicks me out of the game. The wishes cost to much. The art work and characters are amazing good quality when they do load. Thank you for your time. üôèüèΩ",4
"These reviews are incredible. I wonder how many people actually don‚Äôt realize that this game is a copy of breath of the wild. Yes of course it is a good game. I feel kind of sad for those who have not experienced breath of the wild first, which, is a beautiful game by the way.

Of course it‚Äôll be laggy, because the main botw map was intended for the nintendo switch rather, and not a mobile game. It‚Äôs a bit upsetting knowing the game style; map and such as was copied and yet sits here free to use even; despite the rest of the game being original, breath of the wild definitely deserves credit.

Other than that the game is cool and I like the concept, props to the makers but I hope this game doesn‚Äôt overshadow the creativity and beauty of breath of the wild, and I hope it is known.",4
"I rarely write reviews, as I find most games to be barely worth the time. However Mihoyo has outdone itself a second time. Honkai Impact 3rd was and is one of my top games, but this edged itself ahead. Beautiful graphics, breathtaking music, fun and simple combat (yet challenging to master), engaging characters and storyline all play to its strengths. There is no sense of pay to win or pay to play.

If I were to call out a weakness, it would be that the dailies are a bit too time consuming with the ‚Äòspend original resin‚Äô aspect, which I struggle to complete.

I am thankful for Mihoyo games as I have been under extra social distancing due to cancer, they have made the time much less difficult. Thank you!",5
"If the Resin system isn't significantly improved by the 1.1 patch, this game is going to fall off very quickly. We need more ways of obtaining Resin by playing in-game, so that we can progress at our own pace instead of being throttled and cut off after our first 20 minutes of gameplay. I'm not joking when I say the only significant portion of progression you gain from playing each day is at the first 10-20 minutes of gameplay when you do your daily commissions and spend your Resin, and after that you get hardly anything worthwhile. Making all of the chests respawn each week would also help with this, as the open world feels completely empty after you've gone through each area once or twice, and it doesn't require any Resin. This game has a ton of potential but if MiHoYo doesn't bring change to things like Resin soon then they're going to lose their playerbase fast.",1
I‚Äôm having trouble playing this game when I first got it I was wondering why there was a black screen every time I played it kept doing that every time I wanted to play it‚Äôs very difficult for me to see where everything is cause the water and sky is completely black sometimes my character is like that but after the game updated i saw a little of the sky than it just started skipping than went black again and stayed like that. I love this game it‚Äôs so much fun but sense this is having trouble with a black screen I can‚Äôt rlly play and get the experience to see everything and try to do tasks. Plz look into the bug of the black screen thank you.,5
"It‚Äôs easy to hyper fixate on the game every few updates but I find that for f2p players you have to be really into all the details and lore behind it to stick to it, I grind for a good 2 weeks but then it starts to get boring. The story and characters are still everything but earning wishes takes a long time so it isn‚Äôt my go-to game when I‚Äôm bored. The graphics, music, characters and creatures are gorgeous nonetheless so it‚Äôs nice to come back every once in a while :)

Would love to see more dark skinned characters though, I thought things would be better with cyno but it seems he was ‚Äúwhite washed‚Äù in a way.

Lovely game could be better !",4
"This game is overall great with the anime aesthetics, quality characters, and has great potential. However, once you get through the honeymoon phase and get to a certain Adventure rank, you hit a wall that is mainly caused by the resin system. This severely limits your progress in the later parts of the game. I know this is a gatcha game, so that includes some energy system. However, the game does not give much options to recharge your resin besides having you spend money. I would be happier if they added other ways to recharge resin. Such as when you rank up your Adventure Rank, complete all your daily commissions, and allow us to go over the cap. Also the 5 star rates are waaay to low. if they added ways for f2p players to obtain 4 and 5 star characters easier, it would be amazing.",3
"I think this review will help a lot of people and yes the main question asked is, if it‚Äôs pay to win. It‚Äôs sort of but also not. You only want to pay if there‚Äôs a specific character you personally like.  But they give you a lot of free stuff like free gems and free characters also throughout the story. They are pretty nice. Most of my characters r 4 stars so i don‚Äôt rlly go for the 5 stars. the 5 stars are really that better it‚Äôs just depends on the character. Anything else than that there are battle passes now but honeslty seems pretty useless considering I have all the materials i need already. OVERALL SUCHH AN AMAZING GAME. so addicting i haven‚Äôt been able to stop.",5
"Amazing game, with hours of content, dynamic characters, great story, beautiful music, and an engaging story. Adding keyboard & mouse support to iOS & iPadOS would be huge quality of life improvement for some of us who are not always able to get behind a PC for longer gaming sessions. The touch controls are fine, just limited in terms of the level of control you have. You only have so much space to pan the camera with one finger, press the buttons with the other, and manipulate the virtual joystick with another. The controller setup works well also, but keyboard and mouse would be amazing.",5
"As someone who prefers not to spend money on free to play games this was a blessing! You can easily progress with spending anything, the graphics and story is amazing. I have nothing bad to say at all if you‚Äôre looking for a game you don‚Äôt have to spend lots of time on or a game you can constantly play and not get bored this is perfect. Thanks to events and daily activities ( commissions) along with all the quests it takes awhile to get bored. Now there is also TCG. It‚Äôs won‚Äôt make a difference in main game activities but offers something different! I don‚Äôt think I have ever or will find a better game.",5
"So here is a story before I get to the point l was playing genshin impact and so I saw that my friend was online and we had a little chat for a bit a nice chat but I decided sense my friend wasn't responded for a while I thought that they were just busy with a quest or something so I decided to do a quest to while I was doing that quest I whent to see if my friend has responded recently so when I went to check they weren't in my chat box and that didn't feel right because I already added them to my chat box so I whent to check my friends list and they were just gone and I don't know ther UID,  could we get a update where we can friend players by typing ther Nick name please I  wanna see my friend on genshin again ü•∫",3
"To start off, even before I started playing this game it looked really appealing. One things for sure when you start playing this game the visuals are already so beautiful. My favorite part is the characters and making them stronger. Even when I‚Äôm not in the mood to play it, I think ‚ÄúI need Arataki Itto‚Äù, which keeps me going.

The storyline also makes me want to keep on playing, because I want to know what‚Äôs going to happen next. I want to know how the other places like Fontaine will be like.

Sumeru was just released and it‚Äôs beautiful. However, I do wish the new characters were more darker-skinned, considering Sumeru is based off of South Asia. I hate the fact the new archon looks like a kid, but is like tons of years old, but I won‚Äôt complain.

Even though the wishing system can be frustrating at times, obtaining new characters is really fun. Especially when it‚Äôs the new five star‚Äî or a character you really love. This is really long and I can go on, but I don‚Äôt want it to be like 10 paragraphs so yeah. Bye.",5
"I had put off playing Genshin for a long time because I wasn‚Äôt interested in Gacha games. But the more and more I saw content for all these beautiful characters, the more I wanted to play so I finally downloaded it and fell in love. The music, design, graphic, and main storyline are all so well done and makes it so addictive. It can be a little overwhelming at first, especially getting and building characters. My biggest gripe with the game is the amount of grind it takes to level characters, especially in late game and the overall diversity. I wish we had more variety of skin tones and body types in the characters",5
This game is absolutely phenomenal this game is phenomenal first of the factors when you see on like a page or when your sibling tells you someone is getting a rerun it feels like there‚Äôs a firework going off in your body you‚Äôre just so happy although I am sad that Chloe is gone I am all right about it because so many other amazingly good five stars are here and four stars are also phenomenal personally I really want the children no not child I want Diona Klee Qiqi and suyu and I love how they‚Äôre all powerful and they‚Äôre all unique I‚Äôll say it again this game is phenomenal and amazing and just light me up and I know that this is love,5
Once you get in the game where it has amazing intro and you get to pick a twin and name yourself and then one of my favorite characters you could to meet Kaya and Lisa you also get to meet a bunch of other characters and I love them all the thing that I don‚Äôt really like about the game is the loading part when you first begin to play it takes forever to load but other than that this is probably the best game I‚Äôve ever played it‚Äôs amazing the detail is just off the chain the characters are just so cool love the elements (Kaya is so hot) and everything it‚Äôs a amazing game I recommend people should play it more‚ò∫Ô∏è,5
"The game is just amazing, the only problem that I have is that when you want to buy genesis crystals you have to buy them on the device you made the account on. I made my account on my phone last year. When I got my own computer, I would play Genshin Impact on my computer. I tried buying genesis crystals on my computer but it said that I have to buy them on the device the account was made on. So, I tried downloading it on my phone, but it took up way too much space. I have 32 GB on my phone and Genshin took up way more space than that. Now I can‚Äôt use the money I got for Christmas to spend on this game!",5
The game has helped me through a lot and I spent quite a bit only for genshin to maybe ban my account and give me NEGATIVE PRIMOGEMS. What‚Äôs the point in playing anymore if their just gonna steal peoples money. Something happened on the Riden Shogun‚Äôs banner that genshin have never said. Not once has anything been announced about this issue then just bans players? Mihoyo if there‚Äôs a better way to fix this please say something. Cause while I was trying to save for the new up and rising Limited 5 star genshin takes all those primogems back. For what reason and why is it ever okay to take players primogems. I don‚Äôt if this is happening to other players where their getting negative primogems. But I can never support a game that takes my money and gives me nothing im return. Please fix this issue immediately.,2
"This game is absolutely amazing but I kinda am ticked off about how long it takes to download resources, it takes up to a month for me to be able to play which is so frustrating. I‚Äôve only gotten to play the game like 3 times and I‚Äôve have the game since it came out. Its so annoying because i can‚Äôt even play becuase it takes so long to load. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good my wifi is, it will always take forever to load, it‚Äôs been 3 month since I last played the game and I really want to play it. Please try to fix this it would be so very nice to be able to actually play. I‚Äôm giving it 4 stars because of this major problem. Thank you for reading this review.",4
"I‚Äôm one to play games on my phone bc I don‚Äôt have a Xbox or a PlayStation so it‚Äôs hard to find an affordable and a fun game until I found this game. I was weary about it at first but the more I played the more obsessed I became. I‚Äôm not at adventure rank 30 and I‚Äôve only been playing a month or two. This game is for sure worth it and I do feel (like I‚Äôve read in another review) that instead of having food as the main source to heal there should be potions! This game is my favorite, I‚Äôve been suggesting it to my friends bc I need more friends to play with lol I just brag about how awesome the characters are! :) thank you for an awesome game!",5
"The combat, art, stories, and character designs are amazing! If you like open world games or just wanna play BOTW for free and for longer it‚Äôs great. However recent character mechanics need some work, get rid of inconsistencies before characters and their interactions as well as a rework of Kokomi. Additionally I want to see some more replayable and permanent end game content.  Finally I think the community deserves some more appreciation from the company. This game wasn‚Äôt anticipated to be a fraction of the size it is now. Even if it‚Äôs behind a 30 day log in event the community deserves a shot at a free five star even if it‚Äôs just a weapon",5
"Other than that once you become a late game AR 55+ player. you quickly realize how little the game really has the offer for pinnacle rewards. For being able to clear the hardest content in the game once a month, you are rewards with 1200 primo gems. You need 1600 gems to get a full 10 pull on banners. This end game content is called spiral abyss and is the only endgame content in the game that rewards primos. I have been playing since release and for them to have given such a tiny minuscule reward for their one year anniversary it kind of just tells you that they have little to no intention of changing their greed in the future. This gives little incentive to play the game while the rewards are so‚Ä¶ insignificant. I have spent close to a grand on this game and their one year present to players was equivalent to around 40 cents.",1
"i‚Äôm ar56 and have been playing this game frequently since december of 2020, and it‚Äôs a good game, but the devs do not care about the players. they make millions upon millions of dollars from the fan base and for the one year anniversary, they give us one ten pull (which is not a lot by any means) for logging in for a week, aka the same reward we got back at the lantern rite festival. we aren‚Äôt asking for a lot, but they are silencing our voices and ignoring us, instead having us freely promote their game (fanart contest, cosplay contests, etc) for a CHANCE to win 100 primogems, which isn‚Äôt even enough for a single pull. it just doesn‚Äôt make sense. do better, mihoyo.",5
"Genshin Impact is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. I play on mobile and a lot of mobile players say there is bad graphics, takes up too much storage, and they have bad audio quality but personally for me it‚Äôs not that bad- that‚Äôs not the point of my review I just decided to put it there, I love the character designs and the voice acting is amazing. The story and other minor quests *mostly character hangouts lol* are really fun and always keep me entertained no matter how hard it is...overall definitely one of my favorite games I play it everyday and hope to get better the more I play!!",5
"Overall I love this game! It‚Äôs the best! Just wanted to report a tiny bug though, I recently deleted it since it was acting a bit wonky, I did reinstall it and since it was just my Internet I was trying to log back in, but I did seem to forget my password. I did try to change it, but every time I do it says ‚Äòmissing parameters‚Äô and everyone is saying that the creators haven‚Äôt came out with an official way to fix it, I was wondering if I could get that here since I really don‚Äôt feel like starting my progress all over again. Like I said I love the game though! Just a small thing I need to fix.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a few months now and i have done nothing but love it, this game is stunning and supper fun >:D 
The only thing i really wanted to say was that the game takes up about 8GB after downloading the full version. I would also not recommending playing this game on any iPhone older then the iPhone 7, though with the iPhone 7 you have to use the lowest graphics settings. if you really want to enjoy this game to its full potential i suggest having an iPhone Xs (Xr included) or higher, though this is just a guess. anyway i hope this was helpful and i hope you enjoy the game as much as i have!!",5
"I love genshin impact i love the graphics, the story, the characters and many more stuff but the problem is that when i play on my ipad it just kicks me out but with my phone its fine so can you please fix that. Another con i have is why is there no Nintendo switch version of this,many switch users want a genshin impact switch version, those are all my cons. My pros are that the graphics are very good for a mobile game it looks very clean when i play. Another pro I have are the characters voices very good for english and Japanese  love them both. The game is ver addicting I play like 6-7 hours a day. Anyways love this game very much.",5
"I am very obsessed with this beautiful anime game. I have been collecting the super rare 4+ genshin‚Äôs characters in my display playable characters. Couple days later, they hacked my account and stolen my favorite ultra-rare characters also legendary weapons as well. I learned that they does not cares about people‚Äôs feedback. MiHoyo Company just want your moneys. MiHoyo decide to dump on this large game with full junks space, letting hackers getting into vulnerable game because of lack security update. 

Thank you for ruined my life. I wasted my money, time, and life on this. And... you copied from the breath of wild Zelda and paste it in this as everything look exactly same from Zelda‚Äôs similar ability. That...does against COPYRIGHT law of Nintendo BOTW.

Otaku save the genshin impact world? That sounds ridiculous. Too many females and just few male. A lack of male characters and they being discriminated. ATTENTION MIHoyo‚Äôs fans: Keep in those mind, Most female in this game, a few male characters were there. 

However, It would be nice if they add Zelda female playable in BOTW. 

I not very pleased with it, I don‚Äôt think i ever play this. Guys, don‚Äôt waste your money and life and time on this. They all is do only want your money and doesn‚Äôt listen to people!!! I would not recommend, give zero rate.",1
I had realized that I haven‚Äôt played Genshin in a long to so I decided to log on and play for a little instead of the starting screen I was at the log in screen it said ‚Äúyour account has expired please enter your password‚Äù I didn‚Äôt remember my password because I didn‚Äôt know my account could expire and I didn‚Äôt take a screenshot of my user so there goes that I have my UID Though I was told my someone that if you don‚Äôt play a lot and you have five stars you‚Äôll probably get your account deleted or something because mihoyo might think your going to sell it...I would never sell my account I was excited about my first five star i would like help please.,5
Literally this game is so good. Like the tiny little details and to the beautiful graft s and lighting the voice acting is fantastic and the characters are top tier. And it‚Äôs completely free! I never loved and RPG game my entire life. It doesn‚Äôt show ads at all and it never tells you to pay for anything. The only problem I have is the fact that too obsessed I can‚Äôt stop playing! Also I love how fun it is to play without spending no money at all. And it still gives you the freedom and quality of an top tier RPG game. This game it literally the best in my opinion and can highly recommend it to some of you. Overall an amazing game.,5
"The game is beautiful. I loved exploring the world and experiencing the story. I would totally recommend everyone try out the game for a bit. 

But, the rates killed the game for me. I completed the entire story and was level 31, when I pulled my first 5 star. I got a legendary bow. Putting in several hours a day to grind the game for almost to weeks just to pull a bow in my pity was a real let down for me. I continued playing and grinding through the event, but I‚Äôve just hit level 40 and haven‚Äôt pulled any other 5 stars. With how difficult it is to get enough resources for one or two pulls, just to get some useless weapon that I have 5 dupes of really put me off the game. So be warned, you could very easily be let down by the gatcha system in this game.",4
"The game is so beautiful and by far the prettiest mobile game ever. The world is so interesting and calming. The voice acting is amazing and engaging, the sound effects make it even better. Even simple things like the opening menu is pretty to look at. So far, I haven‚Äôt glitched or had major lag. My only complaint is sometimes it gets a little~ too hard for a beginner player like me. I also think leveling up in general should be easier, both adventure and character levels. But even that is a nit-pick. Overall, it‚Äôs great and I recommend it. It will be hard to find something better than this.",5
"This game is amazing. One of the best open world games I have ever played. The graphics are amazing and the controls are very easy. The only reason I‚Äôm giving this a 4 star is because of the primogems, the world quests, and the summons. For the primogems all I ask is that you make them more easily obtainable. I could be grinding for hours and I would only have a few hundred primogems. Second the world quests. The world quests are really frustrating. Most of the time they aren‚Äôt specific enough so the quests are even harder to do. Then with the summons. This is the most frustrating part of the game for me. I‚Äôve summoned like 100+ time already and I only got 1 5 star. I understand the 5 stars are supposed to be rare but it‚Äôs just not fair.",4
"My phone just updated to iOS 14 and I‚Äôm super salty with how frequently the game keeps crashing. I can‚Äôt even open the game- all I see is a black and white screen. I was really enjoying this game but the frequent crashes has gotten me extremely upset, especially considering how apple doesn‚Äôt let you downgrade from iOS 14 to 13. I‚Äôm also incredibly disappointed by the fact that it‚Äôs not capable with an iPhone 7 Plus. I guess I‚Äôll no longer have the chance to play this game. Sigh. I seriously cannot express how disappointed I am. I was having a great time, but now, it seems that I won‚Äôt be able to continue playing. üòîüòï",4
"I love playing this game on my phone, the graphics are absolutely beautiful, the game is just the right amount of difficulty to where it‚Äôs challenging, but not so much that I get fed up with not being able to defeat stronger enemies. My only request, is that adding controller support would be amazing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the mobile controls are awesome, they‚Äôre not clunky, or hard to use. But adding controller support will be a game changer. One last thing: this isn‚Äôt tied towards the mobile version, but the PS4 version is awesome too, but I feel like the FPS is a little slow. Anyway, this game is absolutely beautiful and I will be playing it for a long, long time. Thank you!",5
"This game is completely broken on ipad to the point where I don‚Äôt understand why its even compatible with it. The opening cutscene was so laggy it was going at about 3 frames per minute and the audio was constantly glitching out. Then when I could actually move around, the environment is completely black until I actually walk on it and then the grass and rocks fill in, but theres zero draw distance, and i cant see the sky at all. At first I thought that was some weird part of the tutorial but nope, even after that it still is completely black. If I went off into the black my character just becomes a giant ball of white light for some reason and the environment that was loaded would glitch out. I tried updating the ios on my ipad thinking that could be causing the problem but nope. Still no draw distance and now the app takes a full 3 mins to open. COMPLETELY BROKEN.",1
"first of all, this game is AMAZING!! it‚Äôs beautiful, with a huge map to explore and awesome gameplay and mechanics. 11/10 in that regard! however, it closes on me constantly. there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a trigger, and the time in between crashes can vary from 15 minutes to under 1. fortunately it saves often so i don‚Äôt lose much progress, but some battles (the mini boss ones, not sure what they‚Äôre called) are nigh impossible because i can‚Äôt finish them fast enough to avoid a crash. i always come back to the monsters at full health again and my characters still having taken damage, all for nothing (ps i‚Äôm on a 6th generation ipad, turned down the graphics and freed up more storage but no luck). hope this gets fixed soon, otherwise game is absolutely fantastic!",3
"This game is fantastic, but there‚Äôs two huge issues that I have with it. The first is that it crashes or becomes unresponsive (requiring a full restart) every 8-12 minutes. This is extremely frustrating. The second is how unforgiving the gacha system is in the game; I.E. the combat is balanced so that if you‚Äôre not paying a lot of money, you‚Äôll always feel behind and underpowered.

That being said, I love the exploration aspect of the game, and the combat is fun and interesting. The character progression could use some work, and the story could use better writers. But the voice acting (where present) is really good.

My final verdict is don‚Äôt play it here on your mobile device. Get it on a platform they care about, like PC or Xbox or (when they release it) on Switch. The crashes here are nearly unbearable, and it very much ruins the experience.",2
"Let‚Äôs start with the good things about this game. The graphics are neat, it‚Äôs a beautiful map with lots do explore and do.
                    The reason I‚Äôm doing a 4-star review because I think primogems should be at least 100. It‚Äôs not very fun and easy to obtain them if you‚Äôre ar60. 

I also think you could try harder with the events that come out, and lastly but definitely not least, diversity. I think their needs to be black people, there‚Äôs over 40 characters, and only two characters (Keaya and Xinyan) that have a light tan. The Sumerian is a disappointment I was hoping for diverse characters.
The game is addicting, but come on, think outside the box, think diversity and, creativity.",4
"I downloaded this game on my phone once before deleting it. I played it awhile beforehand though, and from what I saw the graphics and audio were incredible. I was getting very invested in the story when I decided to download the game on my iPad. Even with my iPad being completely updated, I was experiencing horrible issues with glitching audio and a black screen encompassing most of the beautiful imagery. I checked online and MANY other people are having the same issues. The game also has trouble loading and it took FOREVER to download so I‚Äôve been pretty disappointed. I‚Äôm hoping these bugs will be patched soon considering me and many others were very excited to play this game and were let down. Please consider this before you download.",3
"As a person who is not new to GACHA games, the resin (aka energy) system in this game is horrible. This game wants to be an open world MMO, and for the first 20 ranks feels exactly like it. Once you finish the story content though get ready for a serious drop in things to complete thanks to the lack of content and resin system. End game type items are dropped by bosses and domains but the only way to actually get the drops is to have enough resin to ‚Äúreceive drops‚Äù, if you don‚Äôt- you can waste time fighting them and will receive nothing as a result.

Not only that but unlike other GACHA games, your resin doesn‚Äôt increase with rank ups, so you‚Äôre severely limited to how many battles you can actually do. The only 2 ways to replenish this are with items that are sparsely given out (which don‚Äôt even fully replenish resin) or canibalize primo gems (used for summons for characters) which means you can‚Äôt summon as many times to try and get hero‚Äôs you want. Another thing tied to the resin system: experience books to level up your heroes. What does that mean? 

You either have to spend money to play the game, or sit by idle and spend 20 minutes a day on the game and then log off while you wait for resin to replenish. 

This game will get a 1 star for as long as paying to actually play is required.",1
"The controls feel fluid, the story is engaging and well written, the open world is truly open and the map is huge and gives a real sense of adventure. This game is unlike anything I'v played on mobile before and I'v had more fun with this than any AAA game I'v played in awhile. I know that this review is constant praise but it is genuinely impressive and FREE. Not since Warframe has there been such a well made free to play game that doesnt feel restricted by paywall. I don't feel like i need to pay a cent for the game, but i will anyways because i support this kind of care and love from a development team, and i feel as though I'm easily getting my moneys worth from the money spent.",5
"I‚Äôd say this game is the best game that has came out since the App Store even was a thing. This game has progression, open world, puzzles, and many more stuff that makes you want to get more of the content. The story is actually good, which makes you want to not miss it and pay attention to what‚Äôs going on. The character progression is iffy, but you can deal with it. It has minimal grinding, but fun grinding. Killing monsters in this game is satisfying since you get to combo your units together, or just test out your new unit with sick artifacts. Overall if you don‚Äôt mind your iPhone being turned into a frying pan, give this a try and it‚Äôll make your mind explode from how good the game actually is.",5
"This game. My god. It has taken over my life ever since I played it at PAX. Since then I have been watching it closely, and from the convention, to the beta, to now, my opinion hasn‚Äôt changed. I adore this game. The graphics are beautiful, the open world is gargantuan and it gets even bigger as you go, the mechanics are so much fun to get used to, and I‚Äôm honestly blown away how this game is free on top of all of that. There are micro transactions - like any other free game - but they are 100% not required in order to progress or be good at the game. All of this and more makes it incredible, and if I sung all its praises, we‚Äôd be here all day. I can‚Äôt wait to jump back in for real. Thank you, Mihoyo! üíï",5
"Genshin impact is an amazing game with OST which make you sleep like a baby, hot character witch make you give in on your gambling addiction and landscape which are so pretty your whole phone might crash unless you play it on low quality. But you have to bear in mind Genshin impact is a long game and its getting longer. If you joined the Genshin community in 2020 or 2021 you would love this game due to there only being two regions and on sibling quest. But now there are 4 regions, 2 sibling quests and a bunch of side quests to complete to progress to the next level. Which makes this game less new player friendly.",5
"I love this game so much, whenever I‚Äôm bored and have nothing to do, I log on to genshin which loads REALLY fast, in no time I‚Äôm in the game playing working on my characters and If the domains get too hard for me to beat on my own, I invite my friends to co-op which is basically like multiplayer and we have fun DESTROYING these domains. This is one of the best games I ever played and I play lots of games I highly recommend this game because it is fun and addicting, if that‚Äôs the type of games your into genshin is definitely for you I can‚Äôt wait to see new players start playing genshin so I could join their co-ops and help them as much I could",5
"Genshin is a beautiful game, the graphics, the music and characters, all are amazing. I find myself entertained for hours, when playing with friends we lose track of time. This has to be one of my favorite games. 
My only issues are that whenever I‚Äôm playing co-op or teleporting or mid cut scene, my game crashes. Sometimes it won‚Äôt load me back into the game, it takes awhile and that isn‚Äôt fun. A few times it‚Äôs crashed mid boss fight and I have to start all over. But other than that, the game is amazing and a lot of fun, it‚Äôs cool figuring out builds for characters and fighting bosses and playing with friends.",5
"This is overall an amazing game and definitely one that I would suggest to many people however there were few miner details I found could use a slight change. One of these details is the diversity, I found that most of the characters are white and all the children characters that are currently playable are all female. Of course these are just minor details this game is one of my favorite games and I highly suggest trying it out to anyone who may be reading my review to get an idea of the gameplay. I really love the storylines and the scenery is absolutely outstanding, have a nice day and thank you for reading this.",5
"I love genshin impact, it‚Äôs been there for me to play as a comfort game whenever i‚Äôm down or am bored. The game is something i‚Äôve been playing for over a year, I love this game but something‚Äôs need to be brought up. I wish that the characters would have a bit more POC presentation, like most sumerian NPC‚Äôs are very light skinned, we don‚Äôt have many black or blasian characters. I wish that a lot more communities would get the representation they deserve, maybe Beidou should have tan or slightly sunburnt skin since she‚Äôs out on her boat a lot. Things similar to this or ways that F2P players can get 5* without having to spend so much money.",5
"Everything about this game in breathtaking, it had me hooked from the demo alone! From the characters, gameplay, storyline graphics, and the attention to detail, this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. And the fact that it‚Äôs free amazes me. The only problem is, I can‚Äôt play it. I can‚Äôt tell you how devastating that was, even after I deleted 18GB worth of space it still said insufficient storage. The online hacks didn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve tried getting this game twice already with the same problem both times. It‚Äôs a shame because it really is a wonderful app. I hope this can be fixed!",5
"My daughter made a mistake and purchased 2 thousand dollars worth of in app purchases because my card was still saved to the game I understand my part of not erasing my card info but I didn‚Äôt think this would happen‚Ä¶ almost a year later of having the run around they tell me they can not do anything after 2 months but I have been calling‚Ä¶.i am a single mother and disabled and I have to take this as a lost while there pockets get fatter.. I write this with a heavy heart and now looking to see if I can take legal action for this, also I want all parents to make sure if u do make a purchase you erase all info afterwards because this happens to many times to good people just trying to make it to the next day‚Ä¶",3
"Wow! Honestly I love the characters from Genshin impact! Battling the monsters is very challenging, and I like that! Paimon is very adorable and kawaii lol. I like that in the beginning you choose your twin from the gender and then you try to find your brother/sister, Genshin impact is very different than all the other games, this game is so amazing! Like omg I love it! It‚Äôs so entertaining ! My most favorite characters are either fischl or noelle. Amber was my favorite character from the beginning üòÇ. Another thing is that I like how the statue of seven heals you. If the statue of seven wasn‚Äôt in that game how would we survive!? Amazing game! I give this game a 5 star. üíñüíñ loving this game! Amazing job üëçüèª‚ú®!",5
Hi this game is wonderful but I‚Äôve experienced some bugs and glitches. I was just wondering if you could fix that. Me and my friends have played this but all of us had bugs or glitches. I was thinking if you all could fix that. I can and will give you all 5 stars. Just because it worked for some of my friends and they said that it was amazing. I experience that on lucy‚Äôs phone shes my childhood friend and i still know her since 2 years lately. So all of my friends told me to send you all feedback because i knew you guys deserved it. Although its an amazing game that you all made. Bye and love you all :),5
this game is fun!!! honestly i get really frustrated at times because i‚Äôm to dumb to solve the puzzles in this game but completing the challenges feel good. I do find some of the quest boring but i really like all the quest with my favorite characters they make me really happy ^^. I have never played a game this fun. I also really enjoy getting to know your characters and wishing. I don‚Äôt do much damage so it‚Äôs sometimes hard. I remember when i got my Xiao to hit decent dmg and was really excited and proud of it. Anyways this game is pretty fun and I would recommend it to people. i‚Äôm giving it a four star only because I didn‚Äôt get Venti smh.,5
"You will want to spend money. You don‚Äôt need to of course, I know so many F2P players who fully enjoy this game and have cleared spiral abyss (the hardest thing in the game). But you will want to. To get all of the characters you will have to spend money, but you don‚Äôt need all of the characters.

With the money warning out of the way, this game is amazing. To me, it‚Äôs worth spending some money on it since I spend so much time playing the game. The most fun combat system I‚Äôve ever experienced, beautiful exploration, a vast story, and the characters are so well rounded. Honestly no complaints, you get out of it what you put into it.",5
"Okay, this game is AMAZING, but there‚Äôs a glitch: whenever I try to load into it, the app crashes. I have researched, and apparently the only way to fix this is by force-resetting my iPad, deleting Genshin Impact, and performing a factory reset. However, I cannot do this, because it would make me lose ALL my data, as far as I know. And not just from Genshin Impact; also from everything else I have on my iPad. If the developers know any other way to fix this glitch, PLEASE HELP! The characters I really want to add to my party are here for a limited time, and if this game keeps crashing I won‚Äôt be able to get them!",5
"Mihoyos previous game Honkai Impact is nowhere near the scope of this one, respectively. Genshin contains a vast, beautiful open world with plenty of puzzles, secrets and treasure, packed neatly in a gorgeous triple A-like polished ribbon. 
However, 
it is a gacha game, like Honkai impact. You must farm currency to get characters. This is not inherently a bad thing, but.. when the characters are not fully polished, and when there is no roadmap to know what's coming next, so you save aimlessly, not knowing if you'll even want the next character, or the one after..
topped with anniversary rewards comparable to one singular piece of meat while an entire chicken is dangled in front of you.. and it becomes draining. Mihoyo has made over one billion dollars, marked in March 2021, the game come out in October 2020.
And they give us... 100 ""primogems"". 100 primogems is not even ONE pull. It takes a max of 90 to get a 5 star character or weapon.

Sometimes a character we may not even want.
I love this game, its gorgeous, the story has SO MUCH potential, please, flesh out your characters, show us their good and bad sides, and please, understand this game is nothing without the playerbase.",3
"Everything is amazing about this game, I have been playing for months now but the game keeps crashing and yes I know a lot of mobile people are having this problem but ever since the new update I can‚Äôt even stay 3 seconds on the game before it crashes and I really want to play this game but I just can‚Äôt, I think it‚Äôs because the world is too big, I think maybe you can separate each part in it‚Äôs own section like the golden archipelago, When I go into the golden archipelago, The crashing seems to have stopped but in teyvat is where it happens. Please try and find a way to fix this, Thank you",5
"The game is really fun and I really like it a lot, but the reason I gave it four stars is because whenever I try to watch a cutscene it gets very laggy and even the audio glitches out. I play on iPhone 7plus, but, my friend has none of these problems and she plays on iPhone 6S, that‚Äôs not all I get disconnected every now and then and I had to create a new account because it wouldn‚Äôt let me long into mine. And lastly was one of my worse encounters, I got the bundle of 300 genesis crystals and 90 daily primogems but I ran out of primogems and accidentally wished so I tried to go back but it kicked me out of the game, when I joined back I had 175-ish genesis crystals and a wish I never got",4
"I love the game, the graphics, the storyline, everything.  The issue is I keep getting kicked out the game and can‚Äôt delete the accounts I don‚Äôt need anymore. When I searched online, it told me to directly email the developers and give a reason to delete the account.  I feel like you should not have to disrupt the developers just to delete an account or have to provide a reason to have it deleted.  I wanted to stream the game, but I could not restart and get the introduction scene due to the limitation.  I do not want to have to keep making new accounts to get the intro or disturb any of the hard workers for the game.  Besides those issue, the game is perfect and fun.  10/10",4
"Wow I‚Äôve played fortnite , Roblox , and many more but for some reason this is the most addicting game I‚Äôve played EVER I do have I have no issues with this and it‚Äôs so good. When I first saw it I was like ‚Äú this looks weird but fun and EVERYONES IN MY SCHOOLS TALKING ABOUT IT ‚Äú so I downloaded it and I couldn‚Äôt stop playing after I got kaeya I started playing even more and got noelle I haven‚Äôt played for a long time probably 2-3 months so I‚Äôm bit of a noob but I still enjoy this game and I feel like if I hadn‚Äôt downloaded this I would‚Äôve been missing out in life so whoever reads this and hasn‚Äôt downloaded the game please try it out I promise you , you‚Äôll be satisfied :)",5
So basically this app is amazing and I love it! But there‚Äôs 2 issues! That‚Äôs maybe you could fix? So basically my friend plays on Samsung he found a way to download the app on there! But it keeps on saying he doesn‚Äôt have enough storage space but! He has cleared so much space! And it still won‚Äôt work!! And he tried ignoring it but it would load him into the game! So if you could please fix that! It would be awesome! But when the app downloads no matter what device your on! It takes so long to install! I know it isn‚Äôt recommended for mobile but if you could find a way to fix that it would be great! Other then that I love this game so much!,4
"I love this game BUT I literally hate the mission called ‚Äúin the mountains‚Äù I‚Äôm that ü§è close deleting this game because of this mission. First of all, it literally annoys me so bad that I‚Äôm always getting cold when i‚Äôm going to a snow area and plus i have to fight with monsters and seeing if i‚Äôm getting cold or not?? You workers really thought that i can fight with monsters higher level than me and plus keeping myself warm while fighting with monsters?? I saw a lot of people struggling with this mission called ‚ÄúIn the mountains.‚Äù Please delete this mission. It is too hard for players to finish this mission, but i‚Äôll be honest, the game, stories and everything about this game is perfect and good, except the mission ‚ÄúIn the mountains.‚Äùüòêüòêüòê",3
See I got this game on a sponsor and there are characters but Klee is the one that I really want but she‚Äôs not in the Genshin inpack (sorry I spelled that wrong) and the reason why I want her it‚Äôs because she is soooooooooooooooooooo cute and her voice bruh it‚Äôs so adorable ü•∞ but I can‚Äôt get her I found out on the wed that I can‚Äôt sadly but I do like amber for some reason but yeah I really want Klee but the game it‚Äôs worth it and I really like it it‚Äôs sometimes way too easy but it‚Äôs a cool game I like it but yeah it‚Äôs not just klee it‚Äôs Qiqi to and I forgot her name but she‚Äôs a cat sorry üòÑ but yeah that‚Äôs that‚Äôs all but after all it‚Äôs a good game so yeah that‚Äôs all I have to say sorry if it‚Äôs to long but yeah bye and enjoy the rest of your day bye.,4
It‚Äôs an OK game just when you try to rank up between ranks 25 and 26 and I request that you get to progress through 26 which you have to do a quest for before you even head adventure rink 26 is a tad bit too hard to complete you got two mobs at the beginning charging towards you one mob charging towards you in the middle and you have a lightning cube boss that‚Äôs a tad bit too hard for the amount of time given but it does have great graphics great gameplay and great story the only thing I would change is the adventure rank limit breaks. Because of that Lemic adventure rank test I have lost two phones out of frustration,5
"It a very fun game with many game  mechanics and team set up, that make every characters can be useful. The graphics is beautiful and nice vast world. 

Two things that would be nice for the developers of the game to do is being able to sync a mobile account with a PlayStation account. Only use one account of those two consoles. Also, make the mobile version of the game be use with a mobile controller. It‚Äôs very easy to play the game with a controller then touching the screen, and this game can be played with a controller because of the PlayStation version. They can use the same controller settings of the PlayStation and transfer it to the mobile version if a player uses a mobile controller to play the game.",4
"I truest love this game, it is so addicting and I have just started! The graphic quality is so good!! Like you usually don‚Äôt see this kind of graphics anywhere, not even in other games. I just have a slight problem, since I have just started I have this error that occurs when I tap a NPC to speak to or encounter a quest. Whenever I encounter a quest or speak to a NPC my avatar freezes and I Can not do anything anymore, also I can not even tap any buttons it just freezes the screen. The avatar is still moving, but I can not do anything. I do not know if this is due to lag or anything else, but if this is resolvable I would appreciate it! Thank you so much for creating the game :)",5
"THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME!!1!1!1!1!1! Like seriously though, AMAZING LANDSCAPES AND COLORS AND CHARACTERS I-
But there‚Äôs one problem. CRASHING. THIS CRASHES LIKE EVERY 4 MINUTES, I WAS FIGHTING A RUIN GUARD AND IT WAS LIKE LEVEL 35 SOMETHING (yes, I am a noob) but then it crashed- I was so mad because I had to restart and I already defeated like half of the ruin guard‚Äôs health, and I have the worse characters ever. Then the cycle repeated. It kept crashing although I cleared my tabs, shut down my iPad restarted it like a thousand times, but nothing seemed to work! Also, when there are automatic scenes like when I first started the game Lumine and Aether was fighting the God, but it froze the entire time, I only got to see a screen of the God and Lumine like what??? Basically this whole review in other words is saying lagging, crashing, and quality rate is not the best. Please fix.",3
"I‚Äôll give you guys 5 starts because it‚Äôs seems like a lot of people are enjoying this game, and also because you guys tried hard to make this game, it reminds me of breath if the wild it‚Äôs so beautiful and has the little tinkers that remind of the Zelda game. üôÇ
Anyways, I when I go into the game it loads and has had, and then when it goes to the story and i hear a little voice cut out and then kicks me out, it‚Äôs really disappointing, and hopefully it‚Äôll work later on, it‚Äôs a big game so that‚Äôs why it can‚Äôt work in the old iPad. Anyways I hope you guys keep doing what you‚Äôre doing to work hard! Keep it up!üëãüèæ
P.S.: sorry for the long paragraph üòÇ",5
"Even if it‚Äôs a little bit‚Äùtoo‚Äù similar to botw and they recommend to use a iPhone 8(or something like that) I have been waiting for the game almost around a year and even if I got to play a small amount(cause I have an iPhone 6s and it can‚Äôt barely even render the world around me only a certain space) I will say it was somewhat fun even with the ol‚Äô gacha and microtransactions it‚Äôs a indie group and a game that at least it can pretty much destroy the potato I call a phone and the game on its lowest settings, so I‚Äôm really hyped to see what will the Switch version will be like although I do hope there‚Äôs a way just to play the game by yourself and that the game also expands over to Xbox because it might go well I don‚Äôt really know.",4
"I‚Äôve played it since release and I‚Äôm having run with it. I have a iPhone 6+ so I am a victim of the black screen and flashing white light, however I was able to still play even after the turret section with stormterror, I had to adapt to it and have been playing this way until now. Sadly I have reached a time and place where I can no longer progress, in short, I‚Äôm kinda softlocked. The only thing I can do is run around doing the same bosses and grind shards. And that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm going to do because even though I can‚Äôt progress, I still love this game and will patiently wait until it is optimized for lower end phones. Keep up the good work everyone at miHoYo!",5
"Seriously? I had really high hopes for this game, and I can‚Äôt even get into it. I‚Äôm stuck on a white screen. When I first opened the app it was just that for a I‚Äôm good 5-10 minutes. Then I finally get in and download everything that was like 3 minutes just to find out it was the demo part so then downloaded the full game wait 1h-1h30m just for it to be around 80 something percent just for a blank white screen. Idk if this is a glitch for the mobile game but before you even begin to think about updating this you should get this sorted out.

Edit: I‚Äôll try to play the desktop version, but Jesus Christ. I left a 2 star instead of a 1 because I wanted to give it a chance, I did and it just crashes. I learned there‚Äôs a recommended iPhone... you seriously except people to go out of there way to pay big bucks for a free game? I understand I‚Äôm slightly being a choosing beggar but goodness!",1
"Honestly it‚Äôs been a long time since I liked a game this much to the point I‚Äôve already sinked more hours than I can count into it. That said however I do hope that there will be more work on the co-op as I find me and my friends often see each other running in place, characters will glitch through the ground or into weird forms, and although it‚Äôs cool to fight bosses and domains the limited amount of resin makes it so that you don‚Äôt have much else to do after an hour or so in co-op. Also there it‚Äôs be cool if there was a slight difficulty increase in the world while in co-op as right now co-op hasn‚Äôt at least as far I see been much of a challenge out of the wolf boss.",5
"I saw this game when I was scrolling through the App Store, and was really excited, there are so many good reviews! And I would be writing a good review here, too, but the game isn‚Äôt working for me :(. The dialogue is very choppy and I‚Äôm stuck on the frame with the crap on the beach, I can hardly hear things happening. This was very disappointing. I‚Äôm not mad, but I‚Äôm not happy either. It might have something to do with me using an iPad mini, but the AppStore said it was compatible, so it‚Äôs very sad that it won‚Äôt work for me. This is not a review to discourage everybody to not get this game, it‚Äôs just me expressing my sadness. Have everybody else is having a better experience!",5
"I played for 2 days and I CAN NOT SEE LIKE 6 FEET IN FROUNT OF ME! I started playing and I can see the sky in the seen the first ones was good but when the like 4 or 3 ones came it was bad it froze but there was noise and the noise was stoping and starting over and over again and it was really bad. I saw pictures online of others playing and there‚Äôs was great they could see every thing the sky was blue and had clouds and they could see the ocean and lakes. The way the world looked was the thing I was the most excited about and I was really mad, confused, and sad when I saw what it looked like for me and I saw that some others have bin have this problem too. So can you please fix it so that everyone who played this game can see the Beautiful world in Genshin impacted.",3
"Ok, this game is my addiction literally!! I‚Äôve been playing this game for the past 7 months and it‚Äôs the first thing I do every morning! This is a great game and I love it but I hate this new thing where I need to be connected to the internet. Now the game that I can play on the go is no longer a go game it‚Äôs a stay-at-home game. Not everyone is a pc or console user. Me and most others play mobile (which I recommend) so if you could go back to how things were before because I would like to play this game while waiting for the bus/train or waiting for class to start. 
I still love this game 100% but please go back!!",4
"This is an amazing game that easily rivals netease games in the current mobile market. You can play with friends whether they are on pc or on their PS4 from your phone and the controls are perfect. I‚Äôve already spent hours playing exploring the world and the game is far from tedious. You can discover new food recipes and mysterious locations that will trigger another cutscene and bring you into a completely different scenery. The game also grants players with premium currency so you can roll for new characters throughout the story, but the free story characters are more than enough to enjoy the game and get through the actual game content. Amazing game!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for a while now and just recently tried to redownload it on my phone and was unable to. I‚Äôve also seen several reviews such as mine with no developer response or promise of fixing the bugs in the future or soon. That being the app saying there isn‚Äôt any space when there is more than enough, leaving possible costumers unsatisfied and unable to even try out the game. This shows a lot on how much Hoyoverese cares about their players. I hope you fix this bug so people can enjoy it on their various devices and not have to waste their time writing a review the developers won‚Äôt read, listen to or overall care about; Just to warn others against downloading Genshin on their phone. Do better Hoyoverese.",2
"I think Genshin is a great game, very fun to play, and worth most of your time. I‚Äôm just gonna cut to the chase and get to the pros and cons.
Pros:
-fun to play (for most players)
-very interesting and deep storyline with hundreds of mysteries yet to be solved, mentioned or not mentioned
-collect characters
-talk to people similar to you/make friends
-battle bosses
-be a potato
Cons:
-very whitewashed characters, not very much diversity, but the game is originated in Asia, which whitewashing is VERY common, but it does bother me and other people
-expensive. it is a gacha game (meaning it‚Äôs supposed to make profit) but sometimes things can get out of hand. a single c6 5 star is usually $1200. 
-eventually gets harder, but that‚Äôs how it is. if your more experienced, things will get harder. don‚Äôt know why 1-star reviews are complaining about this
-some people get banned for no reason
-LOADS of storage for mobile players
-lots of people climbing with Lisa (basically just means sexualizing them)

it‚Äôs mid. I like it. I think you should download it but if you have a problem with whitewashing DO NOT get it!",4
Guys I just got collei and keqing! So I did the latest survey because I desperately needed the pirogems and I had got to the last part where you write your own suggestion and I said that it should be easier to get characters because it‚Äôs hard to get all those pirogems and then use them and then it not be enough you know? And for me I always get doubles and so I wrote that and a couple minutes after I wished on the new set of characters and I ended up getting 2 characters. So I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall but before this I thought they didn‚Äôt ever listen to our suggestions but I was proven wrong today!,5
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin for a little over 7 months and It‚Äôs great. The story‚Äôs, the quality,    The characters, the quests, and more. But the one thing it does lack is people of color, sure they have darker skinned people, but they aren‚Äôt even dark skinned. Their tan at best. the new region that‚Äôs coming out, Sumeru should have people whom are darker skinned since it‚Äôs a dessert, and also based off The Middle East. but most characters aren‚Äôt even tan. And if they are it‚Äôs poorly portrayed and some are very orientalist. 
Genshin, and hoyoverse is otherwise is fine as it is. But has many flaws that it must work on. It needs to fix its representation and needs to listen to their fan base.",4
SOOO (I just had to restart my regiew bc I misclicked..) Genshin Impact IS a great game however.. I deleted the game not bc of any glitches or bugs that there areŸ´ but the amount of storage all the updates take bc I really wanna play it again but if I reinstalled it would make me delete ALMOST ALL my games and apps. I would only have like 2 apps/games left bc I dont have that much storage. Its still a amazing game tho and this is not a hate reviewŸ´ Everything in this game is stunning but to specify is mainly the plot/story/quest and how pretty the world and unique the characters and animals there are. The only thing i hate about the game is the amount of storage it takes thats all tho :) (Ty if u ever read this..),4
"I love this game so much but it has a lot of problems. Whenever you try to do daily commissions and try to co op before you collect rewards you will not be able to get them. Also if I co op with someone and then try to talk to an npc I am unable to. 

Another problem I have is that I tried to make a ten pull but I didn‚Äôt have enough gems to. After that it took away all of my gems and wishes. 

I can also not use Genshin codes, the space where I should be able to redeem codes does not even show up for me. I have tried to log out and go back in to see if it would show up but it just hasn‚Äôt.

Currently, in the summertime odyssey I am unable to complete the story because a domain does not work for me. Even though they has already sent out an apology and said they have fixed it I still cannot play it or move on in the story. I would love to be able to play this and do the quest but I cannot.

I love this game a lot. I have even spent money on it, but I think that this game just has a lot of bugs over all. And it also does not help that there isn‚Äôt a place to report them unless you are sent a survey.",3
"I‚Äôm addicted to this game, the design is amazing and every character is so well made but if your on mobile expect a lot of glitching and I mean a lot. Almost every time I go into a battle I glitch out. I can‚Äôt beat half my quests because halfway through fighting the game just quits and I have to start all over again but then it glitches again. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money and food trying to get my way through a quest just to have it glitch and need me to start over so just be careful when playing because it‚Äôs an all too common occurrence. I‚Äôve stopped playing a lot because of my game keeps glitching throughout a quest I don‚Äôt see much point in playing",4
"the game has shown time and time again that they are able to properly and thoroughly research regions where they draw inspiration from. They show a lot of attention to detail and respect, especially to characters like Yun Jin, which was meant to showcase Chinese opera for a global audience. HOYOVERSE even rebranded to reach a global market... and now they want to refuse to listen to global players? Sumeru is looking very concerning with the white npcs. I know they‚Äôre capable of researching. I have no clue why they are choosing to instead lean on orientalist stereotypes. SEA & SWANA cultures deserve just as much care and attention as Chinese, Japanese, and German cultures do. Why get lazy now? This sort of thing is what will cause this game to fizzle out before it reaches the end. Listen to your players. Do proper research and for the love of god give characters some melanin. Two out of the massive cast is pitiful. Do better.",1
"Leaks about the in-game region Sumeru recently went out (as of when I am writing this). I do not understand the anger. I see many fellow players who do not know the odds stacked against these developers (which I will not go into detail regarding) so it is unfair. As a mixed race person myself, I believe we should judge characters for their, well, character, and not what color the pixels are on the screen.

There are, and will be, many darker-skinned characters in this game as with the lighter- skinned. I do not want this very fun and inclusive game to get review-b/mbed by people who do not understand. I love this game to pieces. Thank you for reading.",5
"purchasing things is extremely costly in this game and it‚Äôs hard enough to get primogems in the game without working very hard or buying them. it takes nearly two days to get 3 wishes in this game, and considering the fact that one of the main features in the game is the gacha element, i think making primogems and currency to buy characters should be MUCH easier than it is. since some games with gacha features in it are way way easier to play and get money in, i can‚Äôt help but feel like genshin is just trying to make money off the audience (and it is) but it makes me mad anyway üò°üò°üò°",4
"Genshin is a great game and fun to play! It‚Äôs always exciting to get new characters and try them out. The map is so vast and big, it‚Äôs nice to not get bored of the same scenery. The only thing that I‚Äôd say is that it takes up a lot of space, as well as Honkai Impact, and I have to delete a lot of apps to download this. Otherwise, great characters, map and events. The events are very fun, especially windtrace, if you ever get to play it. Quests in this game are almost endless, daily commissions give rewards. Great game play. I came in the early stages of this game, more and more characters have come out since then (2019 or 2020 forgot)
Have fun!",5
"Honestly after like 5-6month of playing this game I gotta say it gets very exhaustive. At first there‚Äôs a main storyline that you follow but it‚Äôs not finished yet and you gotta follow on with some side quests which are not that intresting. The only thing that makes all the hustle a bit fun is playing with your fav characters, and the process of getting them is soo long & SUPER EXHAUSTING, mainly because there‚Äôs no system that guarantees you will get the ones you want, which after all the hard work makes you feel pretty unrewarded. Unless you‚Äôre willing to pay for the game, this way you could buy wishes and have your fav characters much easily; BUT if you wanna put your time & energy & effort on this game for the sake of being rewarded at the end of the day, (spoiler alert) it is NOT going to happen.",2
"The game is addicting, the best game I‚Äôve played, because the amount of effort put in the game, making it look amazing and fantastic, a lot characters. I personally think this game is fantastic, because of the creativity, in it, and really inspires this being to their culture. The characters have so much potential in them, and amazing character designs. This game truly is really inspiring from Chinese culture, and see how it‚Äôs amazing. Though I would add more, to fixing pings and internet connections, because internet could be high but pings in the game are a red. Though, overall the game is SPOT ON. Beautiful graphics and wonderful events.",5
This game is truly beautiful. The art work and music is amazing. The combat is fun and the many different characters keep the game feeling fresh and different. The map is huge and there‚Äôs a lot to explore. The mini games and puzzles are not super hard but some of them still require some thought. Me and my wife are fairly new players just reached rank 25. We‚Äôve both been enjoying it. One thing is that we would really like to play coop more together but we can‚Äôt really do quests or open each other‚Äôs chests which is a bit annoying. Can you please update coop more to accommodate these players.,5
"I have been playing this game since release and my ‚Äúreward‚Äù on the anniversary wasn‚Äôt even enough to do 10 pulls on the gacha. Many players have been experiencing burnout from this game and this is the final nail on the coffin for many people who were hoping the anniversary would bring the spark back. Genshin Impact is very important to me and helped me through quarantine, but I‚Äôm finding it harder and harder to spend hours on a game that hardly rewards its players for their time.

I still want to believe there is more to come and that the anniversary got delayed so I wont give the game 1 star. Please don‚Äôt let us down!",5
"This has been an interesting 3 months. I was told by my friends that this game was great and I joined them in the adventure. They have all quit and I‚Äôm playing alone now.
 The game has been boring. Getting a new character and making a team around them is fun. But the content you use them in is so lame. The enemies are just so drab. The fighting mechanics are not engaging. Their is such insane disparity in the power of characters that makes it just annoying. While the game does have wonderful landscapes and the lore behind them is pretty cool. The characters and the main story is just stupid, overly convoluted and pointless.
The events and ends game are so lame and requires little too no effort.
This game has so much potential but I too, like my friends, will probably be leaving soon. Just just to see something that could of been amazing just fade away because developers get sloppy and rest on their laurels instead of innovating. Shame on them.
If you want a game to play once in a while is fine. If you want a game you can play for hours with something to do‚Ä¶this games is not for you.
P.S. I‚Äôm AR 56 and 36* abyss of people are wondering what my perspective is based on.
Cheers!",2
"I started playing this game in January of 2021, and it‚Äôs been my go-to game for the whole year to this point (sept 2021). It‚Äôs super fun and there‚Äôs always something for me to do or focus on. The exploration part of the game is really enjoyable, and I love how many different things you can do depending on what parts of gameplay you enjoy. I don‚Äôt personally do the spiral abyss, but it‚Äôs there for people who like doing big damage. My favorite think is designing new realms in the serenitea pot housing system! Co op is extremely fun, too, and I‚Äôve made a lot of friends through this game and community. It‚Äôs for sure been one of the best parts of my year.",5
"This game is beyond amazing I got this game an extremely long time ago and re download it a few months back and I fell in love with it again. The graphics, the small details like the berth of the traveler in cold places, and the story line is on another level. One thing I do wish is that it was easier to get primogems and to lvl up, like maybe theirs an area for players of around the same lvl to fight in using lumine or ather and it would be like a tournament and the winner receives like, maybe 600 primogems and like 30 hero‚Äôs wit? But even with that I love this game if your thinking of downloading it I suggest you do it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me sane nowadays üòÖ
Stay safe, and remember your masks!",4
"I love this game so much and play it every day. But, here are some things I dislike. 
1. I don‚Äôt like that the events have to be unlocked by doing a quest. It‚Äôs very annoying for lower level players. I am unable to do the events since I have to do some random quest that unlocks after who knows what adventure rank. I really want to get a seelie but I can‚Äôt compete in the event since I have to do a quest that isn‚Äôt in my quest menu! 
2. Endgame can be pretty boring
Ive heard my friends talking about how there‚Äôs nothing to do in the endgame. I think the higher level players would appreciate some new activities, or quests. 
Thank you for reading! üíó",5
"This game very fun, it hets addicting the more you play and rank up. The character designs are unique, the graphics on mobile are amazing but the device will get hot and lose battery percentage fast depending on you graphic settings. The color scheming are also very beautiful along withe design on the geology. The characters also have their own powers which I thought was very cool and enjoyable. There are many great updates coming while playing. May events are also created along with the updates in the game. I expect many more great updates. Although this was a replica of Legends of Zelda, it is still very exciting to play. Great Job Mihoyo!",5
"I‚Äôve grinded for probably over 100 hours on this game. It‚Äôs unique and enjoyable up until you hit ar 45 to 50+ then you‚Äôll enter the end game where you just have to wait for more content. Even waiting, the game still keeps you interested, which is something I like. I suggest playing this on something other than a iPad or iPhone though. It‚Äôs a big game, a good one though. There‚Äôs so much to do until ar 50, trust me. I‚Äôm at it now and every time I look back I find new events that drag me back in. The game creators are also listening to the community and constantly making it better. Go play it!",5
"It‚Äôs actually quite good, I‚Äôm not too deep into it yet but regardless I‚Äôm enjoying it. It mixes together a pretty solid open world game with a small dose of gatcha. My only issue so far is that my summons have not been very... unique. I got one 5 star character and a bunch of duplicates for two characters I don‚Äôt really care for (I put a fair amount into the game). It wouldn‚Äôt be that big of an issue but I know there are more characters and yet... I only got duplicates for the most part, and only one character per 10x summon. Other than that it looks like an amazing game, I just can‚Äôt give it 5 stars for a gatcha system in this state. Maybe I‚Äôm just unlucky but it‚Äôs affecting my experience a little.",4
"Great game overall amazing graphics, and storyline. There is also much needed improvement on progression throughout the game there is lack of quests and side missions to gain xp the progression is too slow making it overwhelming and hard to progress. It would also be great if there would be other forms of transportation it be amazing if there were other forms to get around faster. Looking forward to everything that you will implement in the future to make this an even better game all you all need is little tweaks to make this the game to go for everyone since everyone gets overwhelmed by the slow progress.",5
"This game is incredibly stunning and beautiful! Each area and character having a special and unique design designed to fit. I would‚Äôve given this game a four star because it‚Äôs incredibly hard to play in mobile sometimes, but the fact that it a completely free game boosts it up a star. I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs a Breath of the Wild copy but it‚Äôs quite different but similar in some ways. However since Genshin is a free game for all its much easier to play! It‚Äôs a game with incredible and unique character designs, stunning and beautiful scenery, and an infuriating gacha system! I recommend that you give it a chance!",5
"So I really adore this game! It brings me a lot of comfort and makes me really happy in general. I mean the design, graphics, characters and more. The only problem I believe is the storage not just on mobile but I‚Äôve tried to play it on pc as well to only be told I didn‚Äôt have enough storage even though I deleted everything on my laptop. It‚Äôs about 17GB on my own phone and especially since I haven‚Äôt been able to purchase any storage it‚Äôs been pretty wild having to delete many things. I just hope this can be brought down but that is all. I really recommend the game though!",4
"Although I had troubles with this game in the beginning, it seems to be running okay for me now (I am running on an IPhone 7Plus) although there is still lag in loading and in most cut scenes and takes longer then normal, I can still play the game without that many problems. I recommend something higher then an IPhone 8 to be able to play this game without problems, but will still be decent on an IPhone 7 (I don‚Äôt recommend going any lower then that) Other then that, it‚Äôs a beautiful game, well story and just simply beautiful for characters and graphics and all that. I can‚Äôt wait to get a newer phone to play this game with ease.",5
"I was recomended this game from a friend and had no idea what i was getting into. I downloaded it and immediatly fell in love with the artstyle. The characters are adorable and well voiced and i get drawn into the story of this vast open world. Just everything from the day and night cycles, changing weather and interesting combat makes everything just work. I hope in the future they will add support for controllers because in combat it can be frustrating when you accidentally are pressing combat moves or use your special attacks when you are just trying to look around. Other than that it is an amazing game and cannot wait to explore more of this facinating world.",5
"Seems like it would be a good game, but whenever I go from having to wait through an ungodly long random white screen that randomly crashes to get into the game, into an hour+ long 6GB download... only to find out the first cutscene for the INTRO OF THE GAME hasn‚Äôt been properly rendered, sound hasn‚Äôt loaded properly fully to the point it hurts to listen to, and then it again... crashes after minutes of painful sounds RANDOMLY... I don‚Äôt see how I could rate this anything other than a 1 star. 

I‚Äôve been following this game for a long time so I‚Äôm very disappointed at the final product not even being a product at all. If the game is fixed to an area where it‚Äôs even LOADABLE from the beginning I‚Äôll come back and give it a shot again.

EDIT 1: Also, make your app support page something other than a link to your download page. Not really helping anyone there devs.",1
"First off I‚Äôve been playing for over a year. It was great at beginning, but soon it took a downhill. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard this a lot but it got slightly more boring. Soon after new content came out (Sumeru) I started playing more frequently again! It is a little harder to earn primos and wishes, but is still worth playing to improve your characters. Would recommend, just not to be full time. It does affect stuff and you can eventually feel the NEED to play. A game is supposed to be something you don when you want to not something you feel forced to. - A happy player :)",5
"This is a great game but about a month ago it was better.
I was at home and I heard of this fun adventure game so I decided to download it and it was a great game! I was playing it every day until i forgot about it. I was playing for like 45 minutes a day for about a good 2 weeks. I was making a lot of progress I thought. Later like 2 days ago from be writing this, all of my data was deleted. I have no clue why my game even restarted. I logged on and saw a sign in screen so, I logged in using my Apple ID and for some reason I got put in the cutscene at the beginning where you pick your gender while fighting the cube lady person. I don‚Äôt know how or why my data even got deleted. All I know is that I would like it back üíÄ",3
"hi, i‚Äôve been playing this game since September 30th, 2020. I love the game, but i have many issues with it. The fandom is very toxic for one, but i know there isn‚Äôt much hoyoverse as a company can do about it. The bigger problems are
1.lack of diversity 
I‚Äôm a white person, and i literally have a darker complexion then all the characters in the game. it‚Äôs actually ridiculous on how much hoyoverse lacks in diversity and listening to the player base. considering that Candace is based if an actual black women(if i remember correctly) and was completely whitewashed. it‚Äôs stupid. so please be better.

2.straying away from the main point of the story 
not as important as the issue above, but y‚Äôall please add some more things involving traveler and sibling. the only thing that has been going on is fetching, and helping people with no information, just ads better plot.

i love the game, i love that it‚Äôs open world, but please create new and interesting characters with more interesting gameplay, and most importantly more diversity in skin tone, specifically darker skin tone. i know that they won‚Äôt see this but, be better",3
"Beautiful graphics, I love the open world concept and I feel the game helps direct you through the story without forcing you down it, or making the world feel too open and hard to navigate. All the character designs are unique and they all come with their own stories that you can play through like quests.

The entire game is just amazing, and besides a few bugs here and there and the grinding you have to do to level your characters, it‚Äôs still a stunning game. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a great story and fun adventure with wonderfully written characters.",5
"A friend recommended this to me so i tried it, and now i‚Äôm hooked. For anyone interested in Genshin, here‚Äôs a personal lists of pros and cons

Pros -
 - Easy to follow along story and navigating really helps with people like me with a bad sense of direction
 - Interesting characters to drag you back into genshin
 - really big open world, like huge
 - unique characters for different playstyles
 - cool features like cooking and fishing, which i personally enjoy

Cons -
 - laggy on mobile, and prone to crashes a lot
 - F2P have a harder time getting primogems
 - personal con, but there‚Äôs no mac support, kinda wish there was as a mac user
 - takes a lot of battery and space, so you have to constantly be around a charger, even if your screen light is at the lowest setting

Overall thoughts: I love it (as stated,) but i wish some fixes were made for mobile. Some of the 1 stars are inaccurate too (complaining about gacha/event,) so take them with a grain of salt. Try it out if you have the battery and storage space!",5
"I love this game been playing it for a long time. The storage is worth it. For all of those 1 star comments about storage it‚Äôs supposed to be a compute game from what I know where you have a lot more storage I will say that I deleted almost everything for it but it didn‚Äôt crash after that and runs smoothly. Anniversary rewards and fine too. Y‚Äôall, they could give you nothing, be grateful. Graphics are stunning and the characters are beautiful. If I have your attention devs. Please consider making cats and dogs be able to be pet. ü•∞ But nothing against the game it‚Äôs awesome highly recommend. Totally addicted üåü",5
"Genshin impact is a great game, there is so much to do and it‚Äôs so fun. The only issue in which they really can‚Äôt control is how much storage it takes up. I have a 32GB amount of storage and genshin takes up all of my storage space despite having very few apps (most of which i can‚Äôt even delete). I HIGHLY suggest that unless you are a very committed player you don‚Äôt get this app. It says it takes up only 3GB but it will end up being 13-14GB it is a world exploration game and it‚Äôs very impressive this even works on mobiles. But please if you have under 60GB and aren't a committed player, don‚Äôt get this.",5
"Genshin is the best, lots of new characters you meet in the story, although, the rewards aren‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs fine! I don‚Äôt understand how some things work though, like pity, I need to read more into it. The lore is good, plus, I‚Äôm loving Keqing and Xianglings friendship! I kinda wish you would bring Xinyan in the new story, she never gets screen time:(. For the anniversary reward(s), I am very glad that it‚Äôs the pink ones(don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called sorry), I hope i get Kokomi soon. I love helping new players, although most of them are Hispanic and I can‚Äôt understand them:(. To sum this review up, I think this game is pretty good, good characters, and great lore.",5
"This game is by far my favorite. There was a small issue with them not listening to the community awhile ago, but they finally took it into account and made up for it. The game‚Äôs graphics and visuals are amazing. The characters are lovable and have wonderful designs. The boss fights are pretty exciting and can be pretty challenging. The stories behind each nation you travel to are so interesting to learn about, and makes you want to learn more and more. I really love the events, especially Windtrace. It was so fun messing around with people in co-op, it was basically like prop hunt. I‚Äôd love to stick around for years to come.",5
"This game is probably my favorite game ever, it has so much to do and has so much replay-ability, you could play it for its characters or it‚Äôs amazing story or for its banger of a soundtrack, people are posting bad reviews on the google play store because they are entitled and I know many more games that would only give out like a banner for their anniversary, MiHoYo is so much more generous, the people that are complaining are entitled and just need to grow up, MiHoYo doesn‚Äôt need all this negative feedback they are doing a great job and I can‚Äôt wait for the next wave of characters to come out! Thank you for the many great memories!",5
"Hey, MIHOYO, this is a great game‚Ä¶ but can you stop ignoring your player base? I‚Äôve been playing for nearly 300 days and have been loving it so far‚Äî the graphics, the MUSIC, the characters‚Ä¶ but burnout has been real for late game players since all we do is go on, do dailies, and get off while spending a little more time on events. 
The anniversary events is what tipped a lot of players off too, not to mention the whole thing with the latest character being scaled weirdly. We‚Äôre not your main focus as China is your main fan base, but I‚Äôm sure even they‚Äôre upset over how stingy you‚Äôre being! Even they were complaining about how poorly the third act of Inazuma was written. 

If anyone is reading this, it‚Äôs a great game and you should definitely install it‚Äî just keep in mind that MIHOYO is a big company, and I‚Äôm just a very salty player :)",1
"You really have 10 million dollars for twitter emojis, but dont have enough to make a namecard? Guaranteed 5 star? Only one. Maybe a weapon to choose from. And you will delete all the negativity from reddit and discord just not to address that you messed up. Didnt even made a congratulations event in game (theater is a web event many regular player prob havent even took part in it). ‚ÄúWell oh you know its only first anniversary and this is a free game‚Ä¶‚Äù yes this is first anniversary, but 40 primos? When you gave 10 wishes only bc you fot nominated for the game of the year in last November‚Ä¶ 

and about the ‚Äúthis is a free game‚Äù thing. It is free, but they earn so much more from making it gatcha rather than making not free but all in game functions were free. If they knew theyd earn more from making it cost money they would do that. Game isnt free bc they care abt you but bc its more efficient‚Ä¶",1
"Mihoyo loves pushing limits with their stinginess and greed. I hopped off this game a few months ago due to the non-stop grind burnout that you have to do to make any progress at all. It was only until today that I heard about the totally sad and lack luster rewards being given out to the players and it‚Äôs honestly really disappointing. For a company that made over 1 billion dollars in a year you really don‚Äôt know how to handle your player base at all. It‚Äôs like you have lightning in bottle in the form of this game and you repeatedly try to demotivated your player base with these out-right stupid decisions. Do better Mihoyo. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game to anybody it‚Äôs just a grinding simulator with 3D models of anime boys and girls that are locked behind a paywall and half baked plot that will take more than 3 years to finish and let‚Äôs be honest, this game will be dead by then.",1
"So as the title of my review says this one bug happens when fighting some bosses. I do know that your team is fixing any bug that happens and that the game is not complete. So do take my comment with a grain of salt. 
The bug that keeps happening is that in the middle of a boss or elite enemy fight the mob that I fight will stop attacking me and go back to its spawn area. Even tho I am right next to the boss.( Also yes I do know that if you get far away from whatever it is that your fighting it will stop trying to attack you. ) and when they/it go back to their spawn they regenerate and then act as if they just noticed that I‚Äôm there and just attack me insanity and then I have to re do the boss or elite enemy fight again.",4
"Been playing since the first Venti banner. Gameplay and characters are great but the company itself is the number one problem with everything. Greedy, stingy, selfish, does not communicate with community at all in times of hysteria, doubles down on problems that needs to be fixed most of the time, and the first anniv. rewards are literally worse than smaller past events that they‚Äôve held such as Latern Rite. The drama that‚Äôs going on right now is more entertaining than the in-game anniversary event. I‚Äôve recently hit AR56 but I regret spending so much money and time into this game. Why should I care about this game anymore if the company and executives doesn‚Äôt care about its player base? Only thing they truly care about is your wallet. I understand it‚Äôs a gacha, but what MHYO needs right now is a strong competitor which will humble their monopolistic model real quick.",1
"This game is so awesome, OMG! I absolutely love it! The graphics are incredible and the amount of characters you can get is astonishing! I just started playing this game today, and so far I‚Äôve been able to collect about 3 - 5 characters! It‚Äôs so fun, you‚Äôre able to cook, battle and do many other things! This game is also a really simple and easy way to past time. You won‚Äôt get bored of it! I most definitely recommend it to everyone! I promise it‚Äôs super interesting! It also reminds me a lot of the Zelda Nintendo Game, so if you‚Äôre a fan of those kind of things, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll really enjoy this game!",5
"This game is amazing with so many things to do at every moment quests,spiral abyss, wishing, fishing, domains and more! But what comes to greatness has a downfall.. I understand the the game needs to take a lot of storage because of how many things programed but we should at the least have a setting to delete the excess quests and extra things we dont need anymore to save space. There is also a problem with black representation I also understand that if thr character is arabian or something they sont have to be black they can also be tan but please try to add more colors of diversity!
Well that is it for my review thank you for reading.",4
"Mounts would help characters get to the location faster. Horses will be the mounts. Give a starter horse and make all horses less expensive, like 2,500 mora. Characters can get horses from Jean. She can give you a FREE horse. Pets can be any animal. SAME PRICE as mounts. You can get a FREE pet. Big monsters that would be under control of the character, would help characters fight mega and big bosses. Characters can get big monsters from Jean also. FREE monster to start. I have had a hard time passing the ruins monster level. Please read this and think about it. It would make GENSHIN IMPACT more and more interesting, and fun.",5
"I was pressured by my peers to play this game and I was super excited! When playing the game I saw the amazing animation and graphics and was super impressed. My cons for this app was the hassle to download it. It takes up a lot of storage on mobile and I had to offload several apps and delete many photos to get it. The app itself has a bit if lag as well. I wasn‚Äôt able to download this version but really enjoyed playing it on my computer. Overall, I would give the game itself a five star, but the system and hassle to download it for me, a two star. If you have ample storage space and are wanting to play this game, I would HIGLY recommend it. It is so addicting to play and I have not been able to put it down.",3
"So i started this game on ps4 and have recently transitioned to mobile and i love everything about the game the only thing i wish it had or they should add just like cod and other mobile apps aswell is being able to connect your ps4 controller to the mobile and be able to play that way, honestly i dont want to be dragging my fingers all over my screen getting it all dirty etc i prefer to keep my screen clean and still be able to play still ‚ù§Ô∏è and ofc obviously because im just used to a controller like many are with a game this complex it will make gliding etc much easier for mobile players i think it will be an amazing thing to add soon !!",5
"I‚Äôm a huge open world fan, and this game did not disappoint at all. I was expecting some kind of ‚Äúpay to progress‚Äù notice to pop up but since that never happened I happily enjoyed this game. The other game creators should really take a page from mihoyos book, because I haven‚Äôt played a game day after day consecutively like this one. Absolutely love how difficult it is to raise your rank, it definitely makes it a bit more challenging and I love how it gets more difficult as you progress, as a game should be. The only downside is, of course, the primogem situation but being that this is a gatcha game, I totally understand. 10/10 would recommend üëåüèª",5
"I'm going to be honest here. I usually hate 
these types of games either they get boring quickly or I'm just not interested. This one though has me completely hooked I love it! It's like breath of the wild but at the same time it isn't which is why I love it. I usually hate playing by myself and having to defeat monsters and going on quests but thanks to this game I have enough confidence on doing all that. I even go for higher leveled bosses! All in all this game is good and I absolutely love it the characters, everything! Definitely a 11/10. It does crash sometimes mainly on my tablet but that's ok.",5
I love this game it‚Äôs great but there are a few problems one being the lack of resin refresh and the second being lack of co-op content I feel like you should have more co-op stuff like domains and even a second spiral abyss type thing where you build a team of 4 and go to see how far you can get and the further you progress the harder it gets and better items you will receive. You could even do multiplayer quest like hidden stuff you have to find and puzzles that take multiple people to complete there are all kinds of things that could improve in this game but those are the few I can think of right off the top of my head,5
"Been looking for a game like this for years. If breath of the Wild was two player this would be it. Mix in some MMO style play, with an excellent combat system. It‚Äôs fun but not too hard. Gets better as you level and understand the game. Didn‚Äôt plan on spending money on it but tbh they have definitely earned it. 

Yo the DEVs: please don‚Äôt stop adding content. Ever. My gf and I will continue to support the game with purchases for years if the content continues to be this good, and continues to be this dense. Some form of competitive play would be nice too. 

Only complaint is the PS4 version doesn‚Äôt use the same account as the phone or pc. I play across all systems. This is my only gripe.",5
"I was happy when I found put that they had a mobile version of this app because I didnt have a laptop/pc or anything like that.

 So I downloaded this game and it took a while, but I didn‚Äôt mind that. After downloading I went straight to the app and the first thing that happened was something about notifications popped up and then it crashed(multiple times).

 I didn‚Äôt think anything of it and decided to delete and redownload. The same thing happened again and this time I found it weird because other rpg games(even ones that takes up a lot of storage space and/or uses a lot of pixels) works fine on my phone. So I deleted and redownloaded again and this happened for about 4 to 5 times till I got tired and just gave up playing it.",3
"This game is simply amazing. It‚Äôs BOTW but anime and has voice acting for the characters. The combat is better than BOTW as instead of backflipping away from and enemy and flurry rushing you can use the enemy‚Äôs strength and turn it into a weakness and use a different ability‚Äôs to give them a weakness. This is not a good description of the combat. Just play it for yourself. There‚Äôs just one problem with the game. Just ONE and it‚Äôs the menus. Every time you try to open one there‚Äôs a chance that your game just crashes. It‚Äôs more common with the character menu than the others so that need to be fixed ,but apart from that get the game and play the hell out of it",5
"I must say it has the aesthetics but when you realize it‚Äôs just another suped up gacha game the illusion fades.

Characters only have two skills so you end up hack and slashing your way through the game which is pretty mindless and boring. You get to switch characters on the fly BUT that‚Äôs provided you get them from the gacha. The rates are trash so you‚Äôll never end up with strong characters unless you spend money. Even then it‚Äôs like 16 dollars per multi roll. You‚Äôre better off buying Breath of the wild. I‚Äôve done 10-15 multis and didn‚Äôt get a single 5 stars while rerolling. So that usually lets me know the game will be more pain the fun in the stand point of a gacha. If you plan on spending like 20-30 I say hard pass. Waste of money since likely you won‚Äôt get much.",3
"Venture for your lost sibling through Tevat that consists of 7 nations and their archons based on real word places, harnessing the 7 elements, geo, electro, Anemo, pyro, hydro, cryo, and dendro. With an incredible Gacha system and tons of characters who can each possess the powers with their visions, genshin impact has one of the most if not the most powerful storyline with audio and graphics that could make you cry. The storyline has made me cry I will say but I‚Äôve never had so much adrenaline playing a game as much as this RPG. I won‚Äôt spoil anything but if I could I could talk about this game all day! Thank you if you made it this far (Paimon is not emergency food!)",5
So I'm stuck with the dendroculous and I really don't want to look up a video and spend hours finding them and ones I've already gotten but! I also know you can get a device that tells you where some are but I have to build up my rep to get it... What I'm not asking is to show people where it exactly is but more of show how many are left in each area.. Like when you go into that area and look at the map it could say how many of them you have left in that area just so people aren't constantly looking for them in areas they've already checked :],5
"I would give this game 5 stars but I sadly cannot. I remember starting this game when Eula just came out. I enjoyed playing the game yet it was kind of confusing, now that I lost that account due to a new iCloud and I had to restart the game I realized, In 2022 now that I‚Äôm such a low AR there‚Äôs nothing for low Ar‚Äôs to do but explore? There‚Äôs no events for us to do to keep us playing the game and having fun, the quests aren‚Äôt really good, there‚Äôs just more dialogue then the quest. In the mountains quest only has 2 dialogue, doesn‚Äôt even tell us what to do. I truly enjoy playing this game it‚Äôs just Hoyoverse needs to add more events for low AR‚Äôs to do. Also, it‚Äôs really hard to get primogems.",4
"I love this game to bits.

I remember playing this game when it first came out and I‚Äôm so glad to see how much has been added to it since then! The characters are my favorite aspect, and the ones I‚Äôve grown attached to just melt my heart to bits.

If there was one small issue for me personally, it‚Äôs that the storage space can be very demanding. Since I only have a 64 GB phone, it takes up about a third of my phone space, which I would love to use for essential apps as well. If there‚Äôs any way that the storage space can be cut would be great! But it‚Äôs understandable given that there‚Äôs so much content in the game. The same goes for when I play on PC unfortunately‚Ä¶",4
"Been playing genshin when it was 2 months old. I gotta say genshin holds a special place in my heart and I am now confident to say that I will continue playing this game forever! The fact that Mihoyo has to constantly update, designing new characters, monsters/bosses, music, design the building/landscape and try making each puzzle different when you are on another nation is insane! The amount of creativity that they put in the game must be exhausting! Since I can‚Äôt fully support them all (F2P‚Ä¶no money) they truly have my gratitude for getting me back into gaming and feeling nostalgia each time I play!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for a while now, honest. And here are my overall thoughts on it! As other games require money to buy the game or to have a console to play on it, Genshin is a 100% free game that has the as much graphics to a game that would‚Äôve been pretty expensive. Also, for those who actually spend money on the game, that‚Äôs entirely your choice. You chose to spend money on the game for another Qiqi, you.

Also is it just me or are the backstories to the characters just so well built and some enough to move me‚Ä¶ How they got their visions just seem really fitting as well.",5
"hello! while playing through the game for the past few months, i‚Äôve noticed repeated errors within the voice lines. to be more specific, i picked the female traveler Lumine. she has some voice lines in main story and side stories where she gets referred to by a different name/pronoun (like she gets called ‚Äúhe‚Äù or it‚Äôs hinting at the traveler was supposed to be Aether). I understand there are many voice lines and other bigger issues than small hiccups such as this but it would be appreciated if we could fix this as to not make new players feel like they were supposed to pick the male traveler vs the female one. Thank you so much if you read this.",4
"Ok so the game is great yeah, 
But there‚Äôs a lot of things wrong with it too
For a guaranteed 5star event banner character that you want you could either get lucky in 10-30 pulls or unlucky where it‚Äôll be 90 pulls which could still lead to a character you didn‚Äôt want. Then you can either grind and hope you don‚Äôt have to hit 90 pulls for a character again OR what this game thrives on, spend money. 

Whales (people who spend lots of cash) do help this game go around sure, they practically fund this game whenever a new/cool 5 star comes out, however if you‚Äôre F2P (free to play) you will have a harder time than they do with getting primo gems for characters. Especially if you hit that point late game where your main income of primos is from daily‚Äôs and events. I‚Äôm considered a dolphin (spent some money but not enough to be considered a whale) and even then it can be a struggle.

Idk if you just wanna chill-ish game and don‚Äôt care about character pulling then you‚Äôll enjoy this, but if you‚Äôre one of those ‚Äúgotta catch ‚Äòem all types‚Äù of players this could be a struggle for you.",4
"Although I very much enjoy the game and its cast of characters it has two major issues. The lack of diversity, and the amount of storage it consumes. Regarding diversity there are many characters with many different backgrounds, but out of all of the cast only two (as of now at least) are tan. And those two characters, being Kaeya and Xinyan, are just 4 stars who hardly show up in the story. Even with their new designs being ‚Äúsupposedly‚Äù based around the middle east they are extremely pale. And while the current regions such as Mondstadt, Liyue, and Inazuma are very much based on real world countries Sumeru seems to be a messy mush. Not to mention it takes an insane amount of storage (half of my phone as of now) to the point soon I will no longer be able to play this game.",2
"I love this this game but every single npc and character being pale with the exception of Kaeya and Xinyan is so weird and frankly getting a bit boring. I know not everyone has darker skin but not everyone has pale skin too, and I think the game experience would be much more better if the characters ingame reflected our world. Not every Japanese, Chinese, and White person is going to be as pale as the Genshin characters and I think the game could benefit from actually having a few tanned characters. Someone that spends all their time outdoors like Beidou and Bennett, for example, probably wouldn‚Äôt be that pale. And with Sumeru on the way, I‚Äôm worried that Hoyoverse will continue this pattern despite the cultures they are using for inspiration. If it happens, I‚Äôll probably quit playing and encourage my friends to do so as well, or at least stop spending on the game.",1
"this game has been a HUGE comfort for me for over a year and a half. to start, this game provides so many great stories, a few fantastic events and unique characters that are easy to get attached to. with this is in mind, im honestly so disappointed in the new region, sumeru. sumeru is based off of south asia, yet they are all pale. genshin lacks so much representation and diversity of characters, even though the regions in the game are based on cultures all around the world. this problem was already there in the first three regions, as kaeya and xinyan are still the only playable characters who aren‚Äôt as pale as paper, and there‚Äôs over 50 playable characters. it‚Äôs honestly so disappointing seeing a game that i‚Äôve made so many fond memories of fail this badly. do better hoyoverse, please",2
"First off, this game is beautiful and there is so much content. 
However, the amount of crashes and lags actually make it impossible for me to play the game. At first, the crashes only happened sometimes, annoying, but not enough to make me wicked unhappy about it. However, they have progressed and increased to the point that my game will crash before I can even get past the sign in screen. This happens every time I open the game, and has been happening for many months. 

Once again, this is an incredible game, but I cannot actually get play it right now and I hope these stability issues get fixed soon.",4
This game is the best first is it takes away my stress after a bad day for me and I get new characters I got two new ones and I am happy to try them out I already leveled them up and it‚Äôs really fun to play the part where I find interesting is that you get to  fight new monsters and new people it may be hard but you get a reward on the way and sometimes  in front of you which I find interesting My dad even said it‚Äôs fun to play and I tried it out it was actually a blast I played and played I even played when I was on a road trip so if your bored and have nothing to play get this game ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂ü´∂,5
The reason why I love this game is because I love how you can level up your character and fight people. It‚Äôs a very addictive game like I can play this all day and I am saving up for raiden or Miko because they are really good characters but anyways the thing is that I wish they could probably make the level a but more smaller to join friends like I get it you have to get stronger and try it yourself but I with it was a smaller level to join like level 9 or 10 instead of level 16 because what If you. Really need help and you want your friend to join like üôÑü§ö. Best friend come and help me and they can help you .,5
"Once you‚Äôve gotten enough of the map explored it can hard to find a lot of primogems. To be able to consistently get new characters, you either need to spend a lot of money, or a lot of time. 

I‚Äôve kinda played on and off for a year now. I‚Äôm AR 51. I‚Äôve been playing for several hours everyday for over a week, and in that time went from like 10 pity to c2 Diluc while trying to get Eula. I understand that there is a chance of this happening. I‚Äôm here to express my frustration with the games gotcha system as a whole. 

Playing for hours everyday and not being able to obtain the limited time character is incredibly frustrating. I think I am going to take a break from the game for awhile.",2
"Genshin is so far the best game I have ever played! I Love the characters, The story, The characters. But their are a few things I would change. The first thing is I feel like their should be more things to do in co op. Sure doing domains and walking around fighting monsters together is fun but after doing that again and again you get bored of the same thing. Also in co op you should be able to unlock statues of the seven without having to have the other person leave the game just to join back. Let‚Äôs be honest I spent money on Genshin :| almost all of us have their should be more ways to get primogems.",5
"Thank you so much miHoYo for your wonderful game! I highly recommend it to a lot of my peers because of the great graphics, storyline, characters, content, landscapes, and even the beautiful soundtrack. The game has so much more to it than just collecting characters and weapons, and we are actually given a wonderful world of our own to explore. Personally, I have been playing for the past year since launch and I am so grateful for all the hard work that you have put into this game! Happy anniversary, and I cannot wait to see what you guys have in store for us in the years to come! Thank you miHoYo!",5
"The content, characters, stories, and graphics are absolutely amazing. The hard work is very much appreciated, it‚Äôs amazing. The whole game is just so well put together and the anniversary web event is also really cool and cute. Amazing game, would very much recommend. The amount of detail of storylines, plot, and mysterious AND graphics are just amazing. 

***I don‚Äôt know why people are rating the game just on the anniversary rewards like that‚Äôs not all that‚Äôs in Genshin Impact. Appreciate the hard work of the company and the game. Stop complaining about anniversary rewards it‚Äôs not even that 
important it‚Äôs the game entirely that matters more.",5
"This game is really great! It‚Äôs super fun and time consuming. The devs obviously put lots of work in details because the gameplay is fun and different in each character/location. The art is extremely beautiful and the voice acting is TOP NOTCH (I play in japanese)! The game‚Äôs story is really interesting and each character has their own story thats intertwined with everything. Of course the game is not flawless (nothing ever is) and some fans are really entitled (but that just shows how popular the game is), but overall the game is really fun! I hope to be able to experience future updates and witness the end of the story.",5
This game is an overall success when I first got it I was amazed at the graphics and it has and AMAZING story line it‚Äôs fun to explore the world and collect new characters as progress through the game and when you get to certain adventure ranks you get better stuff I have one problem though I don‚Äôt know if I just wasn‚Äôt listening  or they didn‚Äôt do it but they didn‚Äôt tell us the best way to sped piogems  so I HAD a ton of em‚Äô and they all got WASTED I usually don‚Äôt write reviews like this but this was a big one to all the pepole debating about getting this app GET IT it‚Äôs amazing and I think everyone should have it ü§©ü§©ü§©ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥,5
"The reason for only 4-stars is because the game lags a bunch (even though I only use my cell phone provider‚Äôs data), which has caused me to miss hits on monsters during fights or dropping out of the sky because the wrong be button gets pushed (sometimes resulting in my death).

I really wish that I was able to buy a lot more of the items like carrots, mushrooms (Matsutake and regular), valberries, lotus flowers, fish, and fowl that are currently only available for purchase up to 10 per city (like...I want to be able to buy 100 a day. Maybe like 25 of the fowl and raw meat, also a day?)

Please...for the love of my sore, battle-broken fingers...make the flying creatures that turn into core crystals (or whatever they‚Äôre called) fly slower.

I know people complain about gacha games, and I guess this is one, but I‚Äôm very happy with the things I‚Äôve been able to get (slowly though) through primogems.

The locations, clothes, and characters are so detailed and different. There is so much to explore and see, and I hope we get to see more cities be introduced (since Mondstadt is an Anemo city and Liyue is a Geo city).",4
"I started this game a month or two after it came out and I absolutely loved it. The graphics and the fact that it‚Äôs so open world just make it even better. But one day as I was playing...a glitch happened. I was kicked out the game and lost all my data/account. I cried. I love the game and characters so much that i cried. But that‚Äôs not the point here what is the point is that i need a happy ending for kaeya and diluc, their backstories are so sad i was balling my eyes out. So mihoyo i‚Äôm begging you..please give them a good ending it can be anything even a simple apology and sibling hug for all i care. All i know is that they need a good ending. Anyways love the game!!üòÅüëç",5
"I‚Äôll be honest with you, this game is very addicting. The graphics are beautiful, the storyline is easily digestible, also very good and lovable characters. Though, the devs could be a little less stingy in regards to rewards for leveling up, events, domains, etc.‚Äî but I won‚Äôt take away points for something like that, because I, personally, don‚Äôt think that takes away from the quality of the game. This game is also free-to-play friendly! Though, I can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt spent money on this game, I‚Äôve played free-to-play for a good while before spending money. If you‚Äôre interested in games like these, try this one out! It‚Äôs really good.",5
"I‚Äôve been a strong fan with open world RPG games. I have played and experienced with a lot fun memories and awesome moments. Nevertheless, Genshin Impact gives a brand new experience for adventure that I really addict to. Even though I am not fan of anime style in gaming, the basic elements of this world is very much impressive and attractive to players. From the enemy and combats are so smooth and very cohesive. No sudden appearance or popping in. It‚Äôs truly innovative game and very addictive. I‚Äôm really amazed that level of hardwares like an iPad pro could handle such massive games like this is really the future of gaming. I wish I could have invested more time on mobile gaming like this before.",5
"I‚Äôm almost 40 and I play mobile games to pass time when just sitting idle.  Usually MOBA games because they last about 10-20 minutes. This game tho.... I have nothing bad to say about it.  The graphics, story line, playable characters, dialogue, fighting controls etc are all superb.  I‚Äôm surprised how in depth the story is.  The quests are not boring and take some time to complete too. This game is really engaging.  I actually had to uninstall because I noticed I sat and played for 4 hours yesterday during the snow storm.  That‚Äôs too much time for a guy my age to spend sitting playing a video game.  (I have family responsibilities.) That‚Äôs how good this game is.",5
"I‚Äôve never once played this game. I‚Äôm always stuck on downloading it, practically deleting two apps and putting everything else on offload, and that‚Äôs only for downloading! When I open the app it asks if I want the demo or the full game, naturally, you‚Äôd want the full game right? When I clicked on it nothing happened. That lasted for two straight hours and it wasn‚Äôt even my first time trying this.
I‚Äôve heard that this game is really good, it‚Äôs just a shame that some people can‚Äôt play it due to this reason. 
I do know that this is a big game and takes a lot, but it‚Äôs just disappointing that I can‚Äôt play it.",5
"This game is so fun the characters are sooo handsome and beautiful it makes me feel like I'm in anime world but I wish there was option to change the twins hairstyle,clothes and these cuz as we are supposed to be one of twin so I wish it was possible as I do not like the clothes of the twins as well as weapon i want a spear tbhüò£and I want a romance in it like twin with others I love childe sooooo much that I wanna try romance with him so pweaseeeee add romanceüò≠otherwise it's fun but please add these two if it will be added I'm sure it will be more interesting and popular cuz nowdays people like romance in rpg game and for the wish i wish there was more options to get primolegs(?) in it as it‚Äôs way to rare that makes me kinda stop playing genshin other than that it‚Äôs perfect",4
"I like this game, don‚Äôt get me wrong. The reason I‚Äôm rating 4 stars is because the day after I downloaded this game, my phone told me it couldn‚Äôt back up to the iCloud because there wasn‚Äôt enough space. Now, this is what concerns me because I don‚Äôt have more than 300 photos on my phone and I only had 4 games that don‚Äôt take up a lot of space. This was the fifth game I downloaded, so I know that I did have a lot of space but this game took up all the amount I had free. Since I had this small problem, I decided to play this game on my PlayStation instead of my phone for this reason and I‚Äôll have to say the controls are easier to use. Thank you for creating this game, it has beautiful graphics.",4
"Dear developers,

This game is off the charts. Like it‚Äôs not always about fighting like any other RPG games. This one, it‚Äôs all about adventure and discovery and the thrill to be part of the game itself. Like I can imagine being a part of storyline and I love the elemental symbols and it‚Äôs chain reaction, like you know, it make sense like if you cast pyro on dendro, which is wood and yeah it would catch fire. The graphics are crazy good and I‚Äôm an anime fan so this suits me well. However, I would REALLY appreciate if the game lag reduces. The lag seriously reduces the game‚Äôs true potential. And my phone gets overheated even after just 10 minutes of playing. Overall, pls reduce the lag. And then I will give u 5 stars. Thanks! Love the game, don‚Äôt stop improving!!!!",4
"It‚Äôs a great game so far, I just started playing a few hours ago. The only request I have is to be able to have the option of using my Kishi for days that my dexterity is compromised (a few spinal issues makes it hard to maneuver a little bit) at least to be able to run & rotate the screen. I‚Äôm playing on an iPad mini for now, but sometimes it can start to get heavy, but the game is worth adjusting to! It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve played a game like this or really much of any game & I‚Äôm having a bit of nostalgia of playing on a Play Station, minus the lagging so I definitely thank the developers for that lol! Keep being amazing!",4
This game is awesome unfortunately all mobile controls are difficult when our trying to do multiple movements with you character to dodge attack and switch characters all at once.  This game is amazing none the less I don‚Äôt own a pc so controller support would be awesome and it would benefit from its player base because controller supported games are becoming more popular. I believe this game would get left in the dust if another game similar to this would come out with controller support just for that reason. That I you love the game having load of fun. I can see myself playing it a lot more with controller support added that is the only downfall.,5
I could hear what was going on but it had a static sound to it and the pictures wouldn‚Äôt show much I only saw a about two images and heard the rest but besides that the game seems great sometimes my view of my character is covered by a light so I can‚Äôt see where I am going and it doesn‚Äôt let me see all the surroundings is it because I am using a iPad I don‚Äôt know also the water just looks black and it didn‚Äôt let me see the enemy if not for the lv 2 sign and health bar of it I wouldn‚Äôt know it was there I am now in a battle with storm terror but I can‚Äôt see my surroundings and so I can‚Äôt really fight him I am only able to get him with a attack when I Lom√© up with a sometimes visible red arrow thing,3
"Honestly started playing since 1.1 and I‚Äôve been mesmerized by the beautiful scenery and how much effort the team puts in to each update. This is the single most celebrated gaming community to ever exist and no game that is a copy cat can every reach. Love the graphics, love the story and always love the card game they introduced recently. I usually never spend longer times in games. Even if I did after few months I just give up and forget about it. But this game, I just can‚Äôt‚Ä¶. It is truly one of a kind, just wish there‚Äôs some dual modes and modes for leaderboards in card game",5
"I love all the effort put into the characters, the scenery and challenges, but the dialogue is something that annoys me. For quite a bit of dialogue the characters animations or voice acting is bad, and there‚Äôs lots of dialogue for many things in this game which just makes it worse. I want to read the dialogue to get the story, but a lot of the time it‚Äôs just a bunch just to explain a simple thing and I feel like it deserves to have revisions to cut some repetitive or unimportant lines. I also don‚Äôt like the way some of traveler‚Äôs responses are formatted especially for story quests because like both of them are a part of the same sentence and it‚Äôs just lacking effort",4
"As there are many aspects to the game, there are multiple reasons you should download the app. Positives: -Good RPG game -Great music -Amazing character designs -Meet new people or play with friends! (You can turn CO-OP off if you don‚Äôt want to play with people) -Good storyline! Even though the game has awesome aspects to it, there are some negatives before downloading this awesome app. Negatives: -Takes up a lot of storage -Too much lore to keep up with -Losing 50/50s (you will get a guaranteed 5 star after fortunately!) -Slow Loading-  Hopefully you can join this community and have fun exploring Teyvat! -stay away from the fan base-",5
"I just started playing this game this month, so i haven't gotten very far into the game, but it's really fun! I've fallen in love with the story and characters! I play moblie (obviously) and there are a few problems ive run into. 
The game crashes every 10-20 minutes, I don't know why? and deleting/redownloading the game did not fix the problem. It also takes up alot of storage, obviously since it's open world and all, but since i don't have a computer to play it on yet I've had to redownload the game when an update comes along, i have so little space xD. 
10/10 would recommend. Constantly trying to get my friends to play with me :D",4
"Just pray you don‚Äôt have any issues in the game. Because the customer service will not fix it or care about your issues. Was enjoying the game for a long time and foolishly spent too much money on it. Recently bought enough (talking a few hundred $ here‚Ä¶)to get a guaranteed weapon and was not given the correct item. Even after spending large amounts of money in the game customer service basically said too bad we don‚Äôt care. Take a lesson from me and don‚Äôt spend any money on this uncaring, unfriendly company. 

Lost over 300$ on their error and have put a lot more than that into the game over the 2 years. Even being a big spender warrants nothing more than a copy paste response from customer service. Unbelievable. TL/DR: Pray you don‚Äôt encounter any account issues cuz if you do you‚Äôre out of luck.",1
"I thought it would run horribly because of the graphics etc. but it‚Äôs incredibly smooth. I‚Äôve had it for awhile and the only issue is lag with text which doesn‚Äôt really matter. (I have an iphone 7 which heats up like a microwave). 

The only true downside is the controls :( it‚Äôs fairly impossible to dodge attacks and pick up things while running. This game is so much easier on PS but once you get the hang of it (took me awhile) then it‚Äôs not so bad. 
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to make the controls easier, the set up is actually not bad so don‚Äôt worry about it.
9/10 <3",5
"In the recent update, Genshin has somehow done everything in there power to white wash characters with melanin. To commodify and exploit people of colors stories, just to make a paler version of middle eastern and dark skin characters. Not only that, but there‚Äôs no end game. I waited a year to see sumeru and all it‚Äôs inspired glory, and I‚Äôm met with a husk of a colonial place. I‚Äòve never regretted anything as much as paying this company to essential give me bread crumbs of somewhat that might look like me, in an open world game that likes to preach about traveling to new places. I‚Äôm a day one player, and so help me god if I have to wait till Nathan to see a semblance of dark skin. Then it‚Äôs embarrassing to say I still play this game. If modding was allowed, I‚Äôd want to change the UVs of each of these sumeru characters. Apart from Collei, I‚Äôm utterly dissatisfied.",1
"I think the game itself is very intriguing and fun game for newcomers, >AR45 are bound to have dun getting characters, leveling them, all that pizazz. except, i find it a bit lazy how mobile players cant change the hub, unlike many other games. I also think it is unnecessarily laggy for some mobile players too. not to mention the updates are incredibly big, and mobile players can only have so much storage for genshin. not only this, but the company lacks the care to actually do their research and add more diverse skintones to a batch of characters from region based on the swana region. it is incredibly lazy and shows how careless they are. mihoyo changed to hoyoverse to cater to a larger variety of people, so please step up your game mihoyo.",3
"Hoyoverse,
I love this game, I have spent a lot of time and money on it. I love the well thought out designs of the characters however, with the recently released characters from Sumeru, I as well as many others, notice a lack of diversity despite characters having ethnic names, outfits, or styles. If you are basing a nation off of a region where the majority of people are brown, (Middle East and South Asia) you should make the characters darker as well. The community wants you all to change for the better, yet we haven‚Äôt seen any change or feedback from the company. Please listen to your fans! I love this game and have been playing for over a year. I would rate it five stars if the upcoming update of 3.0 wasn‚Äôt so disappointing. Please add more people of color to the 3.0 cast. It isn‚Äôt too late to change.",1
"Genshin Impact has been my favorite game for years now, and it has a special place in my heart. As a player who's sat through huge updates and events, I can say that I wish rewards were actually rewards. I'm currently AR 55 and when I can finally hit 56, my reward will be a single wish on the standard banner. Other then the sad amount of rewards we get, the diversity in the game is naught. At the time of this review, the Sumeru cast has been announced (Tighnari, Collei, Dori). They're all pale. A nation based on a real life area where there's plenty of sun to create a diverse palette of skin tones, and yet everyone is glowing bright white. It's disappointing, and I don't want to drop the world of Teyvat, but as a POC, I've been told to ""wait"" for my representation for too long. I hope Hoyoverse makes the right decisions to please and protect their audience.",1
"I‚Äôve had this game for a little over a year and it has been a lot fun since day one. I think this game is perfect, and it has beautiful design‚Äôs.(I do have a recommendation for newer players), I have always recommended that you do more of the combat related stuff in early game so it‚Äôs easier to do combat in later game, and level up your characters and weapons as soon as possible and only dedicate to one or two dedicating to your full team will make everything too expensive and you can‚Äôt keep up with the price. Anyways I hope you enjoy this game like I have been! :)",5
"I started Genshin Impact in June 2021. I remember doing the first quest, then afterwards, just sitting around in Mondstat, listening to the music. I stopped playing for about 3 months, and when I returned, everything was different. The Raider Shogun‚Äôs banner has just been released, and the graphics had improved. I decided to pick up the game again. Now at adventure rank 41, I can confidently say that Genshin Impact is my favorite game I have ever played. It feels like there is always something to do or explore, and yes, even saving Reckless Pallad is fun. Give this game a shot if you have too much time on your hands, I promise, you won‚Äôt regret it.",5
"genshin is really fun you can play free which is really hard to do because you‚Äôll want all the amazing characters they come out with  but if you do pay i suggest spending it on some amazing person caus ur bank account gonna be empty by the time ur done. anyways genshin is a great game, amazing story, amazing everything it‚Äôs just a really good game in general i love all the characters they‚Äôre all super cool some are better than others but most of them are really cool and useful in my opinion i love xiao he‚Äôs just so fine bro but that‚Äôs my opinion which is like a really good one so yeah just marry me xiao",5
Ive been playing Genshin Impact for a while and in the beginning I found it hard and annoying but then one of my friends said they played so I started again and it was so great! Some parts of the story are hard but that‚Äôs what makes it a challenge. I saw some reviews saying they‚Äôre mad because they didn‚Äôt get a character they wanted or they‚Äôre not getting five stars but with you‚Äôve pulled 90 times you‚Äôll get one guaranteed. Usually they come around 70-80 pulls and I actually got my prized Diluc at around 20 pulls. They recently added Inazuma which is more ways to get primogems. Thanks for the awesome game!,5
"I LOVE THIS GAME. it‚Äôs been my favorite game for five months, the characters, the stories, quests, ALL OF IT IS PERFECT!!! but the only problem I have is with the stupid glitches!! i‚Äôll be on the app, in the middle of a battle, and the app with just send me to my home screen and i have to reload the app :( the same thing happens (sometimes) when i click any important button that would send me to a diff screen (for example: party set up, the lil wish store, settings etc) and it‚Äôs the worst!! sometimes i wont even try and play because of how glitchy it is sometimes! but i‚Äôll power through and just hope something gets fixed soon bc i truly love this game",4
"From the title you can probably guess where I am on the level bracket. I absolutely adore the game and fell in love with the lore that came along with it. The aspect that you could also get a bunch of enjoyment just from the gameplay also drew me in quite a bit, to the point I‚Äôve put up with playing on mobile all the way to AR55.

Even so, I‚Äôd say my biggest gripe lies with being a high AR. There‚Äôs simply nothing to do anymore aside from logging on, doing commissions, spending your resin, and repeat every day. There isn‚Äôt any late game content that high AR players are rewarded with. When you compare it to other games such as WOW(it‚Äôs an mmo, not a open world rpg, I know) and it‚Äôs late game content you can be fairly disappointed.

Even so, Genshin Impact is one of my favorite games. Coop with people is fun if you find the right people, and at the very least you get one event and story update every month or so. Because of this, and how vast and fun the early gameplay is Genshin Impact is on my top recommended list for games.

Just don‚Äôt become a gambling addict, <3",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since it released, and the extra materials in my inventory are really stacking up. Especially berries. I have way too many of those. I enjoy the combat and travel, and the story is good. I am having my own issues with finding the last few books and fully upgrading both statues, nothing glitch-related, just bad memory. That was a tangent, but anyway, I wish that you could sell a limited amount of materials to the shops, because I have extra, and I use my mora almost as soon as I get it. The graphics are amazing though, and I like the weather and day/night cycle actually affecting things.",4
"The game is really fun when you‚Äôre first starting out with a large world to explore and story to enjoy, but once you reach higher levels (around AR 50) and you‚Äôre able to beat the Spiral Abyss, you realize that there‚Äôs nothing else to do except wait absurd amounts of time for your Resin to recharge and spend your Resin on bad artifacts or other domains to try and min max your characters. It feels like the only content left to do is make your characters better or build new characters, but the resources feel so scarce and the RNG is so bad that it‚Äôs painful to try and get every character functioning. This game needs some kind of repeatable end game content that doesn‚Äôt take 2 weeks to reset and can be beaten in 30 minutes.",3
"for context, I started playing in november last year, and continued consistently playing every day til around june this year. the game‚Äôs visuals, voice acting, and combat are fantastic. far better than most free mobile games.

 however, it‚Äôs so difficult to actually experience it for so many reasons. the resin refills so slow, and you clear it so fast, to where there‚Äôs only 20ish minutes of content a day. events are either as boring as possible, or give little rewards. some events are even only on their website(which only ever gives minuscule rewards). 

what has transpired as of late is the final straw for me with this game. i‚Äôve spent ~70$ on it but i‚Äôm exhausted. the team does not listen to any criticism that fans give. trying to cover this up with hastily made and unplanned replacement events won‚Äôt work. good day to you all.",1
"This is one of my favorite games of all time, but recently Mihoyo has started making decisions so bad that it makes me wonder if they are trying to kill the game. Every character that has come out since 2.0 is either fundamentally broken or doesn‚Äôt work as intended, the anniversary rewards are beyond horrible, we still don‚Äôt have a roadmap, Raiden Shogun‚Äôs story quest was horrible, the teapot has been neglected hard, the resin cap needs to be increased, esc. Yes every game has it‚Äôs problems, but the fact that Mihoyo knows that all these problems exist but deliberately chose to ignore them at the expense of the community is incredibly scummy and wrong. I can not in good conscious recommend this game to anyone until the company at very least admits wrong and apologizes.",1
"If you‚Äôre really looking for a great game on your phone when you have no console or computer‚Ä¶ GENSHIN IMPACT IS IT!!!! Honestly, this game exceeded my expectations and it keeps getting better and better every time I play it. Not only does Liuye looks like China with the music and scenery, but it‚Äôs Inazuma that caught my attention right away because I‚Äôm OBSESSED with Japanese culture! When I didn‚Äôt have my Nintendo Switch with me, the first thing I thought of was Breath of the Wild when i saw the graphics, world and even the tactics every character has. I hope they do get it on the switch though that would be AMAZING!!! Thank you so much MiHoyo!!! üëèüèº",5
"My friend really wants my Diona from the Yoimiya banner and anytime she wishes she can‚Äôt get her and she really loves her and I have Diona and I really don‚Äôt like her that much, and I want Xinyan or Sayu my friend that wants Diona has both of them and would love my Diona but we are not able to trade and give away our unwanted characters to for the characters we want so like we can trade Stardust, Primogems, characters, and Interwine fates, and the other wish, and maybe like the summer outfits, and maybe artifacts etc.. so we‚Äôre able to give away unwanted characters and get the ones we like and so we don‚Äôt have to trade accounts etc..",5
"I love the game so much been playing for a while but I would‚Äôve gave it five stars if it had the choice to transfer all my data from my iOS of the game to my PlayStation. I want to keep playing the game but it‚Äôs difficult through iOS so I thought I could download it on my PlayStation and login from my account from my phone to PlayStation but I can‚Äôt. I had to make a whole different account which I didnt want to, not just that I can‚Äôt log out of it and try a different account. I think the game would be a lot better if players were able to transfer their PC or iOS data/account to a PlayStation 4 or Playstation 5. So mihoyo if you are seeing this please I hope you guys can add cross safe onto PlayStation Network.",3
OK just a disclaimer I don‚Äôt know if this is an update or not but The map looked really confusing  to me and was hard to get a around. It was just really confusing and I had to zoom all the way to just to see my waypoint‚Äôs. Also for some reason it is being a little laggy and I do have an iPhone higher than six. Also sorry if it looks like I‚Äôm trying to be rude but i‚Äôm not I just really want this to be fixed because it‚Äôs hard to get around for me. But either way I give this game a five star review because of its graphics and it‚Äôs amazing storyline and Characters.,5
"Claim 1: I didn‚Äôt get the character I wanted

Good for you, you are among the 80% of people that didn‚Äôt get her/him. 

Claim 2: no primo gems to do anything

If you actually worked in the game you would earn them f2p (spiral abyss, dailies, events, quests, etc) I have 6 5 stars as a f2p

Claim 3: 2FA 

I agree actually, however they said they would implement in the next update so yeah

Claim 4: lag

It‚Äôs meant for a pc, so on phone it will lag a lot. Don‚Äôt give a game up and write a 1 star review BC of lag.

Claim 5: too hard

Once you start playing and get used to it, it is hard to find challenges in this game. I can easily clear some bosses in under a minute.

Claim 6: botw copy
While a lot of this game is from botw (taken or inspired) they each have their own different aspects that sets them apart. For example, the combat, the puzzles, the areas, etc.

Overall great game, but resin is a big problem that prevents us from progressing much. I think 1 resin per 6 minutes is fair enough.",5
"I‚Äôm a fan of botw. (Breath of the wild). so when my sister recommended this because of that, I downloaded it and tried it. Not the best game, but the best FREE game. A botw youtuber tried it, spent 6 hours, then I saw a comment that said he barely even made a dent in this game. I believe it. I kinda wanna play as I‚Äôm writing this. The thing that everyone loves, is that:

No crappy graphics or lag, what most free games have.

It‚Äôs huge, and free, and doesn‚Äôt take much to download.

The characters are adorable. I love their clothing.

It‚Äôs addicting and easy to play because of no lag. I haven‚Äôt had any slowing of my game.

No ads. The thing that cheezes people off the most. The thing that most game companies screwed up on.
 
The story. It‚Äôs epic. And large. And so much to explore.

The far away mountains and buildings are literal art.

This list could go on and on and on. But, I‚Äôm going to save your time of the day where you could be playing this.

Ps, this took a little while to write. I hope you enjoy the game, and the rest of your day. Byee",5
"This is hands down one of the greatest RPG games of all time. I mean, what can you expect? Mihoyo is fantastic when it comes to creating games (another wonderful one is Honkai Impact 3rd, which led me to have my high expectations of this game). I will try to keep this nice and short.
The graphics are one of the best I‚Äôve ever seen in any game I‚Äôve ever downloaded or looked at. They‚Äôre so beautiful- download and see for yourself.
The story is very intriguing and interesting. And Paimon is just such a cutie!
I do really like the wish system (very very similar to the supply drops in Honkai Impact 3rd) however I‚Äôve been buying and buying but no such luck of me getting Klee (then again I‚Äôm very obsessed about getting Klee because she‚Äôs just soooo adorable and definitely my favorite playable character!).
So, overall, this game is very worth the download as it is simply stunning and one of the greatest games on the App Store.

And a big congratulations to Mihoyo with yet another incredible game that I‚Äôm downright obsessed with! :)

"Amazing... I am speechless at the size of this game... this game is absolutely huge, the map is insane comparable to the size of large console games and with good graphics too. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because all though everything is great... it took me awhile to get the hang of it and my progress has been a little slow. I wish the mainstory wasnt so heavilty spaced out between levels. I just got my first story in awhile after i spent all day getting to level 15 then after 20 minutes its over and ill have to do side tasks until level 26.... Additionally I wish I could get new characters more frequently and better guidance about what to actually do to fill in the gaps and gain levels between main story quests",4
"This is an amazing game that you will not want to put down. Literally you will spend all day playing and not even know it.
 
The graphics, amazing. Combat, amazing. Story, amazing. 

There are only a couple issues.

#1) not enough content, it‚Äôs been only 5 days since release and I have already finished almost everything. I am Adventure rank 33 and now all there is to do is search for chests, I have literally finished everything else. 

#2) the co-op leaves much to be desired. No real incentive to do co-op. Want to see more multiplayer options & benefits. Things you can only achieve by co-op (for example really hard large raids or bosses)

#3) there should be a way to extract materials. There is a set amount of materials in the game (mostly through chests & quests). Once those are completed, it‚Äôs extremely hard to find weapons or accessories. You then upgrade your current gear, to find better gear later.... but you have already spent most of your resources on those precious weapons. Need to have a resource extraction system.

Other than these 3, game is amazing! More work to do though!",4
"I loved this game from head to toe, the graphics were stunning and the gameplay was amazing. I fought numorous battles. Unlocked hundreds of chests and played the game from morning to night. But the thing is that when i got the game mobile the graphics were just black and white screens. So I tried it on computer! It was awesome! The game worked a lot better and I enjoyed it a lot! Until I noticed the downloading speed of the game. It was absolutely terrible, it would take days on end to load pages and the other games that I installed just would not work. So sadly I had to delete it. But other than that I had a fantastic time playing this game!",5
"I have genshin on 3 different devices of mine; My phone, My PC and My PS4. On my phone, it‚Äôs a little hard to play the game because it‚Äôs hard to attack and if you even hold the attack button then they do a charged attack and on my phone, I main Noelle and Razor is my main DPS. On my PC: it‚Äôs weird, if you don‚Äôt have a mouse, well‚Ä¶you‚Äôre screwed because the look and attack is so hard to do- and finally PS4: I enjoy PS4 than the other two- the attack button is easy to do just one press and (of what I know of/where I am in the story) you don‚Äôt need to get any extra things (Like you do for a PC) that is my reviews, but I may just be bad at the game.",4
"So, I downloaded this game on release day, on my PS4. It‚Äôs an amazing game with gorgeous graphics and good gameplay. When I found out it was also on iOS, I wasn‚Äôt sure how well that would carry over. But the mobile controls are well integrated, and I almost like some of them more than my PS4 controls. 
However, while this game is cross-play and cross-save, it unfortunately cannot cross-save with the PS4 (most likely due to Sony and not the creators of the game). I play around with the mobile version, just because I enjoy the game, but I would spend a lot more time on it if it was actually able to link to the account I play on at home.",5
"The game is really good overall but i wish you could trade items, mora, and characters with your friends because sometimes you don‚Äôt really want your character but you can‚Äôt get rid of it, and it also gives others a chance to get characters they dream of that might not be available, i simply just think trading would be a really good update, like being able to trade with your friends! Please give it some thought, I, especially, would ADORE trading and would probably recommend the game to more people if there was trading because it‚Äôs just a good aspect!",5
Now before anything else- I love this game. It‚Äôs great and fun and I always play when I‚Äôm bored. There‚Äôs a slight problem though‚Äî This randomly started happening yesterday where my game keeps freezing mid battle and other places. This never happened to me before and my ms has been fine but then all of that happened randomly. And it kept getting worse to the point where it disconnects me from the servers. And time based things like in spiral abyss I can‚Äôt beat cause it freezes and the timer still runs in game. This is a serious problem and keeps me from actual playing the game. Please try to fix this unless it‚Äôs gonna be hard for some players to even play and eventually might quit.,3
"This is my FAVVVV game and i love it! its the best, but my one complaint is that why did u make yoimiya‚Äôs banner come again? u could have done a Eula rerun or a Raiden rerun, but u picked yoimiya AGAIN! And i thought that layla would have her banner!!! I don‚Äôt think yoimiya‚Äôs banner right now would not get much money. Please do some other banner instead of the same person again! nobody really is happy that she is back again, like why??????? is she soooooo important that u could not have waited 5 months or 4 months? i dont know what your up to but im just saying, please stop bringing peoples reruns when they just had there banners. Thank you for reading this and i hope u will change.",4
"The game has a lot of content, and a lot of it is fun. Going into it as the mindset of open world first, gacha second helps a lot with the constant new 5 star units at admittedly very low rates. They are a luxury and can be forgone, so it‚Äôs recommended against pulling for units until you have a guarantee saved up The issue is once that content is done, all that‚Äôs left is rolling for equipment with your daily energy, essentially a lottery. The events are more than generous, despite what you hear; the model is that the events happen frequently with constant rewards surrounding them. Between collectables and constant drops, there‚Äôs always something to do, just at the moment a hollow endgame.",4
"Yeah, I‚Äôm AR60 and still playing this game. I got successfully addicted and every time I‚Äôm thinking about quitting, the devs roll out another update that makes me stick around for a bit more. 

That being said, I spent literally $0.00 on this game. Never gambled for pulls or bought the Moon pass, so I‚Äôm happy to let everyone know that I‚Äôve spent more money on useless loot boxes in Overwatch than on fictional characters in a gacha game. If you believe you can‚Äôt stop yourself from making bad financial decisions, then that‚Äôs on you. 

There‚Äôs enough content. It rolls out pretty often with new quests and events but if you want to spend 2-3 hours a day every day on a game, then once you reach the endgame, take a break.",3
"This game has an amazing storyline if there was a word that could describe it better than amazing I would use it the character designs are great and each character has their own unique abilities and weapons it's a very pretty open world game and the lands are so beautiful my favorite being sumeru so far. You can have multiple teams of 4 characters and can switch them out and you can get materials by fighting bosses,mobs,or getting materials like flowers scattered throughout the nations. I really recommend anyone who loves a good story to play this.",5
"I haven‚Äôt been part of the Fanbase, and I haven‚Äôt been playing the game for a while, but there is a lot of skin color issues + diversity issues in the game, specifically the Sumeru update. As someone who is WHITE from levantine, almost ALL of the characters are based off harmful sterotypes, have lack of melanin, etc. I KNOW this company can properly represent the characteristics of someone based off a certain region GREATLY. For example, Yun Jin has great cultural rep. and she is overall a great character. I KNOW you guys can do the same for Sumeru, AND I KNOW you guys can give the characters more melanin especially if you already made characters with accurate representation. It‚Äôs never too late for a re-design, so please consider!",3
"But there are a lot of issues with how they design new characters. I‚Äôve been playing this
game for almost two years and I‚Äôve sunk hundreds of hours farming artifacts, Primogems, and character materials. I reached ar58 like two days ago. But after seeing the new characters drip marketed for Sumeru, I‚Äôm legitimately disgusted by Hoyoverse. The fact that they can get away with representing a South Asian/Middle East/North African culture through pale, stereotypical designs is disgusting. Not to mention throwing in many diverse cultures into one pot, stirring it around, and spitting it out as one extremely orientalist culture is repulsive considering the SPECIFIC design elements that they used in Inazuma, Liyue, and Mondstadt. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in Hoyoverse, and I hope this reaches the right people so it can fix some of these problems",2
"The lack of representation for characters over the shade of paper is absolutely appalling. No matter how good gameplay is or storyline, in this year, I cannot accept a game with I believe currently 51 playable characters, only having two with darker skin tones. This is unacceptable in all honesty. The colorism this game has shown, especially with recent leaks for Sumeru, is so beyond disappointing. The new characters meant to drop within the next few updates are so disappointingly pale given that they are meant to be of Arabic/middle eastern descent. While I understand that there are people of all different shades in those regions in real life, I don‚Äôt believe that ALL the newer characters coming in currently should be pale, it is clear that this is due to prejudice against people of other colors and upholds views of white supremacy.",1
"OKAY. LITERALLY ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER, to start off. There is one change that I would be SO happy to see. If you could unlevel up characters, that would be awesome! Regaining the stuff that you needed before. From there on out, it‚Äôs a beautiful game with beautiful places and beautiful characters! There‚Äôs so much to do, it never gets old! Even for endgame players, there will never be an end! It‚Äôs very interesting and emotional and leaves a, well, ‚Äúimpact‚Äù on all of those who play it. If you need something to do in your free time and enjoy fabulous (and I don‚Äôt use that word a lot) games, this is the best for you! I love it and im sure everyone else will! <3",5
"I love this app and everything about it but recently I haven‚Äôt been able to use it. Idk why but whenever I try and enter my world it says connection timed out, please try again. It‚Äôs really annoying and I haven‚Äôt been able to play for days because of this. I‚Äôve uninstalled the app and switched accounts but it just won‚Äôt let me in. I‚Äôve checked for updates too but there are none.. I‚Äôm just genuinely confused and I don‚Äôt know what to do to fix it. It‚Äôs been almost a week since this started and I‚Äôve only have been able to get into the game twice but then it would disconnect me or be extremely laggy. I don‚Äôt want to give up on the game so please fix this so I can keep playing :) I love your work and all and I want to experience more of it but please fix this!!",1
"i‚Äôve been playing for a while, it‚Äôs pretty good actually. It‚Äôs my favorite game, but for mobile people it just takes so much storage. I mostly play on pc, but on mobile it takes lots of 
storage, but not complaining It‚Äôs still good though. so all I got to say mostly is, it‚Äôs an amazing game. (I‚Äôm so happy that hu tao is coming soon!) I‚Äôd really like them to add like more stuff like:
1. pyro oceanid maybe 
2. make the characters have more act in the story‚Äôs and stuff
3. I‚Äôd kinda like a amber hangout, it sound pretty weird but I just think we should hang out with amber a little more.
that‚Äôs really all I have to say for those, but honestly I love the quality, the gameplays, the story, the updates, and the characters are amazing. I can‚Äôt wait for 2.3, I wonder what they will do for it.
but the thing is most people finish the like archon quests stuff things, and they just have to wait for another in the next update. which there is lots of stuff to do in genshin, but yeah, just saying. good game though!",5
"This game is amazing! The graphics were surprisingly great, there was barely any lag! I love how you have to work for your characters unlike other games where they just give it to you, honestly when they do that it makes it boring cause you already have like everything.üòÉ When I do get a 5 star I feel like I have accomplished something and it make me so happy! More people should play this gameü§©ü§©ü§©ü§© Also the story line is awesome! I was so surprised!!!!!!!! MiHoyo you have done an AMAZING JOB and I mean it! I got the card problem fixed but now even when the bars are green the game still crashes. Hasn‚Äôt stopped me from playing though",4
"You‚Äôll likely have hours of fun in this game getting to the endgame. The work the artists put into this game is incredible, absolutely fantastic world they‚Äôve created. Fun combat once you luck into some half decent characters. All this for free! Amazing! Unfortunately, eventually you will hit the endgame, and you‚Äôll need to farm for artifacts to optimize your team. Have a character you‚Äôre building for a specific role? Well, you are going to have to luck into the correct artifact stats, and I do mean, literally, luck into it. You could never get what you need, you could spend thousands (which I‚Äôm sure is why the system is so horribly designed) and you may never get the artifact you need. It‚Äôs the worst part of the game. It‚Äôs absolutely horrid.

Update: The people in charge of monetization have completely lost their minds.  

Can‚Äôt recommend.",1
"This game is truly magnificent. From watching the sun set off of the peak of a mountain, to fighting a water deity, it has it all. At first, I thought this game was just one of those average gacha anime RPG games. I couldn‚Äôt of been further off the mark. I‚Äôve spent countless hours on this game, and it was all worth it. The frequency of the updates makes everything better, and the multiplayer option is really helpful for friends. The only downside of this game is the sheer size. Right now, it‚Äôs 9gb, and that‚Äôs not even counting the newest update! I know that with all the items in this game, it has to be that big, but I think the storage size is a turn off for some people. All in all, a great game that I‚Äôd recommend to all my friends.",4
"I love the game, it‚Äôs so entertaining and fun! I like some gacha games but mostly I dislike them, but when I saw this RPG game it caught my eye! As a kid I like this and it‚Äôs very fun! I play for hours until night and even on my way to school-. lol it might get addicting but it awesome and fun to play. There‚Äôs not much bugs other then hulchirls (sorry if I spelt it wrong) running into rocks and glitching but that‚Äôs normal and it actually gives me a chance to attack. But the cutscenes and voice acting is literally so good! I recommend playing this if your 12 or 13 higher can be average too, but yeah it‚Äôs cool and addicting I recommend it very much! :]",5
i play on iphone 11 and don‚Äôt even have max GB on my phone but it plays super smoothly for me and it‚Äôs really nice playing with other people in co-op because they can be very helpful. you‚Äôll be surprised how many friends you can make on here but sometimes there isn‚Äôt much to do when resin runs out. (hope more resin gets added) they consistently have new events every month and some for very limited times and occasionally a free character to play with ! i‚Äôve had the game since release which honestly isn‚Äôt even a year old so i can‚Äôt wait for what else is coming to the game! :) try it out !,5
"I love this game very much because of the details and the gameplay experience of the game. I play on a tablet and despite the game being super fun, I have two complaints which are that this game is super laggy (to fix that issue, I turn my graphics down) and second, it makes my tablet lose battery super fast. I love this game but it is a pain to having to keep charging it while I‚Äôm either playing or playing for 30 minutes or an hour just to charge it for the rest of the day. Wish this game had an alternative for low end devices :C",5
"ay guys dont listen to the one star review because at least half of them are calling this game ‚Äúhomophobic‚Äù (do y‚Äôall even know what that means...?) or ‚Äúracist‚Äù but this game is based on pure luck and rng. Mihoyo isnt in charge of giving people the characters, its the rng system. I didnt get characters i wanted but im not complaining because thats just my luck.

Anyways its a really fun game that has so many free to play friendly elements. The map is really cool and big so you can just wander forever and have so much content. It can be pretty slow on mobile and sometimes kick you out, but it‚Äôs still a really cool game.",5
"I‚Äôve been having a hard time sticking with mobile games, but this is exactly what I needed!! This game is so beautiful and does not hound you with ads at all like normal mobile games do nowadays, you have to seek out something to buy...an absolute god send of a game. If you like breath of the wild or open world fighting/adventure games I 100% recommend it. I‚Äôve already talked to multiple people about how great of a game this is. This game was completely free!! That‚Äôs crazy, especially with what you get from the game...this is a game that would be worth the average $60, it‚Äôs definitely worth it, but the fact that it‚Äôs free...wow, thank you developers and everyone else!",5
"Dont let the fact that there is a gacha-like system scare you off. I got this game yesterday and havent been able to put it down. Its inventive combat system is both complex and easily grasped. Its lore and world building deep. And its variety of quests never leave you bored. The sound design is great, and much of the dialog is fully voiced.

If you enjoy games like breath of the wild: youll love this game.

My only complaint and its more my problem is on my ipad pro which is a bit old the cutscenes are laggy... it would benefit from a graphics option for that... but otherwise the game can run on high graphics fine.

Seriously highly recommend.

Gameplay 10/10

Variety 8/10

Sound design 9/10

Wallet fairness: seems decent. Your able to get everything for free at least...

All the game needs is ports to xbox and switch and cross saves across all versions (currently no ps4 cross saves cause sony....) and it could easily beat out some of the more popular jrpgs.

Also on steam for you pc users. Use this for playing on the go though.",5
"So let‚Äôs start with the positives. Take the BOTW formula and make it faster and you have Genshin! This games quality is insane and I recommend it to anyone looking for a new game to get lost in! The combat is great and the world is full of puzzles to solve and the new co op event has blown my mind. As for the negatives: unlocking new characters requires the in game currency ‚Äú primogems‚Äù. I normally wouldn‚Äôt have a problem paying for add on characters but this game locks characters behind a lottery system! This is questionable game design and on top of that the chance to get a 5 star character is 0.6%  yes you read that right! Any regular person seeing these odds is sure not to spend a dime. If you‚Äôre looking for something fun to play you‚Äôve found it, just don‚Äôt open your wallet!",3
"So, I downloaded this game today because I saw YouTubers playing it and it seemed pretty fun. I was right! The demo is really interesting and it definitely made me want to get the full version!

But‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt. I play on an iPad, which only has 32GB and the full version needs, like, 13GB. It‚Äôs honestly a bit ridiculous in my opinion, that‚Äôs nearly half the iPad storage! I didn‚Äôt want to delete stuff on my iPad because it‚Äôs also my personal device (I don‚Äôt have a phone yet) and I‚Äôm not going to delete over half of my apps just for this one thing. I‚Äôm just too attached to the progress in them, lol, and some of the apps are needed. I understand that there‚Äôs a lot more stuff in the full version that the demo doesn‚Äôt offer, but it takes up THAT much space, which I don‚Äôt have. 

However, I enjoyed my time playing the demo, and when I get a phone I‚Äôll definitely download the full version. I highly recommend you get this! 
                                                                                       ~Ghost",4
"So I‚Äôve been playing this since day 1. Let me start from the beginning. I‚Äôve immense myself into playing this new game and fully experienced the excitement and fun in this game! This is the type of game people who has played Seven deadly sins, Brave Frontier, Unison league, etc. As soon as the extra farming kicked in. I soon have to be weary on what to farm. Why? Well everything is very expensive! From doing domains (20), Ley lines (20), or World Bosses (60). I mean with the recent update adding 40 more resin it literally means 2 more domains or 1 extra boss a day. And all of this can probably be achieved 10mins. They really need to reduced timer limit to 2 - 4mins. And this getting RPG of the year and only giving us 800 primogems is really messed up!!! We all need 30 wish for free for this type of achievements (game of the year). So I‚Äôm giving this a 1* Bcuz they really need to fix this problem.",1
"I love Genshin Impact so much, but I can think of a few problems. For f2p players like me who dont spend in game money, primogems are impossible to get. Ive gotten pretty far in the game, and it is not generous. Everything costs so much to upgrade, and rolling for weapons or characters are luxuries. I wish you would get daily primogem rewards because ive run out of quests and any ways to earn primogems. Also, resin is still pretty low. Most items are locked behind resin, and so many items are given so sparingly. I would say for new players, do not rush the game! I ran through the game, and I don‚Äôt have much to do anymore.",5
So I downloaded the app on my phone freed up storage and everything but when I played the game the Home Screen was black but I didn‚Äôt notice how that wasn‚Äôt what the game was supposed to look like so I just decided to press play. The cutscene glitches out so I couldn‚Äôt see the characters and the audio was messed up too! And when I actually started to play the game the sky and ocean were pure black! I did everything I could think of but it wouldn‚Äôt work I even deleted and reinstalled the app! In the end I just couldn‚Äôt play but not because of the black sky and ocean but because every time I try to play the game after a while the game goes pitch black settings don‚Äôt work either I put it on its lowest graphics and it looks the same so until this is fixed I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll play in sometime.,2
"It‚Äôs unbelievable how beautiful this game is.  I get totally consumed by the environment and story.  The controls are solid.  Gliding is amazing.  It‚Äôs hard to believe this is a mobile game, it‚Äôs that good.  Plus it‚Äôs f2p with no ads!  So far I haven‚Äôt needed to buy anything but I did anyway because I believe in supporting the devs when a game lets me choose to buy stuff instead of requiring it or bombarding me with ads.  I‚Äôm playing on an iphone 11 and the game runs flawlessly, although it will drain the battery so I keep it plugged in.  It‚Äôs taking 7gb of memory so make sure you‚Äôve got the space needed.  I can see I‚Äôll be playing this game for a very long time.",5
"This game is such an excellent game that it should be called an experience and a must play if you want to be part of the new generation of gaming. I have only been playing for and hour and I can already get a grasp of what this game and where is going and it is just gorgeous. It is quite unbelievable that this game was release for mobile devices I can already feel how the gaming industry is evolving to the next generation. A lot of people will say that it looks similar to BOTW and they have a point it kinda looks similar and some mechanics are similar too, but play the game and you will see that is a completely different experience.",5
Like title says there is one downfall which eventually will lead to players leaving which is the lack of summons in the game without paying. Got to level 30 and opened up most of the map and got maybe halfway to pity before running out of summon chances. I cant progress in anything other then story which is iffy since if thats the only thing i can progress then id rarher not play due to the game becoming stale with one thing to do. Have more ways to get summons or give them out more frequently would benefit the playerbase more then making the players be on the edge of starvation with summons which is a big part of the game especially with them brining out banners so often and ftp cant keep up.,3
"I never thought id get to this point on leaving a negative review. Dont get me wrong, the lore is well thought out, the characters and visuals are breathtaking, the mechanics are awesome, and much more. However, the way they are treating newer characters(namely the ones with darker skin tones, like dehya, cyno, xinyan, and candace), is horrible. I believe this is mainly on the kit creators part, but hoyo is also in the wrong for not doing anything about this. Dehya, the most recent character, has one of the biggest parts of the story, relatable background, great design, etc, has a VERY bad kit. We‚Äôve all seen the issues, from the multipliers, the intervals between the attacks, the cooldowns and downtime, and even the way you cant jump during her burst or it will cancel the burst. Seems like hoyo is waiting for this to die down and move on like nothing happened.",1
"Every review has a ‚Äúbut‚Äù, but(ik right) when I say it I mean it. Genshin‚Äôs characters and storyboard are perfect. It took me  forever to get to Adv. rank 19(please make that easier) Now to get to what I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶

   In Genshin there is no racial differentiation. To all those Genshin players, have you ever seen a mixed or brown person(I don‚Äôt like the word black bc they‚Äôre not ‚Äúblack‚Äù) I would love to see a miked or brown person in the game, that would make the experience so much better. I feel that not putting a person that isn‚Äôt Asian is racist. Also, could you put a avatar creator in there?",5
"I love this game. I‚Äôve recommended it countless times to people but one question stands out amongst many. Why has Anthony been in the fountain. I‚Äôve seen him in the fountain and on the side, however, i‚Äôve never seen him get in or out of the fountain. I‚Äôve wondered if theres lore of why he‚Äôs in the fountain. Could he believe that the water on his toes could help him think more about Anna and how to help her get better. He‚Äôs the only character that will stand in the fountain. Also, what does Anna have? Covid 19? It would be a funny addition for the game but i feel like theres more behind Anthony and Anna",5
The best part about this is an adventure game you‚Äôre gonna have a lot of mentors do all this fun stuff one day when I was going to play gentian impact here is one of the problems and made me put in the ID or something like that and a password so I tried to ID one of my IDs and it did not work and I tried another another another and it wouldn‚Äôt work I tried so many times I deleted the app and I download it again I try that I asked your friend for help that‚Äôs at work I wasn‚Äôt able to play it for months but still it was a good game for the 13 months I could play without my ID,5
"This game is amazing! From the breathtaking art style to the interactive open-world design, this game truly had everything anyone would want, for both casual and competitive players! The characters are not two dimensional, with most having captivating backstories, and many of their backstories linking together, which really adds to the attention-grabbing atmosphere to the game. 

Anyone can succeed when it comes to the fighting layout, even if you have no videogame experience! The gacha aspect of the game is really addicting, and has me crossing my fingers every time! It really makes me be on the edge of my seat, and I can find myself playing this for hours on end. 

One complaint is how long the app takes to load, and how much space it takes on my phone, but thats fine since its easily the only game I need! Overall, its an amazingly well-thought out action adventure, for all ages and preferences!

Ps:  Please re add Chongyun to the gacha feature, he is my favorite character!",5
This game is really fun and great I loved playing this and all of it wanders to discover . How I found a this game was a friend told me about it and I tried it and immediately loved it ! It amazing story line characters and atmosphere is just mouth dropping it graphic are to die for and you can even play in different language it welcomes all people from All around  the world it also great because you can play fun event by your self or with friends and you win items for doing so it very friendly and I love this game and encourage you to play this fun pack game of sad and happy storylines and a amazing world to unlock !,5
"Before I downloaded this game I was honestly clueless about what the whole deal was-I was seeing Fanart, fan vids, and just the glory of it‚Äôs fandom. So I downloaded the game, and I‚Äôm obsessed!! It‚Äôs an overall great game, the graphics are better then my eyesight, and the animations and voiceovers are amazing! I would 100% would recommend this to anyone who is a magic nerd like me, and really anyone who is curious! I love this game so much, but my only request is can we get an update where we can build relationships with other characters? Relationships such as friends, best friends, acquaintances, enemies, etc? Thank you!",5
Genshin impact is an amazing story game based on the twin falls asleep for 500 years and off to search for their other twin while making friends along the way to get closer to the truth about the abyss and such others making outlets all along the way and getting more stronger. Me personally really enjoys the storyline in with you anything and wait as long as it will take for it to complete completed but there is downsize especially for mobile players gentian impact takes a lot of storage for mobile players I wish the game editors will add a way to reduce the storage taking up so mobile players will be able to play longer like myself.‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è,4
Hoyoverse this is coming from a person who has been playing your game since March of 2021. Please add darkskin characters not tan not really light DARKSKIN i‚Äôm talking about a black person color you guys are embarrassing at this point because it‚Äôs not hard to add more skin tones to the game?? If you keep up with this no one will want to play your games anymore and you‚Äôll go bankrupt from the amount of money you would lose. Please hoyoverse if you don‚Äôt listen to your fan base how will you get more people to play your games?? do the right thing and don‚Äôt disappoint your fans any further. P.S i will also be attaching a picture of SKINTONES you should be using for sumeru characters and any other regions in the future based of off africa south asia etc. Please take this into consideration.,2
"Okay so my account got deleted but I have an alt so I sign in because I remember the password and since I‚Äôm on IOS now it‚Äôs a bit different for me. You need tons of free storage in order to even play the game which is obnoxious btw because my friend told me it took up 16 GB of there storage and I had 24 when I installed the game so the problem is I was on the demo and to install the full game they need more storage? I get that it‚Äôs fun but the fact that I might need to delete almost all my apps because of this one game is stupid. I might as well quit while I‚Äôm ahead because right now if this continues, there will only be pc players and some people will just quit the game too. They should also read the reviews too.",3
"So, I am a new Genshin impact player am I late yes very late but it doesn‚Äôt mean that I still don‚Äôt have time to catch up. To anyone who wants to be a new Genshin impact player know that you are not late and that you can always catch up, even if Genshin is on chapter 9 or whatever many chapters there‚Äôs going to be. But, anyway this game has been amazing I just got it last month and it‚Äôs amazing I like the fight withy stormterrer and the music was very good to!!!! P.S new players make sure to save your primojems your going to need them a lot ok trust you‚Äôll thank me later after you finally get the characters you want",5
Hoyoverse you NEED to put more diverse skin tones for characters in your game especially if they‚Äôre from regions that have darker toned characters like caramel color or dark honey something of those sorts just pls listen to us all of the community together thinks so we want you to change some of the characters skin colors to be a bit more TAN since they‚Äôre in a region inspired by those people in different shades and not every white person is paper white they have some shades too so pls release at least 1 tan character  every once in a while in the future given the game has a few years and it‚Äôs not looking so good if you keep showing ur racism pls listen to us,4
"Paimon just talks way too much‚Ä¶.AT THE BEGINNING, her voice was fine, but now it‚Äôs almost impossible to tolerate her shrieking voice lines, rants, and her ‚Äúelaborating‚Äù on topics that were already explained by the NPCs and characters in quests. Paimon also ruins the whole experience with her talking over the Traveler. Like CMON! The Traveler has a VA, but YALL don‚Äôt want he/she to voice any lines in the quests! So y‚Äôall better figure something out with Paimon DOMINATING OVER THE TRAVELER in VOICE LINES IN IMPORTANT STORY QUESTS. WE DONT WANT HER TO TALK OR ELABTORATE ON IMPORTANT STORY PROGRESSION!!! So either have the VA for the Traveler actually talk or tone down Paimon‚Äôs constant talking. If y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even try to fix these issues, I might as well leave this game for Tower of Fantasy or any other COMPETITORS that are similar to this game.",3
"Hey! This game is amazing but it‚Äôs laggy and the whole world is black when I play. I have to walk wherever I wanna see. And I have to guess where I‚Äôm walking. Other than that, this really is great, I just can‚Äôt get past a part. 2. I have heard people say graphics are better on pc but I don‚Äôt have one. I also heard my brother say this game would be on Nintendo switch soon but it still isn‚Äôt. If this is true, That‚Äôs great since I don‚Äôt have a PC but I really wanna play this game, it‚Äôs very fun!! - Ava (very rushed so it won‚Äôt make sense also I‚Äôm not very understanding of things so I don‚Äôt know how long it takes to have an app transfer to a different system)

[Edit]

Hello! It‚Äôs been possibly a year, and this game is ammmazzziiinnggg!! I‚Äôm obsessed with it and I play it all day everyday. I got a new device and now I can see (thankfully) Only, one minor note, it‚Äôs hard to get primogems and we don‚Äôt get characters often, plus the game is kinda p2w. Other than that I don‚Äôt really have much complaints. Thanks for your time!!

- Ava (again)",4
this game is great i will say it does take a lot of time that you must put into it and quests will get harder but that‚Äôs how you progress. This game has so much detail it‚Äôs unbelievable i started playing in July 2021 and i didn‚Äôt fully understand how to play the game so i never really played it but around January 2022 i started playing again i had watched many videos and Tiktoks about it and is quite fun time fly‚Äôs by playing that game. The only problem is that it does take money to get 5 star characters if you have average luck and it is not a free to play game but other then that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a great game!,5
"This game is full of amazing characters, beautiful settings and quality, addictive gameplay and attractive characters! But my main problems are the huge amounts of storage it takes on for mobile and how laggy it is/constant crashing, or adding in a late game player option where you are able to play minigames and co-op with others/friends in the minigames to entertain and help support late game, as late game is extremely boring and is often the cause of people quitting the game. Other than that, the game is astonishingly well made for a free game. Also, the music is OUTSTANDING!! Absolutely would reccomend.",5
"Let me explain what I mean by well set up gacha. They really take the whole ‚Äúgacha‚Äù aspect the max like never before. A whole 35 levels before you actually realize it‚Äôs a very gacha oriented game where you will have to spend money to do end game stuff, otherwise you will be grinding for years. And even if you do the end game bosses, that‚Äôs really all there is to this game after the quests is bossing. There‚Äôs no pvp to keep it fresh, no raids, no losing your items if you die. Nothing exciting once you get past the flashy combat and first 35 levels. This company is very clever, they‚Äôre also trying to drag the main story out for years to come to make you feel like it‚Äôs more than just a gacha game and that it‚Äôs really building toward something. If you like bossing only, I highly recommend playing Monster Hunter instead.",1
"This game is very very fun and very enjoyable. It has a very good story line, etc. I don‚Äôt even think I can finish explaining how fun this game in this review only, becuase of how good it is. But the only thing that I HATE is the primogem economy and the wishing system. 160 primogem equals one wish and you have to at least wish 70 times not even 90 to get a 5 star. I also hate how the stardust and other shops reset monthly like come on, that‚Äôs so much for so little. In updates they at least give us 300 primogems which is not even 2 wishes. They barely give us any primogems whatsoever through the seasons\banners. The primogem economy and the wishing system and everything related to that needs fixing.",4
"Amazing game! outstanding graphics and gameplay! the plot is usually thrilling and keeps players like myself amused and entertained. Some of the story quest could use some work, but overall amazing side stories for each of the 5* characters. The anniversary started off rough, with the lack of communication with the playerbase with their disappointment with the rewards, however, they are making amendments currently with rewards, that many players like myself hope to continue to for players to feel truly appreciated for their year long unprecedented support in the gacha industry. Great game, looking forward to Kazuha rerun.",5
"Honestly I think this game is a wonderful masterpiece, it has great graphics (but the mobile version is pretty laggy but you can‚Äôt blame them the graphics are just too much for your device), great combat, an interesting story line and wonderful events I would recommend this game to anyone who is kinda sketchy about the game because at first I thought this was a little too good to be true but when I finally decided to download it was better that I imagined  in conclusion, I definitely recommend this game to anyone interested. (Btw don‚Äôt really recommend mobile it‚Äôs still good but pretty laggy).",5
"Come on Mihoyo I just wanted a free Keqing is that too much to ask?

Also I Win To Lose (youtuber) did the math and Mihoyo would lose around 17k from the web events (where you submit art or cosplay or smth)

And I did the math (with a few assumptions here and there) and giving out a free 5* would lose Mihoyo near nothing:

1. Let‚Äôs say Mihoyo have a free 5* and someone picked Mona because they don‚Äôt have her. This would save that person from wishing on a hypothetical Mona banner that could happen one day (similar to the Keqing banner in 1.3) because even if I chose Mona then, I‚Äôd still lose the 50/50 and still maybe get Mona.

2. If they did this, this would reduce sales on a future Keqing, Jean, Diluc, Mona, or Qiqi banner. However, the Keqing banner back in 1.3 sold terribly and was meant as a filler banner due to cultural reasons and likely wouldn‚Äôt happen again anyways.

3. The Keqing banner sold less than 1 million in China I think (which is the only region Mihoyo cares about). This means Mihoyo would lose near nothing in the grand scheme of things since they‚Äôre a billionaire company by now.

So Mihoyo please just give me a free Keqing that‚Äôs all I ask.

Also if there‚Äôs anything left to trust in the Mihoyo company it‚Äôs Yu-Peng Chen to produce absolute fire tracks",1
"One of the most successful gacha games thanks to its fans who, in turn, are shown zero appreciation on its own anniversary and are exploited for works of art and other promotions for crumbs and pennies instead. 

Aside from very greedy business practices, the game itself and experience could be so much more. While very fun in the beginning and full of charming characters, you will start noticing the tedious grind, lack of multiplayer features, and poor mechanics that guilt you for skipping a day of play. Eventually, you‚Äôll come to a point and ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat am I doing this for?‚Äù 

Be careful of how much money and time you invest into this game. It‚Äôs a gacha game in the end, and it will entice you to give more and more. As a long time player since October 2020, it‚Äôs a love hate experience at the moment. I‚Äôd recommend new players to pass on this game.",1
"This is one of the best free games I‚Äôve played in a long time, the scenery and the voice lines are really well made. I can appreciate all the time and effort that was put into it and the best part is you can still get and have really good characters and weapons without having to spend money. The game still gives you the resources to be able to try and get the characters and weapons you want, albeit not guaranteed, it‚Äôs still fun and challenging. Spending money for the chance to get certain characters and weapons are OPTIONAL if you really want it. Recommend this game to anyone and everyone!",5
"I was so excited when I started playing Genshin. The art is incredible, the stories are engaging, and the characters are lovable. However, I‚Äôm extremely dissatisfied with the pricing and wishing system. You have to pay for a CHANCE to get a character you want. Call me crazy, but if I‚Äôm spending real money I want to actually get that character. You can‚Äôt get anything good from one single wish and that alone costs about $3. Usually, to get a five star character you have to do about 20 wishes, which will cost you about $60. Oh, but remember, you might not actually get the character you want. So essentially, you‚Äôre just gambling. My advice if you want to play the game? Don‚Äôt give them a single cent, stay free to play. If you pay, you‚Äôre wasting money.",2
By far the most visually stunning game that is available for mobile gaming. The elegant user interface allows for seamless transitions of character skill combinations; Genshin Impact is in a class all its own without a shadow of a doubt! If I had any suggestions as for improvement for gameplay I would consider asking the developers to take a look at the animations during the boss battle Dvalin. I‚Äôve noticed my character while switching platforms will tend to fall off the edge of the cutscene occurs during the swap. However even this is not enough to keep me away! Keep up the amazing work! ‚Ä¢‡•êM¬•HM‡•ê‚Ä¢,5
"So, I was really interested in seeing this game after hearing about it so many times and the acclaim it has gotten. After registering and logging in, I tried to start playing in the America server when a pop-up‚Ä¶popped up and told me if I want to download the full game. Of course, I was fine with a little wait, and said yes. However, when I tried to let it download, it said I had ‚Äúinsufficient storage space.‚Äù So, I decided to try closing it out and trying again, still nothing. Then I checked my storage space to see I have barely used any storage space, so I knew it wasn‚Äôt a problem with my iPad. Unfortunately, until it gets fixed or I figure out how to fix it myself, I am completely unable to play this game. If it gets fixed, I have hopes; for now though, I will just leave it for now.",1
"Please remive the resin cap! It will allow us to play game for longer time! There cannot be a time we will be bored by this amazing game because there‚Äôs so much to do! Its difficult to get those perfect sub stat artifacts to enjoy & experiment with different characters. But if the resin cap is removed i might end us farming for all the resources to max out every weapon, character, talent there is in the game to see its max potential! Its easier for whales (they definitely earn it, no offense against them) but the F2P experience leaves me feeling to stop playing this game. I could certainly go for monthly pass regularly if resin cap is removed! Pls do so & trust me you‚Äôll win all the possible rewards out there!",4
"TL;DR at the bottom. The story and characters are rich, the world vast and wonderful, and hidden gems are plentiful until level 30 where it suddenly becomes a constant grind. And this grind is not a finite one as one might believe, an entire week will get you next to nowhere unless you're willing to pay, gacha game and all that. To be quite frank, the game is amazing and then falls flat on it's face, confronting you with a Sisyphean task just to get the next bit of story, and that's not even mentioning the tens of hours one would have to put in to ascend (rank up, different from a level up) a single character once. TL;DR: Great game of near AAA quality if you love to grind or pay to win, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.",3
"i recently downloaded it and im already on adventure rank 22!! my friend kept bugging me to get it so i finally gave in, and it was the best decision of my life. i love every character design and the GRAPHICS!!! they really paid close attention to detail, even the tiniest of ones! i love this game so much. its a way to escape to a fantasy world filled with elements, anemo, and fighting. i also really like it because there is always something to do, wether its commissions, quests, or just fighting all the interesting characters. ahhh! i just love this game so much! if you are into rpgs, fantasy, elements, and getting into high stakes combat, then this is the PERFECT game for you! get it get it get it!",5
"I‚Äôm super excited for the switch release whenever it happens so I can use a controller to play this great game. So far from what I‚Äôve experienced it‚Äôs been a lot of fun and I‚Äôm looking forward to see what else the game has in store. There are a few things that could be improved, however:

1. I don‚Äôt know what it is but the camera on mobile is really weird. It would be great if the camera was sort of soft-locked to a perspective that followed the character‚Äôs movements a bit more because sometimes you‚Äôll get swarmed by enemies but the camera is locked to an awkward position making it hard to see. No doubt camera controls work better on PC or console but it‚Äôs definitely troublesome on mobile.

2. Obstacles remain opaque when they block the camera‚Äôs view. I‚Äôll be in the middle of fighting a boss creature and accidentally run under a tree and now I can‚Äôt see anything but the top of the tree. 

Hopefully some of the issues can be resolved to raise the game‚Äôs standard of living a bit.

***Edit: really frustrating that melee characters have no way to attack aerial enemies :/",4
As you probably know I have already written one review before and I‚Äôm writing another just so the developers can be notified about this problem and I‚Äôm not trying to complain this is a great game and it would be one of my favorites if not for one particular defect in the game when you play on tablet and I have tried this game on multiple tablets so I can assure you this is an actual defect but it makes you leave the game and go to your home screen and this defect or glitch has gotten so bad to the point that I can‚Äôt even play the game anymore so if your planning on getting this game on your tablet it‚Äôs not a good idea and this last note is for the developers please fix this defect I really like this game and want to eventually be able to play it again.,3
"I normally don‚Äôt do reviews but this game is top notch. I am on phone so sorry if i have typos but this game has beautiful graphics along with that an amazing story mode, as well as solo and multiplayer. Even on top of that there is a manga for it. I was going throughout the website to see if there was anything new coming and it seems that there is going to be a new huge thing coming. To the people who made this game  you guys are beyond skilled and have shown me that there are hope on mobile games. And the fact that you made a game that actually makes me more excited and interested about what happens next. Love the game and keep up the great worküëç",5
"This game is awesome... but a few tweaks could happen. When you are required to climb your first wall 5 mins into the game... I learned how to noclip, yea fix that ASAP. Secondly the flight speed could be raised since the larger rivers can not be flown over, not a huge speed increase but a mild one could suffice. The third problem is when fighting the wind elemental to unlock the left-most tower, you can glitch a spot to where the wind-protector is stuck in its own trap and will die in under a minute. Lastly the game will crash often, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because the game just recently launched but I‚Äôve noticed that it will only do it when entering a new area.",5
"Now, I love this game and it‚Äôs amazing but I have a slight problem with the massive downloads that happen every time I play. This may be an unfixable problem but I‚Äôm just throwing my problems out there (don‚Äôt come for me lol). Whenever I play I always have to download a huge download. One time, a download took me over 8 hours. In my opinion, that is ridiculous. (Yes I know this game has lots of details and stuff but I‚Äôm just saying). I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an issue on my part but if there‚Äôs a way to fix this then I would like to know! (I play on mobile and have literally no iCloud storage so that may be the problem)",4
"i tried playing this game. It‚Äôs works pretty well I experienced no lags, and it was occasionally fun. Overall I feel this is a overrated pay to win, and sometimes the game gets confusing. It‚Äôs very boring honestly and i constantly found myself feeling burdened by the game itself while playing. It came to the point where after 2 weeks of on and off playing it just sat on my phone collecting dust. Does not help how problematic the company behind this is, and how I ended feeling actually embarrassed to be playing this game. Also, all of the playable kid  characters had iffy designs teeter tottering on lolibait, but I guess if you‚Äôre not a pedo it doesn‚Äôt really affect you lol. Overall a pretty mundane game that I personally wouldn‚Äôt suggest to anyone. It may just be my taste tho.",2
I usually can‚Äôt stand the games with the hyper sexualized anime waifu characters but I‚Äôve been finding myself able to overlook it. The world design is beautiful. The gameplay is like a AAA quality game with the freedom of BOTW and immersive feeling like Elder Scrolls. I‚Äôm excited with the new biomes that will be accessible soon (especially a harsh fridged like snezhnaya). This seems like a game you can pick up and play whenever for years. My only complaints right now are it‚Äôs 20gb of space in your phone and will probably continue to eat up space and adventure rank locking you out of tasks.,5
"The game is good and it‚Äôs got a good concept, good gameplay and so so many things to do. My issue is with the characters. Genshin Impact has a mashup of different cultures which is pretty good IF they had a larger variety of skin tones. The characters all seem to have a pale skin tone, with the exception of Kaeya and Xinyan. It‚Äôs nice having all these cultures in the game but it‚Äôd be appreciated if there were more skin tones and characters that had more melanin, you know? Other than that it‚Äôs nice to play, build and collect characters and make new friends!! I think I speak for most of the Genshin players when we say we would like some more diversity and variety in skin tones :)",4
"I started in February during school, when I had nothing to do. This game I tell you saved me from boredom and everything in between. I immediately got addicted and didn‚Äôt feel ashamed. I‚Äôve been playing probably everyday ever since and have enjoyed every minute! I love the story line, characters (except Venti, personal opinion), and the art/setting. It is all so peaceful so when I tell you I‚Äôm excited for the new updates (especially Sumeru and characters) I AM EXCITED! I HIGHLY recommend this game to anybody who is VERY bored and love games with story‚Äôs, action, and gameplay characters with personality! <3",5
"Genshin impact is and amazing game but I recently deleted and quit the game because in order to progress or play the game to the full potential you have to worship the statues in the game and if you go on with the game without doing that you will be faced with another problem they have quite revealing clothes on the females. It has mention of Gods and you use they power the give you to defat monsters or cook, puzzles and much more, It has amazing graphics and I liked the game a lot but those things  went against Islam and made it haram to play such as worshiping statues and the gacha system being gambling if you used real moneyI would recommend not playing so you don‚Äôt get addicted but this is my opinion only other then that it‚Äôs a great game!",2
"Hi I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact for around a month now and I have been enjoying it a lot. There are a few tricky things here and there but the thing that makes this feel so p2w is that right now I‚Äôm doing inazuma archon quest, where you have to attack the fatui. My problem is that I only have four stars with some only being lvl 40 which isn‚Äôt good, the bad thing is that since they‚Äôre the only characters I can use it‚Äôs hard to do quest like this one since the fatui KEEP HEALING THEMSELVES WHEN YOU BREAK THEIR SHEILD. My characters may be lower leveled but I‚Äôm f2p so I can‚Äôt do anything about it so for now try doing something to nerf them for low level people!",4
"ok this is just a suggestion I wanna make, maybe you could add different systems, like trading systems for example, some people are WAY too impatient sometimes when their saving and feel like wasting it all, and yea, and maybe even a duel system where you could duel with other players,and maybe get primogems from it,I just wanted to write cause I‚Äôm one of the impatient players and it‚Äôs hard for me to save without the person I‚Äôm waiting for to be on the next banner and I also think paimon‚Äôs shop takes way too long, maybe like 2 or 3 weeks. That‚Äôs all I have to say, thank you.",5
"I‚Äôm just going to give it to u straight, it‚Äôs a really fun game and u can get addicted to it very easily, gameplay is great, it also has a bit of fan service, the characters are pretty/handsome, but there is a problem ones your done with most things you‚Äôll stop playing and then when there‚Äôs a new character that u want you won‚Äôt have enough of anything materials mora primogems so it‚Äôs ether use money or farm and wait for a re-run meanwhile there will be other cool characters that u want, this is the last thing after some quests you‚Äôll have nothing to do besides farm and ngl it‚Äôs very boring.",5
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Genshin Impact so much it is k e of my favorite games but‚Ä¶ To get characters you want could take months and most of the time is not guaranteed. Second it is really hard for new players since all the banners and new characters coming out are region locked to were new players can‚Äôt get the stuff to ascend making new units which are really good pointless early game. Third okay let‚Äôs be honest here they don‚Äôt look at feedback do they. Over all the game is amazing I like the characters and story and over all map but these are just a few problems I find! Have a nice day! <3,5
"Genshin Impact is one of my favorite games to date. The graphics are amazing, while tolling considering how much storage and performance they require, the characters are often loveable and well designed, and the gameplay is fun and expansive. However, there‚Äôs so many flaws to count. The company is neglectful, certain characters are hardly usable and aren‚Äôt fixed, the rewards are bluntly bad, and the gacha system is a money grab. There are many more I haven‚Äôt mentioned that just didn‚Äôt come to mind. If you‚Äôre free to play, good luck, and if you‚Äôre a spender, I hope you are sure of your expenses, because this game seems like a scam way too much.",4
"Genshin Impact is really fun. It‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôm addicted to it. The characters are attractive, everything, everything about this game is perfect. So, this evening, a problem happened. When I went into the game, I didn‚Äôt let me in. It kept saying that my internet connection isn‚Äôt working. It didn‚Äôt let me in the game. My internet connection was working completely fine with other apps. I went to check my internet, it was fine. But it won‚Äôt let me get into Genshin Impact. I‚Äôve tried restarting my iPad, but still Genshin Impact isn‚Äôt working. Please fix the problem quickly. I would rate this game 5 stars if this hadn‚Äôt happened. Good luck to creators. I hope you all have a good day.",3
"The game is amazing quality and the story is well written and never ceases to impress and amaze me. And the best part is it‚Äôs completely free to play and ad free too! I‚Äôve never had to stop to watch some 30 second ad to continue playing. The only money I have ever invested was because I wanted to, but you can easily do everything you need to for free with just some time and a little bit of effort. Primogems aren‚Äôt that hard to earn and they roll out events fairly often that usually include them as a reward. All in all an amazing game that‚Äôs well worth your time!",5
"Alright so if your looking for an open world role play game then this is the perfect game for you, from the voice acting to the amazing character designs and cities this game is amazing. I would totally recommend this game even if you don‚Äôt like to role play, you would just fall straight into the gacha part of the game, the gacha banners always have great characters that you would really want.
The people that you can meet in this game are great and the rewards you can earn are even better, the game teaches you teamwork and lets you reach out too friends and family who want to play the game.",5
I have been playing this game since release and it has made a huge difference in my life so when i saw the one year anniversary coming up i got excited and happy so see what kind of rewards and activities mihoyo would put in the game. Spoilers i was very disappointed when i saw there tweet of what the rewards were i was very underwhelmed. I truly expected more from this company that we game millions of dollars too. It would not hurt the company at all to even just give us a free standard five star. When the community started giving feed back on the subject the company deleted their anniversary post but did not change anything. Over i can speak for almost everyone on this when i say we are very disappointed in these rewards and in the company and we hope that mihoyo can do better in that future.,1
"Game file size is ridiculous. The cut scenes would be cool if they didn‚Äôt clip and buffer. The music will play and the cut scenes will buffer, so you miss parts of cut scenes. This game doesn‚Äôt play without an excellent wifi connection. I have decent internet and the game just feels one packet away from a crash at every single moment. The recent 2 gig update has me sick of trying with this garbage. They had to pay for their reviews because the quality I experienced was trash at best. I‚Äôm sorry, you might love this game. I hate it and I wanted to love it. If the game is going to be 10 gigs worth the hard drive space, it better run smooth without needing cellular service. It‚Äôs massive, clunky, unpolished, and repetitive. Don‚Äôt waste your money weebs there are better games out there.

Hey Apple stop taking checks and pencil whipping reviews. This is unsatisfactory.",1
"I love the game with all my heart, I've been playing on it for 7 months directly non stop. The story and the lore has completly captured my attention. The problem is I chose the wrong server and i play on mobile. Which leads to me constantly crashing. Before Inazuma came out the amount of times I crashed was fine, it was tolerable. But after inazuma came out I can't even check my inventory or teleport or use my skills without crashing, even when I'm simply chopping trees for materials I crash. and then i did the second part of the inazuma archon quest and now i crash non stop. Its so annoying and it makes me patience run thin. Please fix the issue of constantly crashing.",3
"This game super fun, amazing graphics, interesting story, engaging gameplay and a beautiful expansive world. Unfortunately that‚Äôs all i can really say about it, as I haven‚Äôt been able to play the game beyond the trial on mobile, and haven‚Äôt been able to play for a while on the pc, once it needed an update i was unable to provide the storage space needed to play, and I haven‚Äôt been able to resolve the problem. Ive tried various things but it seems that my computer just cant handle the game. I realize that this is more a problem with my own setup, but i just wanted to write this review to let people know that you might not be able to play if you dont have a serious computer or device",3
"So if i turn out my opinion on to the internet and some mother or father (I don‚Äôt discriminate) will come in searching to see if their child may or may not play this game.

When playing this game I have noticed a heavy amount of graphics (how the game looks) and it will need more storage- along with WiFi space. If you use a lot of WiFi then as a family then I should suggest keeping graphics on low if you choose to download the game.

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF ITS APPROPRIATE:
It probably is- the only thing I might add is that the things characters wear can be quite. . . Visual. (See: Mona) Nothing ever SHOWS of course. Every so often in the storylines as well characters will joke about drinks and some times ‚Äúget drunk‚Äù (it‚Äôs never actually seen as it the voice actor only does a few hiccups to symbolize it) 

Over all the story line is 100% appropriate, the graphics are heavy so be warned, and then finally the characters show a little skin. That‚Äôs all :D",5
"So I wanted to play a amine game I found this app but when I downloaded it it said I didn‚Äôt have enough space even I didn‚Äôt have that much apps so I deleted 1 app and it was downloading and it wanted me to sign in/up and I did but it said incorrect even I did it right I deleted it after after a few days it came back but I didn‚Äôt even download it again but after that I deleted it again and after another 3 weeks it came back again so I decided cancel download instead of pressing the x it and didn‚Äôt come back after I kept getting notifications from this app every single time it was on my phone so if u want this app to haunt ur phone u might as well don‚Äôt download it. ‚ú®Big Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ú® If you want our phone to have less storage do not download this app. This app is like Talking Angela, Talking Tom, and Talking Ginger.",1
"So I just got this game today and I really enjoy it like it‚Äôs really fun because me and my other friends we play it and I‚Äôm like oh this is fun. But here‚Äôs the thing I play on mobile and like, let‚Äôs just say the downloading thing takes way too long and I would really love to know how to cancel it because I want to cancel the download and just go back to normal play because unless I cancel the download that‚Äôs when I can go back to the game but I can‚Äôt cancel download download so I cannot get back to the game I would love for someone to help me because this is kind of getting out of hand. But overall this is so impressive and a great game not to mention it‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs just over the top amazing great job!",4
"When it started it sounded super glitchy and was using everything my phone had to run it. It‚Äôs an amazing game and I actually play it on my pc but it‚Äôs definitely not for mobile devices. I don‚Äôt know if my phone just can‚Äôt handle the game and if other ones can but it didn‚Äôt work for me on my phone. Really great game though I always play it and it‚Äôs so addicting! There‚Äôs so much to do and it‚Äôs really fun playing with other players. Pretty much the anime version of Breath of the Wild, but it‚Äôs still super good and the graphics are really great. Definitely recommend this game! üò∫",5
"SPOILERS!! I adore this game it‚Äôs absolutely wonderful. I play it daily and I have gotten really far in the story. But once I fished the boss battle against Childe the cutscene started to glitch out. This wasn‚Äôt the first time as the big cutscenes always glitch out in me. So I just restarted my game so it could hopefully load a bit better. Worked the last time I did it. But this time it worked at first, kept glitching so another restart. And it‚Äôs reaction was not give me back my items I used during the fight and I got sent back to the begging! Even after I got the achievement!! As much as I love this game I really don‚Äôt wish to redo the entire boss fight again. My accounts name is LucyMaka on the European server if it helps.",4
"... it‚Äôs hard to navigate with a black screen.

Now, let me be clear. I love, love, love the set up of this game and I‚Äôm having a blast with the open world play. It‚Äôs not overly complex and I like the random side quests that pop up. The cooking feature is  fun too.

I can navigate about 1/2 the map with a spotlight surrounding the character, which works fine most of the time. And even when the screen goes completely black (aside from the controls) it isn‚Äôt impossible to move around provided you‚Äôve unlocked the map for that area. Which is ALSO possible to do with a black screen lol. The rain seems to trigger it in Liyue and surrounding areas.

However completing certain quests are nigh impossible. The Gliding Test and Stormterrors Lair: Empty Abode have ground my gameplay to a near stop. Since I can‚Äôt make any leeway on those I‚Äôve just been focusing on level grinding, which isn‚Äôt nearly as satisfying.

The only place I‚Äôve found that shows the full sky is near the Cryo Regisvine, south-east of the Temple of Wolf. Which is quite lucky really, because the view is lovely.",4
"This game really is addicting, even if you are a free to play player. The consistent quests/grinding and the imagination of what you can do with the characters is endless! It really keeps the player engaged. This is hands down, one of the best games of 2020. The characters all have their unique personalities and backgrounds, it‚Äôs an open world that involves co-op, which also involves npc shops! Though the co-op isn‚Äôt necessarily beating the campaign with others, but beating the side quests others. Looking past that, I really enjoy this game and if I could spend money on this game, I definitely would. I look forward to all of the features and events that miHoYo gives us!",5
"It‚Äôd be essay material to go into detail how how horrible this game is once past the honeymoon phase of early exploration and levels so instead short and concise. 
Minimal gameplay with gated resin (stamina) that refreshes slowly. The plus 40 to the cap does nothing except change time to cap resin from 16h to 20 hours. 
So much tied to this resin currency that even if you have luck in the rng Gatcha element, you need to use all you have to have them be mediocre on your team. Or just pay more money. Also pay money to roll another rng element of artifacts. Just roll roll roll and open those wallets! 
But yeah, could also just dedicate a months worth of log in dailies use up resin and repeat to get one character leveled and geared.  Considering there‚Äôs what? 24 characters? Guess you got two years of content to do on repeat then! 
Wasted potential.",1
"This game is full! Of jaw dropping action, amazing world, and a great game to play. I have play all the mihoyo games (honkai impacts 3rd) and was just waiting for this to come for so long, and when it came I fell in love with the game immediately, but I give it 4 stars so far is because every time I get into it, there is a black area in a 12 feet radius of my character, and I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs in front of me and that‚Äôs what I was hoping for in this game, to see the landscape. I know it‚Äôs early access and game has not fully developed yet but when I see others playing it it has no black screen anywhere, I do not know what is wrong with mine but I hope it gets fixed as soon as possible so that I can play more of it.",4
"I honestly expected this game to be like every other RPG on the app store--boring and money hungry--but I was pleased surprised with this one. It is very fair to free players and the story as well as the characters are so interesting and engaging. I can see myself playing this for a LONG time. EDIT‚Äî So I've had this game for a week or so and I LOVE it! The storyline is still captivating and it keeps you wanting to keep at the leveling grind. The scenery is breathtaking as well as diverse. It seems that they're going to add more areas as the game grows. Sure, it overheats my phone a bit after gaming for a while but I would say it is very much worth it.",5
"This game is absolutely phenomenal, let me start off with one suggestion, after this one critique, the latter will all be on a positive note. I think there absolutely needs to be a deeper customization with character. A wardrobe, hair, body sizes, height, eye color, maybe mounts, etc. That would improve its immersion 10 fold.

Now that I have made my one and only suggestion, I can start to tell my true, transparent, deep love for this game so far.  I have played it every day since it‚Äôs release. If anyone is looking for a fulfilling game that will keep you up until 3 am, this is it right here. Don‚Äôt think about it, don‚Äôt hesitate. Just download it, you will not regret it.",5
"This game is very well put together and I can play this for hours and enjoy every minute but my one small problem that kept this from being 5 stars is that your rewards system is very poor and unsatisfying, that fact that I play for hours and it takes lots of grinding to level up you Adventure Rank which that I have no problem with but the constant and repetitive Greens and Blue at are always the same items I get is very boring. If the drop rate can be changed just by a bit that would make grinding a bit more enjoyable. 

Ps: also in multiplayer I can‚Äôt interact with anything or anyone when playing in anothers worlds, if this is a bug please fix this issue.",4
"I started playing this on my pc and laptop, and that works great. But I recently got the new iPhone 13 expecting that I would have enough storage to download Genshin. But no, I my family ended up buying 200 GB of storage due to needing more storage themselves, but it also put it on mine. What I‚Äôm trying to say here is if you are planning on downloading Genshin on your phone, 5GB of storage isn‚Äôt going to work, and deleting everything off your phone isn‚Äôt worth that. Plan ahead and try and upgrade your storage to 60 GB for $1 a month depending on what phone plan you have. Other that than it‚Äôs such a great game.",4
If the game maybe had character customization to like the change the hair clothes it would be really fun but overall this game is the best I have been looking for a long time for a game like this you guys have me write a review because how good it is and i don‚Äôt know if this is your first project but it‚Äôs the best. This was worth the wait because all the time all of the games are disappointing but this one didn‚Äôt make disappointed and you guys should never give up on this game. And Finally like I said if you guys want add character customization no matter how long it takes like a year I‚Äôll wait for that or more.,5
"All of the time I get to see my favourite content creators, friends, and others get to play this game so I decided to download it. making a account was easy but before I could load into the game I had gotten a notification on my screen.  ""Not enough storage space!"" I had read on my screen. I tried first by deleting my photos. Then I deleted my apps, Then i deleted almost EVERYTHING. On my device (iPad) BUT IT STILL WONT LOAD! I was very disappointed and let down that this wasn't working. At last All i have is this game on my iPad that I cant even use because I ""don't have enough storage space"" I wouldn't recommend this only because I cant even use it. If only I could fix this problem. I'm sure the game is good but I can't even play it.",2
"i love genshin so much. i‚Äôve been playing since august of 2020 and it has been a blast. i‚Äôve definitely fallen out of it several times, but that is because of my busy schedule and not because the game is boring. most of the characters (especially female) are very stereotypical but they‚Äôre all quite interesting in their own ways. i do wish there was some variety (they have like three female base models for both npcs and playable characters), like maybe plus-size women or women with more proportionate sizing. despite all this, the characters‚Äô body types do not take away from the incredible gameplay. i do hope that hoyoverse/mihoyo adds a better primogem/gacha experience, as it is very hard to farm for primogems sometimes. i also hope that, in future lands, the chests have some variety and are not all common. i feel like since inazuma came out, mihoyo has limited the contents of chests by a lot. i do still love the game, despite its small annoyances. play genshin!",5
"ive been playing genshin since release, played for an entire year but then took breaks inbetween for about 1-3 months(?). it got repetitive and boring since i kinda feel like the story isn't going anywhere and the event/content isn't really progressive. the events are kinda repetitive and similar to the old ones, so it's pretty boring for an old player. there isn't anything that's NEW NEW. not only that, it's so difficult getting primogems as well. i feel like genshin is turning into ""play to win"" now. not only that, since genshins regions are gigantic, and how much you'll have to farm and explore to catch up with the og players if you're new.. tbh i feel like genshins time has run out, everything's kinda repetitive and boring now, esp if you're f2p.",2
"Genshin Impact is is a beautiful, breathtaking, and addicting game. It's so addictive that I sometimes have to stop myself from playing before I get burnt out. The graphics are amazing, and the character designs are always unique from each other with every little detail. The storyline is really interesting which pushes me to keep on playing, and the gameplay (along with building characters) is absolutely great. Very update I feel excited for whatever's new to come, and I can't wait to see what Genshin has in store for us throughout all of the regions. Thank you for this wonderful game, Hoyoverse.",5
"I was a player since 1.1, stopped around 2.9. The game just took a turn for the worst around 2.5. The characters felt more sloppy and for players who are AR 55 and above it starts to get boring. Less and less story and more and more grinding. This grinding starts to feel like a chore, or homework that‚Äôs so hard you just want to rage quit. It‚Äôs so difficult to get one single wish. MIHOYO is extremely stingy with the primogems (I won‚Äôt bring up that 1 year anniversary, but know it was probably the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen.) and at this point, they are stingy with content too. These characters are starting to feel less like characters with actual kits and then constellations as buffs and more like characters who were released half down with constellations as the rest of their kit.",1
"I got Genshin in October 2021, a few months after the Inazuma release. It‚Äôs saved me from tons of boredom and I was pulled into the black hole almost immediately. The graphics and design are absolutely amazing and the storyline is even better. The only thing I have to say, like a lot of other people are saying, is Hoyoverse needs to add a little diversity in the character‚Äôs skin tones. Even before the Sumeru ‚Äòleaks‚Äô (I‚Äôm not entirely sure if some of them were legit), I was noticing that only two, if not one, of the characters had darker skin tones. Other than that I absolutely love the game and highly recommend!!",5
I‚Äôve been playing Genshin sense the game was first released! I instantly fell in love with it. I play it everyday when I can! I rember when the company was just called mihoyo starting out but then branched out with a new name called hoyoverse. Saying they wanted to change their name to help cater to diversity and equality in the game. But so far I haven‚Äôt been seeing said diversity. It‚Äôs sad seeing such a wonderful game take inspiration from middle eastern and south Asian culture. But with that there is an expectation with diversity in their characters which has not been show whatsoever. There are a total of 2 dark skinned characters out of a roaster of 50 characters. And that not acceptable. And that makes me scared to see what natlan is going to be like seeing how it‚Äôs supposed to take inspiration from Hispanic and Mayan/Aztec culture. I hope hoyoverse will one day fix this issue.,1
"I love this game, it‚Äôs a shame that even after offloading/deleting my entire phone for this app it still doesn‚Äôt have enough storage to download my previously saved data. Not to mention that even when I was able to play the graphics were pretty crappy compared to pc devices. It crashed every time I wanted to co-op domain or wish, saves my progress but still pretty annoying especially during co-op where it leaves people confused. This app leavesmy phone super hot after and during playing even when I currently can‚Äôt because of storage. All in all, don‚Äôt get this app if you‚Äôre a mobile player great game for awhile but not worth it because eventually you‚Äôre going to run out of storage with the seemingly endless updates.",2
I have been playing for almost a year now and I quite and enjoy playing. There are a few things that I personally think should be dealt with. I‚Äôm a mobile player and updating the game take at the fastest an hour. Also when updating for the app store it has MULTIPLE updates needing to be dealt with the first time it happened I had to wait around a week for them all to be finished the to bombarded by more updates inside the game. Other than updating the game the lore and character designs are absolutely stunning. I‚Äôm F2P and I have collected quite a few amazing units and am enjoying the game play :),4
"I absolutely love Genshin impact, but the amount of storage that it takes is unacceptable. I deleted everything until I was left with WhatsApp and the native apps, even the native apps that I did not use I deleted and I still didn‚Äôt have enough storage! When I was left with the undeleteables I tried to summon the devil to somehow grant me more storage on my phone, but alas he himself could not grant me enough storage to download the full version of Genshin. I have played the game before and it is by far the best game available on the App Store. If it wasn‚Äôt because I have played it before, and adored it very much I would have gave the game two stars.",4
"This game is so fun to play, I love the events and exploring the open world to level up my characters. It's so fun that I put up with the constant crashes, though sometimes I get so tired of the crashing that I have to take a break. I know this game is intended for console or PC, but if they made it available to mobile, they should make sure it's compatible beforehand. Oftentimes I do one thing like change my party, and I know I'll have to restart the game because it will crash. It's ridiculous how often the game crashes, I'm really hoping they solve this soon, but for now the game is fun enough that I endure restarting it every 3 minutes.",4
"I love genshin impact, I‚Äôve been playing since ganyu‚Äôs first banner last January and have spent a good amount of money on this game. I did however begin playing on my phone, my first login was on my phone. Meaning that even tho I play basically only on my pc I am still required to buy genesis crystals on my phone. It‚Äôs such a hinderance to only have genshin on my phone just to spend money. I don‚Äôt understand and it is extremely frustrating because it takes so much storage to update and have genshin on your phone. I really hope they change this because it really upsets me that this is a problem. I can only rate it 3 stars because of how inconvenient this is.",3
It was a pretty good game for the month that I had it but in that time I played all I could on the demo. In the short time I had the game I managed to play the whole demo before it told me I played all I could on the demo and I have a friend who‚Äôs also played the demo and downloaded the full version and said it ‚Äúkilled‚Äù her storage I noticed not long after I installed it I had little storage left and installing the whole thing would leave me with very little if any storage left. But I would definitely recommend this game to others.,5
"By far the best game I‚Äôve ever seen available on mobile and also one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played period. It is a true open world and you will get pretty absorbed in the gameplay. The soundtrack is also so beautiful. The story is not even close to being done so I know I‚Äôll be playing this game for a few years to come. The developers keep the game fun and exciting by introducing new areas, events, and characters. Highly recommend. Just be careful you don‚Äôt get sucked too far into the gacha system or you will end up spending more money than you anticipated.",5
"Honestly I love this game so much. I‚Äôve been playing for at least 6 hours a day but I do have one problem. It crashes far too often. It‚Äôs quite annoying when you‚Äôre fighting and it crashes and you have to restart. It crashes at least 4 times an hour for me and I don‚Äôt know what to do with it so please fix this miHoYo. (Also I find it quite hard to find primo gems so- üòè)

Edit: It‚Äôs been a year since the game was officially released, so I was expecting some rewards, but as this is all related to marketing and what not I guess that was to be expected. Happy 1 year anniversary Genshin!",5
"this game is incredible, the story and characters are all very well done. BUT, mihoyo is a greedy company. this game has been out for a year as of me writing this and the anniversary rewards are awful. for those who don‚Äôt know, you have to enter an art raffle (where you make your own art) with a 10% chance of winning 100 primos (the currency for gatcha used in the game) this isn‚Äôt even enough for 1 pull. mihoyo has been doing this for months and i‚Äôm so fed up. after playing this game for nearly a year, I feel as if the company doesn‚Äôt see its player base as people who love their game but rather a way to make money and free promo off of. mihoyo needs to do better, think twice before getting this game.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, spent over $1k, missed only 5 days of playing since release, only to be rewarded with nothing. I love, love, LOVE this game! It‚Äôs my absolute favorite- which is why it‚Äôs hard for me to write this. The developers of this game have earned SO much money and support from Genshin Impact and yet they treat the players horribly! Other gacha games offer daily login rewards that offer lots of pulls and yet we only get 60 primos from commissions? Not to mention the resin system! I can‚Äôt even play anymore without having to spend primos to refresh resin. Mihoyo is a greedy company and I‚Äôm close to giving up the game, though hopefully with all the community outcry they will change.",3
"Ok so there‚Äôs a couple problems I noticed.. 1. There aren‚Äôt enough tasks and getting rewards is hard enough as it is. 2. There‚Äôs absolutely 0 representation the darkest character is a dark tan there are no Muslim, Indian, or black characters whatsoever. 3. There should be a trading system, my friends and I have many duplicates and it‚Äôs annoying I think this is a problem for everyone if they don‚Äôt have any other characters they want to have that item, so items we don‚Äôt want or are giving to someone for free we should be able to trade them.... Those are all my comments and things I think should be fixed.",4
"Do yourself a favor? Skip downloading this hollow experience with zero story, foolish dialogue, weak characters, repetitive combat, pointless quests, boring crafting, and terrible voice acting. Anything good here is stolen directly from Breath of the Wild. The game‚Äôs popularity relies solely on players who either 1) miss playing Zelda so much that they‚Äôll accept a cheap facsimile or 2) have no experience with the vastly superior Zelda title so they think all the innovations of open world, combat, crafting, score, etc. originate here. I played over a hundred hours of Genshin, but yesterday I overheard *ten seconds* of the Zelda score and was instantly reminded that game is vastly superior on every level. I deleted Genshin immediately. It‚Äôs a neverending slog that eats your time, brain, and money. Instead of gambling $300 for an annoying child-boy character in a stupid green suit, spend that same money to buy a Switch + Zelda?",1
"Overall I love the game and I enjoy playing it, but there are some things that really make this game not worth playing. For example, I was trying to ascend my adventure rank to level 26 and one of the challenges is to defeat an electro hypotases. This was an extremely difficult challenge and it was so hard that I stopped playing the game. A challenge where you lose over and over is does not make the game very fun. It could have been interesting if I were at a higher level, or if the challenge wasn‚Äôt timed, but overall I became bored after spending so much time trying to defeat one opponent. I think that many aspects of the game are very entertaining, but some of the opponents are just not worth it.",3
"How is this game free?!  The graphics are amazing, the animation is top quality, the voiceovers are spectacular, I‚Äôm blown away.  When the game started and told me I had only downloaded a demo and then asked me if I wanted to download the full version, I assumed that the price tag would pop up but no, it was still free.  This must truly be a labor of love.  I‚Äôm considering buying the little extras (that you don‚Äôt have to buy at all, no in app purchases required to continue the game in its entirety), just so I can support these developers.  I love the story and the characters and the beauty of the game and all of it.  Definitely one of the best games I have.  Don‚Äôt pass this one up.",5
"The game is awesome and cute but the sky is black or when I to a next place I just see on front is black (on Ipad) the video well short is lagging so bad I keep exiting the app and going back in I don‚Äôt know if you can fix it, maybe you need to fix this (or maybe it‚Äôs my apps ;-;) it‚Äôs really rageing but I still love this game no madder what. I had to delete about 20 or 10 games on my iPad and it‚Äôs like I just got my IPad at the first time but if you can fix it please do so just don‚Äôt fix one thing help every person love this game with out fix‚Äôs. The voice acting is awesome too who ever voice act some of the characters they are awesome:D.",5
"The game has far exceeded my expectations! It‚Äôs a beautiful game with a vast world to explore. The combat system isn‚Äôt overly complex but still requires thinking to make it fulfilling and enjoyable! Lots to do daily without feeling the need to play all day to exceed! Despite what people say, it is extremely F2P friendly with lots of changes to get crystals to roll for characters you want. Even the free characters are decent enough to get you through most content. Definitely worthy a try!

Remember folks that it recommends iPhone 8 Plus or above to run decently. Runs perfectly fine with an iPhone SE 2020!",5
So I found a lizard like (OH LETS PICK IT UP!) but then I took its tail I got disappointed I don‚Äôt wanna murder animals I want to hold them! Please please make it so you can hold animals! And I was like oh a froggie! Look at its little eyes.. then I murdered it and took its legs üò≠üò≠üò≠ well I haven‚Äôt caught it but I was sad. I got the frog but I wish that a frog could help you act fireflies and stuff and the animals can help fight! That would be awesome (not trying to turn it into a bad game) and also make it so you can fish and turn the fishes into meals,5
"I love Genshin impact, but I just wish you could live in a house. Instead of traveling the world all the time you can sleep and eat in your own place. I also wish you can interact with the animals. Like for example, the dogs in Mondstad, the follow you for a bit, they bark at you and seem like they want to play with you, but all you can do is watch them. I wish you could feed them and claim them as your own. It's fine if it's not added I still would play the game, but I think the game would be much more interesting if these thing were to be added.",5
"Ok so the first day I installed Genshin impact it took me like 20 min to get in because while it was loading it froze a lot. And when you get to the boss level it is so hard to defeat the boss all of my characters kept dying!!! Also it could use a little bit more superpowers and characters. But overall it is a great game!!üòÅAnd Kids and parents please read this is not a trick!!! Bye!!!!!! Lastly Pls add some more 
health bars for when you are Swimming, falling, or climbing!!!!!!!!! I kept falling from the short health bars and I think they could use a few more health bars!!!!! Bye!!!ü•∞",5
"Genshin is a very beautiful game with really good lore behind really anything in the game. Amazing cut scenes in every region, but these scenes take up a lot of storage, especially if it‚Äôs a one time thing since we cannot replay these scenes. And with a mobile device, this storage builds up. I am right now on 64gb and I‚Äòm barely able to make it to 3.1,  don't even mention 3.2. I will probably not have enough storage for it so I‚Äôll have to get a new phone with more storage. I think there should be something that can delete unwanted files or really any useless ones. I love the game, I really do but I don‚Äôt want to stop playing because I don‚Äôt have enough storage. Please do something about this Hoyo.",3
I loved this game I really did. But what made me instantly hate it is when I go back to log on after a few weeks every single character I grinded a few hours for is now gone and I can never get them back no matter what I do everytime I try to log in it puts me back to the beginning and it is so frustrating because to be fully honest I put $40 into this game for a few wishes which is my fault but bro‚Ä¶. Why do my characters have to get taken away just because I took a break from the game and came back? It ain‚Äôt that big of a deal to others but I wasted a few hours of my life on this game that I ain‚Äôt gonna get back just to get those characters taken away I‚Äôm pretty upset it‚Äôs very unfortunate but it‚Äôs whatever I guess hope this game continues to grow and that others find it better than I did,1
i have to say this game has ALOT of attractive characters and the story line is very fun and in general the game is fun. but once you finish the story and you have finished exploring and stuff and finish your commissions for the day and finished your resin and the spiral abyss and other things you may do  there‚Äôs really nothing you can do üôÅüò® especially if your a high AR so i wish that they would add more content for the end game characters but other than that i 100 % recommended this game ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©üòé and also why did the inazuma quests take like 20 years to finish üòíüòü i literally almost fell asleep listening to all that dialogue üòÑ but that could be just me üòãüôè,4
"So when i first got Genshin it was definitely a lot to grasp as soon as you open the game. And waiting for the game resources and stuff to download took a whileeeeee but it was TOTALLY worth it!
The graphics are literally so beautiful and the fighting and leveling up bc jarvager is good, makes you work for what you want in the game, but also it‚Äôs not impossible to excellent quickly if you want to.
It takes a bit to long i think personally to upgraded to rank 16 and play with your friends, but i see why.
And new nations and archons are AMAAAZING. And not to mention the charceter!! Tighnari is my fav üíö",5
"Honestly, props to the developers and story board creators. This game attracted my attention because of recommendations but the only reason I continued playing is because the lore is so interesting and because the gameplay is well balanced. There are some events, such as certain side quests, that I think are unlocked at points where the travelers aren‚Äôt ready or aren‚Äôt strong enough to complete the quest and that causes frustration. The game design is beautiful and the cutscenes are very intriguing and I get excited every time one shows up. Keep up the good work :]",5
"genshin is a really great and fun game, i love all the characters and their designs! if you‚Äôve never played genshin and you‚Äôre looking forward to playing it, it‚Äôs a really fun game that you can play with your friends and family members if they got genshin! you can do all sorts of things like quests and daily commissions to get rewards and stuff. you can also add people to play with and they can help you with your world and stuff but you can‚Äôt join them and they can‚Äôt join you unless you‚Äôre AR 16+. but overall it‚Äôs a great game, if you‚Äôve never played it you should try it sometime.",5
"The early spring update was probably the last one that I was able to play before I couldn‚Äôt play anymore (I played the rhythm game event on someone else‚Äôs phone). First of all, the quality of stories downgraded recently. I didn‚Äôt have much of a drive to finish the stories since it didn‚Äôt make me want to keep reading/listening/watching. Second of all, the game takes way too much space (it needed at least 40GB the last time I‚Äôve played it. If you haven‚Äôt opened new accounts on different servers, it is hopefully a smaller file size). I would not recommend bothering to download unless you have the latest devices (iPhone 13, iPad Air 2022, iPad Pro 2022, etc.)",3
"please add more diversity in your game. With darker skins tones & body types such as plus sized. Especially with Sumeru coming around, with the culture you chose most should be relatively dark skinned. However so far all the sumeru NPCS are white, which is not an accurate representation. We've seen you guys make plus sized npcs so its obviously not impossible for you to make them. It‚Äôs very disheartening for people to see that Sumeru may not be accurately represented and it‚Äôs just plain awful that you decide not to add brown-skinned characters for a real life inspired region that has majority brown people. This misrepresentation and un-representation of swana/south Asian people cannot go on and very many people including me are upset. This is unacceptable and something needs to change. Add more inclusivity!

Please take mine and other fans‚Äô words into consideration.

Thank you.",1
"Hoyoverse doesn‚Äôt seem to care about any servers other than the Chinese one and what they want. Also, there is no diversity in game (everyone has paper white skin) and there is no end game so it gets boring if you get good at it. It‚Äôs so obvious when playing they don‚Äôt care about us from North American or European servers :( even tho they make so much money from us too. I spent money so I don‚Äôt want to quit but I might. Also still no switch version and mobile won‚Äôt be available for much longer (it‚Äôs getting too big). It was fun while it lasted.",5
"My daughter plays this game, and she spent way too much money on it. First day she got $30 from her dad and didn‚Äôt get any character so she asked me for $15 more still no luck. Now every time she gets money she blows it in this game. She begs for more money because the game is difficult, and the character she wants will go away in a week. She plays other games but she spent most money on this one. For me it‚Äôs a money grab. Players can‚Äôt buy the character they want. They spent their gems in a type of lottery so they may be lucky or not.  Mostly they are getting the same stuff over and over again, and then get frustrated and want to spend $$$ to try again.",3
"BEST GAME EVER! I can see why it is so much storage! It is like the perfect quality! I don‚Äôt find any problems while playing this game. The characters are perfect, the animations are smooth, and the voises are amazing! My friend is having a hard time trying to delete data though and they want to have a fresh start.
And they have try‚Äôs to create a new account with a new gmail but it didn‚Äôt work so they are trying to delete it and reinstall it again. If that doesn‚Äôt work then they will have to keep playing with the data that they already have. Overall, this game is the best!",5
"This is literally the best game in the world, not even joking. If you are looking for a storyline game with cute playable characters, this is for you. The story is really creative and the graphics are beautiful. One thing I do have to say is I think the anniversary gifts are a little underhanded. Especially for veterans. But the thing is if your are a new player you will always find something to do. This is why this game is great for new people. But it can get boring sometimes for people with higher Ar‚Äôs. Bc you‚Äôll just find yourself farming all day. Other the. That pleaseeeee download this game if you have the storage. :D",5
"Best free game on the app store. Love this game, beautiful - captivating - easy to play, hard to put down! One thing that has been increasingly frustrating is the camera - it's fine when you aren't depending on a good view of what's happening - meaning, when you are in battle good luck being able to actually see the battle or what you are even fighting as the camera has this funny way of hiding behind whatever object that can obstruct your view when you absolutely need to see. It has to be a joke, or a test - i mean, why would it be that hard to keep the camera where it was like when you run around or fly or walk? Why does it only start hiding behind grass, rocks, trees and mountains when you are actually in real-time battles? I loved the game but this is kind of a deal breaker...
It's become a grinder. I'm over it.",1
"Hi mihoyo! You know Xinyan? The 4 star y‚Äôall added in December 2020? Well, where is she? She‚Äôs playable but she‚Äôs like, not in the game at all! Cmon Mihoyo, explain! Why does freaking Baizhu an NPC have more screen time than her? You might as well just kill her off (please don‚Äôt) if you‚Äôre not gonna add her in the game. Anyways this has 3 stars cause it‚Äôs a cool game. -1 star cause it killed my storage and -1 star cause Xinyan needs to exist :) I might, just MIGHT make this review 4 stars if you give her a story quest? Ok? Cool? Thanks üòΩüòΩ 

UPDATE: HEYY GENSHINNN TYSM you guys are so kind and great i love you al so muchhh!! Ty for adding xinyan in the game this review is now 4 starsssss!! Oh and like, ty for the primos too, thats like, so kind so yeah,, thanks ig :)",4
"I honestly think this is an absolutely outstanding game but.. I have a few problems this game is very addicting don‚Äôt get me wrong but   when there was an update I opened the game and then clicked the ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù button so I could continue on but after clicking the button the game kicked me out so I tried around 7 more times then I thought turning off my device would help but I came back and nothing still worked :(  Also when I got major cutscenes in the game they would freeze and the audio would come in and out but, this game is truly amazing and that‚Äôs all I have to say, thanks for reading!",4
"Game is amazing primarily if you‚Äôre new and have plenty of things to do, however after you get to the ‚Äúendgame‚Äù you quickly run out of things to do besides log in and do dailies and leave. I mainly leave this review not on just the game but Mihoyo. They blatantly ignore their community, delete what people have tried to say about their terrible rewards and despite having in game surveys, they do nothing. The game doesn‚Äôt feel like it has evolved since I started in January. Character designs are still great, but the last few ‚Äúlimited time‚Äù characters have felt off. And I‚Äôm a whale, Yoimiya, Baal and what I‚Äôve heard of Kokomi are clunky with only somewhat functioning kits if even that. The game has greatly fallen from its prime in the earlier stages. Also thanks Mihoyo for having so many people to quit your game, thanks to your own greediness.",1
"I absolutely love this game! The amount of content is sometimes overwhelming but in a good way. I knew nothing about this game, it looked interesting and caught my eye while scrolling through arcade. I downloaded it which took forever and forgot about it. A month later opened it and embarked on my first adventure as the Traveler. For newcomers my advice is don‚Äôt be discouraged. There is a definite learning curve but the more you play the more it all starts to make sense. As someone who grew up on Nintendo NES that Santa got for me in 1987, when I was 6 years old, I must say how amazing it is to play a game like this from my iPhone. BEST GAME EVER!",5
"All things considered it‚Äôs a great RPG that‚Äôs free and pretty easy to level up, have fun and experience a world similar to Breath of the wild in some ways but with a different story and more characters with weapons that don‚Äôt break!!!
The mechanics are pretty straightforward, water puts out fire, fire vaporizes ice‚Ä¶
My only complain about this game is that it drains my iPad pro‚Äôs battery (on full!) in about 2/3hrs‚Ä¶ So after a while I started playing it on PC lol
There are also some few minor bugs I‚Äôve experienced throughout the game and also I find it weird that when the NPCs talk about an item they are holding, nothing is shown‚Ä¶

Bottom Line: This is a great game for casuals and more serious gamers that enjoy a good rpg/adventure/BoTW like game. The only enemy I‚Äôve struggled to take down was a lvl 30 black assassin looking guy when my characters were lvl 20. Currently an Adventure rank 25 and the max is 60 so I can imagine the game getting very hard later on which I definitely can‚Äôt waitüî•",5
"I got this game a few months back on my pc and it‚Äôs been an amazing journey! I love this game with my heart but, it‚Äôs a pain how the app doesn‚Äôt run well on my iPad. I have a lot of storage (128GB) and it lags so much even on the lowest graphics. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my iPad that‚Äôs almost 2 years old that‚Äôs the problem or just the app. And because of this, it‚Äôs impossible for me to get the 30 day 90 primos product. I wanna spend my money on this game and it won‚Äôt let me. I don‚Äôt have a credit card so I rely on Apple gift cards to get what I want. But overall, this game is addicting, I enjoy it. 10/10",5
At first I wasn‚Äôt really playing the game but just escaping/relaxing out in the world that is Genshin Impact. I fell in love with the characters and story. I actually started taking the game seriously once I realized my characters were very weak and I couldn‚Äôt partake in some events because of it. Now I‚Äôm up to date and have realized you get bored until a new patch is made. Every update and new patch gets better. I‚Äôm not a gamer but this mobile game made me forget all about my Nintendo Switch. I even bought the newest IPhone for a better gaming experience!,5
"Hi! So I really like this game, I‚Äôm only AR13 right now so I‚Äôve just started, you can totally play this game for free it‚Äôs just a little difficult. The rates for pulling charcters are a little unfair, but! The free charcters they give you are awesome! Just like any other charcter you have to build them. The world is beautiful and the story is never not exciting. It also doesn‚Äôt penalize you if you don‚Äôt want to go through the story just yet. Though you do have to advance the story if you want to unlock certain areas and certain side quests. I will say it‚Äôs a little slow on my phone (which is not the newest phone though) so just be warned. I prefer to play on the computer. Other than that this is a very good game!",4
"The game overall is good. It‚Äôs super fun to play, the graphics are amazing, and you don‚Äôt have to spend money on it if you don‚Äôt want to and can still make progress. Sometimes the lag on mobile it pretty bad but usually that‚Äôs a good indicator to take a break. The ONLY major issue I‚Äôve had is that the game randomly logged me out once, wouldn‚Äôt let me log back in with my Game Center, and completely erased my progress (LV 38). Trying to setup again and link accounts is a nightmare: not letting me link because it‚Äôs already linked somewhere else, logging in from different areas (FB, Apple, etc.) and progress doesn‚Äôt transfer over. Basically, be careful becoming invested because one day you might lose all your progress for no reason.",3
"I really enjoy the game so far and even though I haven‚Äôt gotten very far yet I‚Äôm still enjoying myself. The only issue is that it crashes once every 30 minutes to an hour. I usually play it for a few hours at a time so having to reopen it is sometimes annoying. Another problem is that the game drains your battery very quickly, but if you play it while it‚Äôs on the charger then it‚Äôs not really a problem. A good thing about this is that even though I don‚Äôt usually enjoy open world games I decided to give this one a shot and I‚Äôm so glad I did. Even though it has its problems it‚Äôs still very fun and I highly recommend this game to everyone.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for a year now and I had many times where I quit the game to come back to it. Very recently I returned to the game and it‚Äôs pretty fun! As you may see in the other reviews there isn‚Äôt a lot of diversity in the characters skin tones, which is why it has such bad ratings. I can kind of understand why because it‚Äôs a Chinese fantasy. Chinese games don‚Äôt normally have a lot of diversity in skin tones. I would like to see more diversity as well. We have some tan characters but I understand peoples concerns with wanting more representation in skin tones. Enough about that, overall Genshin is a good game and you should atleast try it out!",4
"I love this game !! it runs surprisingly well on iPad, and what shocked me the most is how beautiful the graphics are. it‚Äôs just a lovely universe to spend time in, and the more you play the more you get to choose your own story and do whatever you like. It‚Äôs also really easy to understand, for games like these I‚Äôm often confused but that has never been a problem with genshin impact. I‚Äôm really unsure why some people are having a lot of lag and difficulty playing on iOS, because I play this game on both iPad and iPhone and it works perfectly.",5
"Imma be real, I don‚Äôt play these Anime RPG style games but I downloaded it and immediately loved it, graphics are 10/10, super high quality, the game is barely P2W which is a good thing imo so it makes you progress at a set pace rather than just being able to buy your way to a higher level, the storyline is clearly well thought out and is great, I especially love that it‚Äôs a huge open world game, letting you experiment on your own and explore. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is how slow you rank up in the game, almost feels like it takes an eternity, otherwise 
overall 9/10 game for me. Very solid game.",5
"It‚Äôs an absolutely phenomenal mobile game, the best I‚Äôve seen in a really long time, it doesn‚Äôt throw micro transactions in your face, has loads of voiced characters, a good story, fun gameplay and loads of exploration rewards with a surprising amount of content for, like I said, a mobile game. I really hope mihoyo continues to update and put out games like this, I miss the days of amazing mobile gems like aurum blade, monster wars, battle heart and more which has sadly died out in recent times with gimmicky ad filled games or blatant cash traps, but this gives me hope for at least one good mobile developer to revive the golden age of mobile games",5
I started the game and within the first cutscene the game froze on one screen but kept on playing. When I actually started the game play it was the same extremely laggy and can barely play. I was playing on iPhone 6s so that might be the problem but I really wanna play this game so I hope they fix it sometime soon. The game also kills the battery and fast even with a charger even with low power mode and brightness and nothing changed the battery went down quickly. I really wanna play the game but I think I can‚Äôt with the two problems I described still looks fun tho.,5
"Hello,
I am a loyal fan of your game and I would like to express my desire to add Arabic language as an option in the language settings. I love your game and I appreciate the effort and creativity you put into it, but I find it difficult to enjoy it fully in English only. I have trouble understanding the story and the dialogues of the game in English. I think Arabic is an important and common language and it deserves to be supported by your game.
I kindly ask you to consider this request and work on enhancing the satisfaction of Arabic fans. Thank you for your attention and understanding.
Best regards",5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the game is amazing and beautiful, but it‚Äôs just not fun anymore. It was fun when I first started, but now it‚Äôs just tiresome and grindy. I don‚Äôt mind grinding, I just don‚Äôt have enough time to grind enough to make it count. I can‚Äôt get the characters I want, because by the time I have enough for one ten pull, they‚Äôve already left. And if they are still there I don‚Äôt get a 5 star, or I lose my 50/50. It would would atleast be better if you gave 1 free ten pull per banner, then I wouldn‚Äôt need to complain. But instead you either have us spend hundreds, or make us spend months of grinding. So if you are reading this devs, please make your game actually better üôè",3
"The music, characters, visuals, combat and open world are top of the line. As someone attending both school and work, I‚Äôm able to enjoy the events, explore, and level up characters without stressing about how much time I need to spend in the game. There is always room for improvement and with each patch it just gets better. The only downside is the community. The most vocal among them play to hate the game and they will bully you into hating it too. The best experience you can have is either playing it by yourself or with close friends and family.",5
"Don‚Äôt normally leave reviews but I really like this game.  Been playing for about 2 days and I‚Äôm pretty invested now lol.  It took a nice little chunk of storage space but it‚Äôs worth it imo.  Graphics are smooth and controls are pretty good for a mobile game.  You can tell the devs paid a lot of attention to detail which is appreciated.  There is an in game store you can use real money in, but you can also grind for free in game currency (if you have time for that).  Definitely will be playing this game for as long as they put out updates for it.  By the way did I mention it‚Äôs FREE!",5
"I love this game, although throout the game sometimes it gets slow and boring, and u get stuck, just get advise from other people, do co-cop mode and actually its not that badüòÄbut, i do wish they gave put more primogems and wishing items, and more character quests i love getting characters- oh and also, adv 45 and bigger gets boring- get improved! Their should be like adv 100, or bigger it shouldnt stop!!!

Currently, Genshin isnt letting me log in, I had great progress at av 45, and NOW THE GAME MADE ME RESTART to adv-(adventure rank) 12!!!!!! I am very anygry at this point but this game was really fun and i couldnt stop playing, thats my review.",5
"This is the best video game I‚Äôve ever played. There‚Äôs main quests and a storyline that you can follow, but there‚Äôs also other goals that you can give yourself like defeating bosses, doing domains, ascending characters or weapons, exploring the world, getting new characters and a lot more. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that Genshin Impact is a game with a plot, but it‚Äôs not a strict one. You can do whatever you like and not fall behind. Another thing- the scenery. The artists behind this game are just amazing at creating the art for both the world and the character designs. Gorgeous, I totally recommend playing!",5
"The game is great but when your darker poc lineup is like 4 people it‚Äôs embarrassing Especially when sumeru is based off the Middle East where darker skin tones are commonly found, Plus the pronunciation of Tighnari in English literally being (tie-nare-re) which is heavily butchered. kusanali being based off a god and not having a similarity to her at all and being almost LIGHTER than paper is not a good look at all. And the majority of poc in sumeru being labeled as an enemy puts a bad taste in my mouth. Let‚Äôs not forget Kaeya, he has been whitewashed in official arts.  Hoyoverse puts effort in their game except when it comes to accuracy of darker poc characters. I do not have high hopes for natlan which is based of the indigenous people of America. People need to see themselves in media so they feel represented and genshin impact is barely doing the bare minimum",1
The game was overall fantastic even perfect for people who enjoy anime and makes it in 3D with great characters and waifus or husbandos the game becomes impossible to play any longer I would say around mid/late game since if you don‚Äôt get a good team it‚Äôs impossible or near the vacinity to get the best 5 stars possible without spending a single penny. It becomes highly pay to win gacha game maybe even the mother of all gacha games. This issue won‚Äôt get better but it will get worse as things go on because more characters are getting released into the game making it a long battle to keep grinding daily and getting primo gems. I stopped at lvl 50 because I couldn‚Äôt go on for longer. I hope this info was useful and this issue won‚Äôt get changed keep that in mind,1
"Genshin Impact is simply a wonderful game! With a compelling story line, and a cast of cute characters it‚Äôs sure to please just about anyone! However, all of this great content comes at a price. Genshin Impact may have a bit too much content, as it often crashes on simpler devices. The overwhelming amount of information stored in this game is simply too much for lesser devices to handle. Though you are capable of turning the graphics down to make it more manageable, when this is done the game isn‚Äôt as beautiful as it usually is. This is the only reason I‚Äôll e deducting one star, as it simply is a shame that this game contains so much beauty.",4
"i used to enjoy playing genshin, but i‚Äôm absolutely fed up with the blatant racism, colorism, and orientalism that hoyoverse has displayed. sumeru is a region which is supposed to be based on south asia, west asia, and north africa, and yet, every single character from the region that we have seen so far is as white as paper. it is redundant to make a region based on real life cultures only for it to not accurately reflect the people of said cultures. additionally, it‚Äôs disrespectful in itself that hoyoverse combined 20+ cultures into one big orientalist mess and clearly put no effort into accurately portraying ANY of the cultures they took influence from. it is completely unfair that places such as germany, china, and japan get accurate representation in their respective inspired regions (mondstadt, liyue, inazuma) but countries with primarily brown & black POC get treated like this. i‚Äôm done with this game.",1
"I find it very upsetting that Genshin has little to none dark skin characters, especially sumeru, a place that is based off of my culture. Like if you‚Äôre racist just say that üòê. Are you really that scared of darker skintones and the fact that the Archon is lighter than klee and diona is upsetting. I know sumeru is also based on the jungle as well but the Jungle Book also beat you when it comes to representation, this game is just horrible, even Fortnite got better representation than you. Any game not made by hoyoverse has good representation, and I‚Äôm not saying one character from sumeru should be dark skinned, I‚Äôm saying all of them should be dark skinned. I first deleted this game because of how much time it takes but now I hate this game because it just shows just how much you hate darker skinned people, do better hoyoverse.",1
"It‚Äôs a pretty game. Much to explore and much you can do. However. It‚Äôs boring. 

After you finish or catch up to the storyline. There is very little left in what you can do. The game from here on gets repetitive. It‚Äôs the waiting, completing story, doing event, and rinse-wash-repeat. 

I know very little about what really goes on in making a game. But seeing in what other companies can do with their budget and looking over to seeing what hoyoverse does is pretty disappointing. (Knowing they earn millions per character banner)

Especially with the lack of representation the characters have. Using inspiration from a region that holds a majority population of people of color and having none of that represented in-game is very disrespectful. 

Other regions were researched well, how come it‚Äôs so difficult to that do with the upcoming ones? 

Don‚Äôt be like christians who believe Jesus is white even though he‚Äôs from the middle east..

It‚Äôs literally a quick google search. 

And im positive it does not take long to make a character a few shades darker. AND to keep them that shade too. 

The whitewashing is a embarrassing thing. 

P.S - ur whole team lacks creativity. at this point just hire a child.",1
"This game is insanely good, no matter what genre you enjoy playing. Story? Genshin has it. Puzzle? Genshin has it. Fighting? Genshin has it. Adventure? Genshin has it. Each section has an immense amount of detail put into it. The open world nature of this game is the perfect vessel for it all. However, this game does have its issues. In the very begging, the mechanics and game progression feels very daunting at first. I found myself having to look up tutorials and wandering around where I didn't need to be. But overall, if you are willing to problem solve, this game is such an engrossing game that teleports you into the world.",5
"Love Genshin Impact. I preordered the game and started playing when it launched. I have played consistently everyday since :) The developers have listened and changed or tweaked a lot of stuff since the game was initially released which i‚Äôm thankful for. Every game has bugs here and there and it‚Äôs bound to happen no matter what. Overall the game is very well designed and playable. 

The game is also more than Gacha-
people are complaining about this but this games main point is not gacha. Get a new playable characters/weapons every few weeks with the occasional rerun here and there. The game doesn‚Äôt require these to be played and you still have the chance to roll a fair amount from events. Meanwhile multiple events / exploring / world building is constantly being updated and new features added. Playing genshin for an hour or two everyday is always great and the last year has been amazing ü§ó 

Thanks for the beautiful free game mihoyo !",5
"Overall, I absolutely love this game. It‚Äôs free, the graphics are great considering its a mobile game, and the story and plot are super interesting. However there is one GLARING issue: you can‚Äôt cancel quests. Right now the lantern rite event is going on, and one of the event quests is blocked because I haven‚Äôt completed the Chi of Guyun Quest. I can‚Äôt beat it for the life of me, and I just want to quit it and come back after I‚Äôve completed the Lantern Rite event. However, there‚Äôs no way to cancel a quest once you‚Äôve started it, so I have to complete it before I move on in Lantern Rite. This is insanely frustrating because it‚Äôs a limited event and I want to be able to complete it, but I can‚Äôt thanks to this one issue.",4
"Well this is me rewriting my review again because it was deleted or not approved it seems, the game is great and it‚Äôs very fun to explore when you start out or a new area releases‚Ä¶ BUT it‚Äôs repetitive and gets boring once you have done everything, not enough content. Not listening to community is huge as well, resin can we get more? Or better drops for artifacts at least? Oh and don‚Äôt get me started on the anniversary rewards HAH best joke 2021, I have over 250 days of login in this game and have spent over $250 but I only get 10 wishes for playing for a year‚Ä¶ it hurts.",5
"I play this game obsessively, even though there‚Äôs barely any content left for me to do, other than dailies, building my characters and going into random co-op worlds. I love it, I can say that, but there are many issues with the game, community, and developers. First of all, the devs don‚Äôt often like listening to the community, and the Genshin team has a tendency to be greedier than the Honkai dev group, as seen by how much they like giving back to the community who has given them billions of dollars. I personally don‚Äôt care too much about that though, I‚Äôm just saying this from most of the community‚Äôs perspective. There‚Äôs also controversy in the community, but I‚Äôm not sure how to get into that.",3
If you‚Äôre like me and like sword art online or anything like that you will 100% love and cherish this game like it was your firstborn child. It‚Äôs a wonderful game the entire idea of it is flawless and the fact that in most role-playing games you are limited by boring tasks like herding pigeons this game is a free roaming game meaning that instead of trying to help an old woman find some bread you can go in battle an ice giant stop magical ice from attacking a mountain or find the way that your twin sister got Attacked by a magical person and there‚Äôs so much to do in this world and it‚Äôs so much fun and I highly recommend it,5
"Downloaded this because I heard a couple of people talk about it and now I have it on my phone, iPad, and laptop.  I have always struggled with console gaming and it‚Äôs really discouraging when I want to play a game with my friends but I just can‚Äôt keep up with their level because console controls are too difficult for me a lot of the time.  Being able to play Genshin on mobile has been life changing, and the cross platform support means not only can I play with my console using friends, but I can keep up with and even surpass their level of play!",5
"I just love, the graphics, storyline. And side quests. It‚Äôs so free world likely. Plus I do like the fact this gacha game is very top tier. Plus, it really fits to have a good mobile game since on ipad/or androids. They don‚Äôt have good graphics, or the storyline. I‚Äôm pretty picky on a game, that is gacha like. But this it when going in my style. But one thing that it‚Äôs annoying is the glitches when there‚Äôs a high graphic cutscene it lags out but not crash that goodness. But it‚Äôs annoying, and needed to be fix‚Äôs right away! As for now keep making improvements on the future. And continue the storyline! :D ‚ú®",5
"This game is so amazing, although it takes up quite the bit of space. I love this game so much it‚Äôs so swaggy. I would give up all of my apps just for Genshin. I definitely recommend. Not very good for smaller devices though. Kind of difficult at the beginning of the game but it gets better once you realize what to do. I don‚Äôt have a lot of patience and for some reason this game keeps me busy. If you want something to do this game never gets boring, but it may keep you in your room for hours. (I also love how you don‚Äôt have to spend money to enjoy the best of the game!)",5
"i love this game, the story is great so far and i love all the characters! i also like the graphics and voiceacting.
I am only giving four stars because i think there are some things they need to fix. 
I think they should do something about all the hacked accounts, like adding 2FA. Ive heard of peoples accounts being trashed or locked out and im scared of it happening to me.
Another thing they should make better is gacha rates. They are unfair to people who cant spend lots of time and money on the game. Boosting them a bit would really help the game.
The last thing i wish they would fix is endgame content, Like adding more resin so we could fight more bosses, And i think the housing system in 1.5 might help this a bit because it gives us something new to do.

Other than this, the game is great! like i said, The graphics and story are amazing.
I also love the characters.
If they fix those, i think the game would be alot better and so i hope they fix them soon.",5
"I think this game is great, I think most people do when I read the reviews it‚Äôs just a bunch of people complaining about not getting the characters they want, it‚Äôs a shame they bring down the overall rating with their I want free stuff mind set but I think this is a great game my only complaint is that once you hit AR30 the content is quite stale and the updates don‚Äôt really give any big changes or a lot of new content but I understand it‚Äôs a phone game and some of these peasants can‚Äôt afford a pc or a iPhone 12 to keep up with huge content drops. Overall 10/10 game",5
"When I first downloaded the game, I had mixed feelings about it. Usually with mobile games I end up deleting them after getting bored with it. But this is totally different! The graphics are totally amazing and the details are beautiful! It is SO. MUCH. FUN!! I‚Äôve been playing it for only a few days and I‚Äôve been so invested! I have already spent hours on it! I would totally recommend this game to everyone! And it‚Äôs not just for mobile! 

A lot of people say it‚Äôs laggy on mobile because it‚Äôs such a bug game but it runs amazingly and smoothly for me! If you are reading this review right now, then you should totally download Genshin!",5
Overall the game itself is splendid and I am easily addicted to this game. Sadly it‚Äôs not so good for us mobile players since it takes up an awful amount of storage than I think it needs. It‚Äôs probably better to play on PC but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs free to play on there. I don‚Äôt know. I really wish mihoyo would try to focus on making the game to where it doesn‚Äôt need 10gb+ of storage. It‚Äôs also laggy especially for me since the latest pre installation so that‚Äôs affecting the game as well. I‚Äôd really love it if mihoyo could try harder to find a way of making it take less space and easier for mobile players instead of adding new characters and events.,4
"it‚Äôs a great game, i really love the idea of it and all of the work that was put into it. i just have one complaint. this is a short review, so don‚Äôt expect a thorough explanation of what i dislike. 

whenever i attempt to fight a boss, halfway through the fight (at the least), the boss would teleport to the center of the arena (or the main area that they‚Äôre being fought at) and it would generate all of its health back. i know that this is a function with some of the bosses, such as the cubes, to regenerate their health at a certain phase. but on my end, the boss doesn‚Äôt even have an animated teleport. more like ‚Äúthey were there, but their entire character disappeared and now they‚Äôre behind you and have all of their health back,‚Äù kinda thing. it‚Äôs a bit infuriating when i have put a lot of effort into the fight too, such as using my best materials like food with stat boosts. but in the end, i cant do anything about it and just have to deal with it because game developers seem to not really care about the issues in their game, but more about the content that they‚Äôre getting out.",4
"The game itself is very thought out and overall very impressive, I love the game so far and have played it for about two days the one problem I did run into however was the download. I‚Äôm not asking for you to fix this because you have no control in the matter but for those with iPhones you may run into the same problem I did. It took over an hour to download the app, at first I had thought it was my storage but was confused when I found out I‚Äôm barely even using half of it. I still deleted apps and photos that might have been taking up storage and it still would not download very fast.",4
"I love everything about this game except one little thing. Although it might be simple the only thing I wish for the developers to do with this wonder if a game is to be able to have your party members follow you instead of only be on the side of the screen to click. I love the anime/manga artstyle of this game . Thank you for making in my opinion one of the BEST mobile games of this century. If you read this, alI ask of you is to let your party members follow you when you move and when you enter a fight with an enemy of some sort, they start to assist in battling them.",5
"This is a great game. Especially for a gatcha game. However, I‚Äôm finding it hard to care about wishes when leveling characters is such a pain. It‚Äôs very counter intuitive in a game that focuses on collecting characters to make it such a pain to level them. It‚Äôs slowly killing my momentum in the game sadly. You can‚Äôt even really try a character out or try different combos because you have to sink all of your exp items into a main team to make meaningful progress. If something isn‚Äôt done about it I‚Äôll probably just quit at this rate. 

Makes me sad not to give it a five star rating but they‚Äôre being greedy even by gatcha standards at this point. Which is silly because why would I spend money to get a character I can‚Äôt even use?",3
"This is what I‚Äôve been seeing on my iPad screen so far. Cannot see far off into the distance, the background is black; entering water makes the avatar turn into a scorching lighbulb making it impossible to even see any details of surrounding, let alone the face of the avatar; no way of knowing what the avatar is fighting because you cannot even see the details of the monster from a distance (you can fight the monster by looking at the lvl number as for what it is cannot see because it black). Moreover, during the main quest arch after getting glider and some wind monster came, the screen is black. In short it‚Äôs too bright, too black can‚Äôt see fine details, impossible to enjoy the world and animations are jaggedy like a broken video which doesn‚Äôt flow smoothly. If I could post some screenshot I would‚Äôve already. It‚Äôs hurting my eyes. 

Thank you.",1
"I love love love love LOVE this game. The only other game that has mechanics close to this is SAO Integral Factor, and I‚Äôve been trying to find another game like it where it‚Äôs not super easy to level up to lvl 50 by doing one quest, and I love how it‚Äôs not pay to win. My only problem is the lag and how it crashes on my phone occasionally. That‚Äôs a little frustrating. But other than those two things, AMAZING game!!!! (P.s. maybe in the future can we possibly get mounts in the game? Traveling from one area to a new one takes a while. I think it would be nice to have like a horse or something to ride on to get to new places!!!)",5
"This game is incredible. I play on both IOS and my PC and both experiences are great. The world is beautiful, massive, and there‚Äôs always something hidden behind each corner. The combat is fun and fast paced. The progression system keeps you grinding. For me it‚Äôs just about everything I wanted BOTW to be. It‚Äôs free give it a shot. I will say the PC experience is top notch feels better because you don‚Äôt have to worry about touch controls or a smalls screen! Also your progress goes with you! I can finish up a quest or something while I‚Äôm on my work break or laying in bed that I didn‚Äôt do while in my main gaming session.",5
"Am a mobile user, as I wanted to game at work ‚Ä¶ and stumbled upon this while downloading some games to try. I had never heard of it or seen ads (strangely enough). I went through the other terrible mobile games and deleted them and finally it was Genshin Impacts turn. I was hooked from the start. I loved the fighting style, the game is beautiful, the characters are great. I‚Äôve read negative things due to spending money etc, I‚Äôve put in quite a few hours and have never spent a cent. I haven‚Äôt run into anything that I can‚Äôt do with a little bit of patience! Great game!",5
"This game is freaking awesome, I mean the designs, the characters, the graphics, the quest are amazing. The quest are wow and the fall of the jade chamber that‚Äôs crazy it was awesome. Right now I‚Äôm on the ritou mission which is kicking me . Like that dumb samurai is in the way and I‚Äôm at world level 3 but it a fun game. That ritou mission tho got me crazy. Right now I‚Äôm trying to build my characters. I‚Äôm bout to go fight a boss. Genshin keep up the good work, plus the theories and piamon and the sustainers of heavenly Principles is crazy. Thank you for creating such and amazing game. Even tho I can‚Äôt get not one five star. I really want diluc. Like come on",5
"When you first start playing it is AMAZING!! You can do things, you meet new characters, you get easy rewards, and it‚Äôs just overall super funüëç but once you get more into it and advanced, things start going down hill. Such things as taking up WAY to much storage, i have been playing this game for quite a but of time and it takes up almost 20GB, i love this game and the fact that i might have to quit because i don‚Äôt have enough storage breaks my heart. If you can it would be AMAZING if you would make it take up less storage because im pretty sure every 20 days it adds another 3GB‚Äôs and the app itself is 3.46GB.",4
"i myself am not south asian, so please try to correct me if im wrong on the matter. so as we know the new characters Kusanali, Tighnari, Al haitam and Candace. First i‚Äôll start with Kusanali, Kusanali is inspired off a goddess who is ‚Äúas white as the moon‚Äù but if i look at that specific Hindu goddess her design is cultural and Kusanali looks nothing like her, and she acts like a child. Even Candace who is based off a dark skinned queen is super pale in contrast. Plus Al haitam from what i‚Äôve heard has no representation at all, then Tighnari who‚Äôs name is pronounced wrong by the Va‚Äôs and he‚Äôs pale, same for Al haitam. I really don‚Äôt understand why this company is so scared of giving characters dark skin. THE DARKEST WE GOT WAS CANDACE?!? Why is this company so colourist and racist. Why are you scared of SKIN..? I deleted genshin impact before the new update because i don‚Äôt want to support your company in any way.",1
"The lack of diversity truly breaks my heart. The range of skin tones, the body types, etc. are very limited. There is no excuse, when they‚Äôre researching (if at all) for these cultures I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre able to see the real skin tones & clothing styles that could be adapted in a more tasteful manner. Even the Japanese player base was upset about some of the choices made for Inazuma. For a global game, more thought should be put into these things.

I‚Äôm just tired of being disappointed & kicked to the side. You‚Äôre literally leaving out a huge chunk of your player base that genuinely WANTS to enjoy your game. How can we when you treat us so poorly? How can we when you show that you are capable of adding dark skin (only for the enemies that we beat) but avoid having it in the playable characters? The implication are awful.",1
"This game has gone down hill very quickly, basic characters are continuously being made with no actual clear diverse characters design which leads to boredom and repetitive designs. They use inspiration from cultures without the people, they take Bits and pieces and use them as they want, terrible rewards, not beginner friendly, example: if you get a inazuma character at AR 10 Good luck trying to level them up, you have to unlock all of inazuma first. I am sick and tired of seeing the same pale, overly sexual outfits on the same 4 models, when the use different areas of the world to show where these characters supposedly come from. They also don't listen to the player base AT ALL and it's taken them being sued for them to care about a single thing people have been asking for.",1
I really enjoy playing Genshin because it reminds me of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild expect if it updated every so often with new content and wasn‚Äôt limited to one character. The gameplay and music of Genshin is amazing and it‚Äôs obvious that the developers value quality over quantity to a degree. One of the biggest issues I find with Genshin is how lacking it is with skin tones. Genshin is based off of the real world and for it to barely have any dark skin tones is upsetting. You can find people of every skin tone all around the real world ‚Äîyet Teyvat only has two playable characters with darker skin. Everyone else has pale skin. It almost seems like the developers have something against making characters have darker skin tones. Please do better and add more diverse characters. Darker skins are just as beautiful as paler skins. ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
"I know there are a lot of bad reviews but I think it depend on what you play in on, personally I play it on my iPad Air which I made sure I had extra storage on. I started playing during hu-taos 3rd re-run and before you tell me that I don‚Äôt know what it feels like since I have a lot of storage you‚Äôre wrong when I first started playing I had barely any storage but not to long ago I got a new iPad as a early birthday gift. Anyways it really just depends what you play on, I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing new characters and I‚Äôm looking forward to the new area updates :)",5
"Look im sorry, this game is a COMPLETE rip off of botw (breath of the wild). If you dont know what Zelda: breath of the wild is, it is made by Nintendo, is an open world game much like this, and it is an exclusive to Switch (any model) 

Here is some of the things that have gone ‚Äúsouth‚Äù with this game

1. There are teleportation points in the game, much like botw
2. There are these little blob thingies, like chuchus in botw
3. Idk what they are called, but there are some monsters that look suspiciously like moblins

And the list goes on. Oh. One more thing, you can pay for stuff. It completely ruins the aspect of it. Like you want me to pay for a charecter that has a special ice power or something. Heck no. Also, this game shouldn‚Äôt even be on the App Store, it has suggestive elements, like when you switch too japan‚Äôs dialogue, when one of the female characters climb up a wall, they start moaning. LIKE MOANING. And not to mention the suggestive outfits too.

I used to play this game, but i just took up too much storage and wasn‚Äôt enjoyable. I get it if you don‚Äôt own a switch or something but SERIOUSLY. WHYYYY. Anyways ima go play angry birds.",3
"Overall this game is so fun to play and has helped me through a lot the only problem is that now i cant keep experiencing the fun in the game because im not able to log into my account so now i have to use a new one,
Im not sure if its my device or if the game has a bug but my friends also havent been able to enter my account to see if its been hacked or not , I've tried all my passwords and users i have linked to the account but it keeps saying ‚Äúaccount or password error.‚Äù Mihoyo please fix this because the same happened to another friend of mine and they had to completely restart",4
"really enjoying the game so far, but it blocks music from playing in the background on apple music. 

no reason for this anti-user feature to exist in an otherwise excellent game. It is clearly not a bug, and has persisted for at least a year. months after writing this, no changes have been made. Very disappointed to have a great game take this action against its players. shame on anyone involved in making this decision. 

UPDATE: After finding a workaround that allowed me to play the music i enjoy  while playing the game (something that should be considered a basic kindness to players), IT WAS PATCHED OUT. the devs have pushed me away with this cruel act. i wish i knew what it takes to drive someone to hate their fans and supporters so strongly. disappointing as always.",1
"In my honest opinion, when I first saw the trailer I thought that it was going to be some type of game that requires you to buy 6$ to remove ads, or getting random ads in a game. But no, this game is way too good for a mobile game. I honestly love the game so much, I play it almost everyday after school and it is a stress reliever game. Spiral Abyss, and the Archon Quests are the main reason why I love this game. Although there are some issues with end game content, and mobile settings I will still play this game no matter what. The lore & everything is amazing. Keep up the great work, Mihoyo!",5
"I love this game as it has some of the most compelling characters from a free game i have played! However some of the stories feel like a fetch quest where you run place to place rather than like mondstadt or inazuma with their compelling story line. Liyue was by far my least favorite and most boring, but aside from that, great job on inazuma! The last act could of not been as rushed but aside from that it‚Äôs very enjoyable and fun. Customer service could use some work as well, however i‚Äôm glad they atleast respond to emails timely. I can‚Äôt wait to support you in the future and continue to play this amazing game. Sumeru is next! ‚ô•Ô∏è",4
"This used to be a five star review. I‚Äôve played Genshin since the day it launched, and loved the characters, art, story.  Unfortunately my experience has gone downhill very quickly as of late. The storyline in Inazuma is convoluted and boring. The new characters have been released half done and with many issues. The resin system desperately needs to be amended.  I don‚Äôt understand why they would cap players from being able to grind and spend more time on their game. High adventure rank players no longer have anything else to do, so it‚Äôs basically logging in and right back out everyday. I‚Äôm having a really hard time justifying playing anymore and just holding out some that there is some improvement soon. Please listen to your long standing players, and improve your game.",1
"Firstly I would like to say that Genshin Impact is by far the best RPG that I have played, at least on an iOS Device, but the frustrating fact about the game, at leas to me is that it seems to like to kick me out of the game when I am in the middle of a quest, but one saving grace is that when I re-enter the game it usually doesn‚Äôt lose all of my progress within the quest, and it is not linked to one specific quest. I also do understand that the game is a work in progress and I hope that some upcoming updates, with the maps/quests and whatever, also deal with the glitches of the game like getting kicked out every so often",4
"Genshin has such a vast open-world with tons of little hidden spots to find. I love exploring nature in real life, but it was hard to go anywhere during quarantine. Genshin Impact really satisfied that desire to explore outdoors to a degree I didn‚Äôt even know existed. Now all I want to do is go on hikes all the time and listen to nature. A lot of people will be quick to solely call this a gacha game and only value it as such, but it really is one of the best open-world games I have ever played. It‚Äôs also relatively easy for beginners at combat games to pick up. There is a lot more to it than gacha addicts care to talk about.",5
"Absolutely love this game! The graphics are astonishing and I can‚Äôt get enough of it. Character designs, storyline, everything is amazing but bestie‚Ä¶ I need more primojems. Like seriously I need them. 160 primojems per wish is a lot. That‚Äôs 3 days worth of commissions. That‚Äôs crazy! I either need more ways to get primojems or make the wishes cheaper. Mihoyo, you‚Äôre still gonna make a bunch of money if wishes are only 100 primos. Heck even if they are 150 I just need something to change I‚Äôm BEGGING YOU! But still love you‚Äôre game and I‚Äôm still gonna play even if wishes are expensive. Also while you‚Äôre at it maybe give me more resin but I really just want more primojems.",4
"For a long time I‚Äôve found myself scrolling through the App Store for a game that made me remember the reason I played games and since day one Genshin Impact has provided that to me. I grew up on Zelda, Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64 and such so the need for a mobile RPG that offers that open world adventure was dire. Genshin Impact is what the mobile gaming world needed and has been waiting on since the advent of the smartphone. Graphics? A+++. Storyline? A+++. Challenge? A+++. Gameplay? A+++. I want to thank the developers for taking the chance and realizing we needed something more. Looking forward to future updates and more....",5
"I love this game. Like too much. The art, graphics, and storyline are all amazing and I love every second of it. It‚Äôs even more fun when it comes to co-o ping with friends. And I recommend getting this game 100%

Something you should avoid is the Trail of Tianqiu. If you do end up doing that quest, do not lay it off. It won‚Äôt let you co-op until you‚Äôve completed it and is a pain to do if your adventure rank is 30+. Which is one of the reasons why I‚Äôve given this a four star. All I really ask is to let the player co-op, even if the quest isn‚Äôt done. I personally don‚Äôt have it done just yet and it‚Äôs been months since I wasn‚Äôt able to co-op because of this.",4
"Now this game is beyond my expectations! Simply wonderful, amusing, and incredibly addictive! The details and style of the game are simply breathtaking, but I have to say the character designs are possibly my favorite part of the game. The designs are just gorgeous! But... it pains me so badly that I cannot play nor pet the adorable dogs and cats within the cities... :( It would be just perfect if we could treat them with spare meat or fowls & be able to pet them! Other than that, the game is overall amazing! The only thing I can complain about is when it crashes but it doesn‚Äôt happen too often! Hope to see amazing updates soon!",5
"Okay, I LOVE the Game very much!
It‚Äôs The best Game I‚Äôve Liked In Such a While. I hope To see The storyline Updated and Different New Things Added To The Game! 
I Like Playing, I play It For like, 5-8 Hours A Day Grinding and Defeating Monsters.
Though What I was Dissatisfied About was... I joined Late To the game, I just Started a Week Ago. So I‚Äôm Very Sad and Dissatisfied That I missed Many Events/Character Banners.
I Would Love The Game More and More,(Even Maybe Spend Money On it) If They Repeat some Of The Characters To Get in The wish. 
‚ÄòCause 
There is Some People Who play Genshin Impact, Like me, Who either: Missed The Opportunity Or Tried but Never got it.
So I would Be Very Thankful And Grateful If The Genshin Impact Developers Go Back And Add The Previous events Towards The Present.
It‚Äôs Also Kind of easier For The you guys(Developers), Cause You don‚Äôt Have To use your Creative Mind to Make A New Character To Wish For each and Every Time a Event is over.
It will cause Less Stress(In My Opinion).
So I would Be so Thankful If You do.
(P.S I really wanted Childe/Tartaglia But I can‚Äôt-)",4
"Honestly tho , this game has the best gameplay, graphics, and fantasy I have ever played. It‚Äôs so fun and I just admire how much work must‚Äôve went into it. From I know, this is the only mobile game I have played, that would seem to be premium on Xbox or Nintendo. I‚Äôm always jealous of my friends that have Xbox and Nintendo, because they have games that I can‚Äôt play on my phone, but now there the jealous ones, and we now all play at the same time, racing to finish the tasks. In other words, this game is revolutionary for all mobile games, opening a whole new gameplay for mobile.",5
"First off I‚Äôd like to say I gave 4 stars only because there is room for improvement like most games. But I currently don‚Äôt have any complaints besides more ‚Äúin game‚Äù shop option.

I am playing this on an iPhone 11 Pro Max currently.

-Graphics are really great! Colors are vibrant and details are well thought out.

-The option of 60 FPS is awesome! Hopefully even higher FPS in the next updates!

-Seems to be many character choices with various specialties. Such as Pyro type hero using spell book or a Pyro hero using a physical weapon.

-Open world seems to be decently vast, and your character can scale many different objects. 

I have played/play other games where you have a team of characters and a fairly open world realm. But this one tops those so far in many ways.

This game isn‚Äôt cluttered with an infinite stream of random chats popping up. It also doesn‚Äôt have a ton of ads for in shop items available to purchase all over the screen. 
So the screen stays fairly clean and visible. That‚Äôs a huge plus in my opinion.

Definitely worth trying it out!",4
"Game is good, but the company IS VERY VERY GREEDY, almost everything is behind paywall, once you hit a certain level I literally only play 30 minutes a day then I log out.. if I want to play more i have to pay. But you also have to pay for new characters, and new weapons. And on top of that you won‚Äôt be able to even level them up unless you pay. Andddd on top of that! If you want them stronger you have to pay for the character again 6 times oh and I also forgot to mention each high tier character costs around 360$ to obtain and you have to obtain em 6 times to get the full experience. And they‚Äôre getting greedier by the minute, they lack communication with their playerbase. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where everyone is protesting and the game isn‚Äôt even out for 3 months yet... 1 star review for the trash company that‚Äôs behind a good game smh.",1
"Hi im 9 and useing an ipad, ive tryed to download this game because i reallyyyy want zelda, breath of the wild on a nintendo swich, but i dont have eather and my parents wont get me one üò≠ so i tryed this game because it looked kind of like zelda but not on a nintendo swich, but i tryed to download it and it is NOT LOADING so i tryed deleting some of my apps and photos that i dident care about, but its stuck on half of a quarter of the way there, please fix this if you can, but idk if its just the fact im on an ipad not an iphone, i realllyyyy want to try this game!!!

"This game is amazing!!! From the graphics to the story, from the music to the character customizations. All deserves 5 or even a flawless 10 rating. The downside is the lack of minerals to respawn, the amount of weapons we can make, the very small ability to find a main resource and their positions Geoculus, the lack of mission freedom in coop, and a few other minor things. That said we know it‚Äôs new so we can‚Äôt wait for more characters, areas, and this game screams crossover summons.. For the love of us all make that possible ü§£ I stream this game daily on ps4 and mobile so you have a lot of fans asking for more üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ Keep up the great work..",5
"I absolutely love this game and have been playing it almost none stop since I downloaded it! üòä My only drawback is that I would love for this game to be controller compatible. üòïAs you progress and get to higher mobs and dungeons, movement and flow of attacks becomes difficult because your fingers cover most of the screen. Which most of the time leads to you pressing jump or the wrong attack. Considering this game is already controller compatible because of it being available on PS4. It really makes no sense for it not to be on the phone. I would love to see this feature added to the game. That‚Äôs really the only drawback to this game.",4
"This app is overall great, the graphics, the plot, and stuff like that, but this year (2023) they are holding a lantern rite (the lantern rite is actually the day I‚Äôm posting this) and you can get a free 4 star character from liyue well i got super exited for the free 4 star cause I rlly wanted xianglings constellation well I was checking what time it started today and saw that I can‚Äôt participate and I can‚Äôt get the character. You have to be adventure rank 28 and I am only adventure rank 24. I wish they would be more inclusive for the newer players I‚Äôm my opinion newer players need a new character more then a older player.",4
"Omg. I have been playing for 3 days now and taking it slow and just taking everything in. The visuals and soundtrack is perfect 5/5. The story is also really good. There‚Äôs a bunch of depth to characters (even side characters). I would feel sad for this guy npc that I did a quest with and I‚Äôll never see him again. This game is literally like a really good fantasy anime, but in the form of a video game. Everything is f2p. I haven‚Äôt spent money on this game and I rolled a 5 star character and a few really great 4 stars, but also because I can‚Äôt believe that this games free.. I‚Äôm going to support the game/developers by dropping a few bucks. I‚Äôm addicted.",5
"Genshin is a great game, the lore about the two travelers are AMAZING can‚Äôt forget about the other characters too! The thing about wishing is if u don‚Äôt get the 5 star u want in at least 60 or 70 pulls, the next 5 star will be GUARANTEED the 5 star u wanted. The quests are a great way of exploring Teyvat and getting materials like exp books and mora. Daily commissions are also a good way to get materials mora and primogems. When updates come to Genshin I‚Äôm ALWAYS excited and looking for new characters and monsters. I‚Äôve been playing since Klee was out and ever since Genshin had developed A LOT better.",5
"I love this game with all my heart, the open world exploration, the stories, the events, the characters, everything. I have spent many hours on this game (regretfully my parents aren‚Äôt allowing me to redownload it‚Ä¶) and it‚Äôs so fun, I 100% recommend it
The only thing is that once you‚Äôve reached end-game, finished all quests and stories and events, and used all your resin, there isn‚Äôt much to do by yourself except for exploring and spiral abyss
HOWEVER 
That‚Äôs where co-op mode comes in! You can meet many people and help out lower ranked players, you may meet some of your best friends in co-op like I did :)",5
"An amazing game. Graphics, story, characters, just mwah.

Some things that bother me is the fact that you cant go back to old quest and reread dialogue, at least not that I know of. Also the fact that there is no skip button (which would save a lot of time on those long ten minutes talking sequences in quests that take forever). Besides that I love the game.

Sure, farming is a bit tedious if you miss a day that a certain ascension material is out, but you can just wait a but longer for it to come back around. Farming is actually quite fun since you get to anticipate the next fight and to level something up that you need!",4
"I like it! But it said I had too much storage, so I deleted an app but it said too much storage still and I have 24.1 GB. I rate it a 4/5 I don't wanna be rude but, this game hurts me than It hurts you.. Cause I had to DELETE everything! I just wanted to know if this game can do better‚Ä¶ thank you for reading this. (I am not trying to be hurtful, or mean, or negative.) Again, Thank you developers for reading this. And also this is for a good comment on this review! 
I just have one 3 words! Its bad quality! üòíand why does it have bad quality I DONT KNOW! And we will never know! That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt really like mobile games but guess what?! I DONT CAREEE.
(LOL this is a joke‚Ä¶)",4
"The game is very good and pretty fun but the only thing is that it needs to much space. I want to continue playing but now i don‚Äôt have space which it‚Äôs very sad. If there is a way to continue playing that would be nice. That is basically my/the problem it needs to much space but understand because there are things are improving, gameplay and updates. But even tho. I want to continue playing so like i just say if there is a way to continue playing without using to much space that would great. (Also im not trying to be rude or something its just is a great/cool game (its just very sad)) Also its an AWESOME game.",4
"Y‚Äôall it so fun and the characters are so cute!and I like how we don‚Äôt start off with raggy ugly characters,instead we get a cool magical looking character,at first you might be scared to fight some mobs but then you wont!

	I even love the tiny details!,Especially the the kids,I don‚Äôt know why people would give hate on such a wonderful game!,i get that it get boring when you get like AR 45+ but my brother hasn‚Äôt quit and he helps me in the game,and other people help you with the game so that‚Äôs smth I rlly like :)I play genshin wayy more often so make sure to download it rn!!!!!!",5
"Genshin is pretty good for the most part besides the amount of storage it takes (around 16 Gg I think now) and everyone who is complaining about building characters and crap, that is what the game is‚Ä¶ they make it hard to build them so you take more time and endgame content there really is nothing but lately after chasm it gave players something to do, plus 2.8 reruns and then right after Sumeru I think people need to understand you can‚Äôt just do updates every single day then people will miss out on everything i think that some things could be changed but overall it‚Äôs a great game highly recommend",4
"I‚Äôm disappointed in how certain regions like Liyue and Inazuma are carefully researched and put a lot of effort to accurately and respectfully represent (mostly Han) Chinese and Japanese culture, but with Sumeru - a singular nation that turns Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures into a monolith - the characters from NPCs to other upcoming characters are not only shown to not show any sign of the cultures the region is based off of, but the bare minimum of showing darker skinned characters implicates that Hoyoverse can take the culture and aesthetics of South Asian and Middle Eastern culture while spitting at its people, messaging that darker skin isn‚Äôt valuable to them. 

With Hoyoverse pledging that they want to expand to global audiences, they need to understand that if they are to base elements of their game of cultures from other parts of the world, they need to treat those cultures and people with respect.",1
I wont give it one star because the game is amazing. (I havent played it but ive seen it and it looks amazing) But the reason i wasnt able to play it is it takes up way too much storage. (Yes i know so many reviews on this alreadyy but its a serious problem) At first i was like ok i actually dont have that much space so i deleted some photos and got rid of like 5 gb BUT IT STILL WOULDNT LET ME GET THE FULL VERSION. The game looks amazing i dont thing it deserves 1 star but i just cant play the game. Its annoying how much storage it takes up like im not deleting all of the things i play everyday just for one app. Its just not worth downloading. I saw a review to put it on the nintendo switch and honestly that would be a great idea. Maybe this kind of game just isnt meant for mobile.,2
it is a very good game. The details in the graphics and the characters and the action and everything in the game is absolutely wonderful. This is definitely an addicting game. I I love it a lot I play a lot and feel like i need to play because it‚Äôs amazing but only thing that I say that I don‚Äôt like about the game that for star glitter you have to use in intertwined fate to get star glitter and hope that you get 4 to 5 star items to give you more star glitter  but you end up doing the same thing over and over in order to get what you want I don‚Äôt like that part about the game but overall amazing detail amazing everything.,4
"I love to play this game when I first got it. I think it was only 5 or 6 gb. I eventually climbed to Ar 40 and got bored. I decided to take a break so I deleted Genshin but after 2 years. I come back to the game it takes 15 GB!!!! My mobile is only 32gb and I can‚Äôt possibly get any other apps if I want to play Genshin. I have deleted all the apps I could but still couldn‚Äôt play, I really hate it since I have to delete so much stuff everytime to play it then after I cant get any of the apps back. I really hate this game for that, I hope you guys can lower the gb so I can play but if you guys can‚Äôt then I can only play another game that will suit me and won‚Äôt take so much gb. Thank you",3
"if you like breath of the wild GET THIS. This game is full of quests, awesome areas, and interesting characters. The landscape is beautiful and well thought out, the cities are breath taking, and the characters are super fun to play and get to know. I love that every character has their own backstory and personality. ALSO you don‚Äôt have to spend money to play. I‚Äôm completely free to play and even though i don‚Äôt have all the characters or weapons it‚Äôs still so much fun to work towards getting my characters leveled up. if you have the space and time, PLEASE try this game out!!",5
"I absolutely love this game, but could you make a feature to trade characters with friends? My sister and I both have the game and we want to trade characters. Could you also maybe make it so you can get primogems with mora? I know it might make an easy way to get them, but for most quests they are too hard. For example, fighting the Raiden shogun. I have level 60 and 70 characters, but she just absolutely destroys them. Even if I brought a healer or ate food mid battle they would die. She has too much health. I get she is powerful, but could you make it a little easier? Thanks.",5
"Hello!! I just want to start off by saying this is a great game and everything but I‚Äôm having a bit of an issue some quests are to hard to do alone especially if you have a time limit to finish beating the mobs for example in the quest ‚Äúexplore and unlock the tri-seal‚Äù the monster with the shield is to hard to beat alone with the time limit of I want say 2 minutes. I‚Äôve probably been in the first tribe for about two hours trying to beat the mob but find myself unable to beat it, and I do not have any friends to join me and help me out to finish the quest. But I still believe it‚Äôs a very cool and fun game just sometimes frustrating.",4
"I love genshin and it deserves 5 stars but there is something that definitely needs to be fixed 
So I got genshin a little bit ago and I‚Äôve been playing but I also realized my friends play aswell and to keep this short they play in a different server so I can‚Äôt play with them unless I join the server but sadly if u join the server u can‚Äôt use ur old data and u have to start the game over on that server now I know it might not be a big deal and this probably won‚Äôt be noticed but please fix it because I can‚Äôt play with my friends unless I start over again",5
"So I finished the Tsurumi Island quest and did all the puzzles in the quest to get ride of the thick fog and today I logged into Genshin to find out that all my progress and hard work was thrown out the window to never return. Now I‚Äôm here sitting down to write this as a game issue, like what happens to all the hard work I spend hour doing all of that just to log back and and start at square one. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the game until now I really like the game but if the game is gonna do that to me I don‚Äôt find the point of playing and redoing everything I just did. I hope the developers can fix this problem so other people don‚Äôt have to go through this like I had to.",3
"I don‚Äôt know where to begin. This game is one of the few games that I truly enjoy. I have played for one year and still can recall the day I downloaded this game. I saw ads everywhere about Genshin and I thought I should try it out, I honestly thought the game ads would look nothing like the game but I was wrong.. I stepped into the world of Teyvet filled with wonder and mystery not knowing how much joy this game would bring me. You can get lost in the woods, defeat a dragon, or find your lost sibling. Whatever it may be I hope you find as much joy as I do when I play this game.",5
"Hello MiHoYo! I still give this a 5 star rating because the anniversary rewards weren‚Äôt that bad. They give you a multi, eventually 1000 primos, wind glider, namecard, and furniture for your pot. I recommend having a better security system to get rid of hackers and a give a apology for the first anniversary rewards. Also, please bring back the beginner rewards with 1600 gems. I am stillvery grateful for you guys when you brought my hacked acc back! Maybe just bring back the beginners rewards back and the old pity system-? Still, I recommend this game!",5
"At first the game draws you in with its beautiful music, world exploration, and interesting characters. Then the hooks of the gacha system sink in at the end game, and the veil of something beautiful is torn away to reveal something toxic, greedy, and grabbing for your wallet. Mihoyo does not take any criticism and implement fixes in their game, they drip feed content, there‚Äôs no roadmap, and the end game is non-existent. This game has won multiple awards, the community has given so much to this game, yet Mihoyo gives back the bare minimum after becoming one of the most successful mobile games on the market. I‚Äôve dedicated too much time and money to this game, but with the lack of communication and transparency from its own developer it‚Äôs all a complete waste where the player is left feeling like just another number in their analytics and sales.",1
"Mihoyo does not care about its player base only their profit. They do not care for player feedback. They release characters with broken interactions and don‚Äôt bother to fix it, they just change the tooltip to fit the broken interaction. Some old characters are very overpowered but they have been releasing characters that are comparatively average. How does that feel good as a player? Characters only become powerful when you spend $200 or more to upgrade them. Story also shows a lack of effort/rushed decisions. There are many issues with this developer and you should play something else before diving into it. It is sad because this game had a lot of potential, but after so many let downs the game is not going into a great direction. The player base is collectively frustrated",1
If I didn‚Äôt genuinely love this game and everything it has to offer I would of left months ago since the day I downloaded it months ago it would crash every 4-7 minutes (yes I timed it) and it would take a good 5 minutes to load honestly it was ridiculous and now I can‚Äôt even load the game because it kicks me out??? The only reason I‚Äôm giving this 2 stars is because the art work and story telling is phenomenal and I would recommend it to anyone that‚Äôs not playing on iOS lest they get the same trouble I have and so many iOS users have. Minhoyo if a whole device platform isn‚Äôt able to play your game then why is it accessible to Apple? If all were going to get is this? I‚Äôm disappointed.,2
"So what happend is I decided to log out of my brothers Facebook account. And then I forgot my dad downloading Facebook on my device, because his phone is broke. So when I logged back in I saw that I was in my dads Facebook. I tried so many ways but failed. If you see this mihoyo, please tell me what I can do to get back into my brothers Facebook and log into my account please!:( I was ar19. Unlocked all of the maps but then it turned out to be an shame to. If you can help me please do! I‚Äôm really sad. Just to see everyone play but not me, please help me mihoyo.. I‚Äôm just having struggles with everything hope you can help me. Thank you. -xoxo-",4
"It‚Äôs really good but one thing I find annoying is that the archon quests and story quests are really long like I understand why it‚Äôs long but try to make them a little shorter. My second thing is that farming for primogems are hard and take really long. My last small complaint is that the anemoculus and geoculus are kinda hard to get (only some are) and some of them aren‚Äôt even here. 

But overall this is a really good game, the graphics are amazing the lore, the manga and character background are really interesting, the fighting are cool and elegant especially Eulas, the enemy‚Äôs and bosses are good. The voices are really nice, the voice actors/actresses did amazing.",4
"I just downloaded this game for my iPad and I am SO in LOVE with the graphics and story line! The controls are simple to use but the joy con and camera is a bit too touchy, I would like to see an option to adjust it for each players unique needs. However it‚Äôs not the end of the world that you can‚Äôt. The thing I DO NOT like is the game keeps crashing out on me!!!!!! The GREAT thing is that I don‚Äôt loose any data when it does crash so that‚Äôs a huge bonus for me. Over all a good RPG game to download and play just needs some tweaks for the crashing bit. Would like to see more custom options to personalize your character but again not a deal breaker for the game.",4
The entire character system is heavily geared toward paying for a chance to get a character and other than that if you play any multiplayer part with randoms half of them are teleporting around or have ohko and they dont seem to do anything about it. I left a match someone was teleporting around in a stupid side gimmick and it bans me. Really dumb to inhibit someone who got caught seconds after the hunter is freed to not go into another match because they left. I really liked the gameplay but not trying to get characters or anything online related. Those two things are awful.,5
This game takes it to a whole other level and clearly out classes all other rpg type phone games. Even as a phone game the graphics look like it‚Äôs not and the story is so interesting  and immersive I really love how this game turned out. It is a rpg game I have been trying to look for and it is free roam so you don‚Äôt have to teleport or go to an area and wait for things to load. Did I mention there are events to help you get better swords and heroes and different heroes have different abilities. I also love how you can find places to buff up your characters and the gliding in this game is pretty cool I can‚Äôt wait to get more into it.,5
"First off, I want to say I love this game! It has a huge world to explore, fun gameplay mechanics, and cool plot line. The game is certainly playable with the characters you can get for free. However, PLEASE improve the gacha rates! It hurts my soul to see people spending 4000+ dollars for one character!! I really want Diluc but the odds are just so insanely low that I can‚Äôt even try for it! My suggestion would be to perhaps add a sparking system where after a certain number of pulls you could choose which character to get (like Fire Emblem Heroes). I would totally spend money if I had a guaranteed Diluc after a certain amount. But right now, the rates are just abysmally low if you want a particular character.",4
"Woah! This game really packs a punch! It‚Äôs graphics are awesome and I would even say it‚Äôs prettier than Breath of the Wild. I love how when you climb onto a tall mountain you can see way into the distance and it still looks pretty. The map is HUGE and I‚Äôm even struggling getting to all the different areas because there is just so much to do(though in my book that‚Äôs not a bad thing). As for characters, it‚Äôs fun to switch and use the different elements, plus with the gacha mechanic it‚Äôs always exciting getting new ones. The down side I guess would be when you do a 10 pull and it‚Äôs only weapons üòÖ. Having a lot of fun with this game!",5
"It‚Äôs great! I get to experience the open world feel right from my phone. Most games I find on mobile don‚Äôt have a very good open world system. Before, if I wanted to just explore, I‚Äôd have to get a game on pc or switch. But now I don‚Äôt have to. And I really like the fact that I can link my account so that I can also play on pc if I want. While still having all my stuff from Mobile. There are some problems with mobile, like the game will randomly close on me. If I‚Äôm fighting a boss or something, all the damage I‚Äôve dealt will go away, while all the damage to me stays, when I reopen the app. That seems to be the only problem for me tho. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great game.",4
"I love this game and I play it pretty much everyday because it‚Äôs so beautiful. However, I makes my phone like burning hot. Even with the graphic settings lowered all the way down. It‚Äôs kinda uncomfortable when my hands get sweaty because how hot my phone gets. Also, with how close your thumbs are to the characters special skill, I‚Äôve constantly wasted my special skill because of it so it‚Äôs kinda annoying. In my opinion, playing with a controller is so much easier than playing straight from my phone. If this game had controller support, this game would literally be an absolute 11/10 despite my bad luck with the gacha.",5
"I just downloaded this game and when I am playing I am noticing that the sky is black and the ocean. I can‚Äôt see anything in front of me. I am on mobile playing this and I would like for this problem to be fixed ASAP so that I can have a better game play. And also, when it says select a twin.  I couldn‚Äôt even see the twins and ended up picking the boy! I wanted the girl character! I can‚Äôt even see when monsters are coming. It is also laggy and I hate that! Other than that, I‚Äôd say the game is good I guess. Please fix these problems!",5
"Hello! This app is really amazing. I had never expected to get it in the first place, but I guess it grew on me. Such amazing graphics and gameplay, probably my favorite RPG. But, for some odd reason I‚Äôve had this weird glitch where it doesn‚Äôt load me in, the screen just stays white and It won‚Äôt let me play this game. This happened after I installed IOS 14.1. I am a but confused if this was from the update or a glitch. I‚Äôve tried to re-install it but nothing has worked. I really hope this is fixed and I will be able to play Genshin Impact on my IPad again.",5
"I‚Äôve wanted to play this game for so long! I discovered it a couple weeks ago, or maybe longer, because of a bunch of advertisements I saw online! Also, I‚Äôve heard many goods things about this game, so I wanted to give it a try! I tried downloading it on multiple devices, but for some reason, it would load up and then turn to a black/white screen and glitch me out of the app. I also tried getting on to pc, but still, there is a lot of glitches and the audios and sound would cut out from time to time. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem, though either way, I hope the creators would add some things that can help with this, but for now, I‚Äôll just dream about playing lolol~",3
Not really ruined experience but my experience is not what I wanted it to be. First cutscenes are glitchy and don‚Äôt play as they should. Second I can play the for a little bit but then the game just crashes. I really hope you guys read this and fix this. P.s the device I‚Äôm playing should be good enough to play on this device and storage is good. Right now this game is good but the crashing it really annoying because I play for about 5 to 10 minutes then the game just crashes and after that I do something else. I would love to invest more time into the game but I can‚Äôt if half the time I play the game just crashes. I will give it 5 star when the crashes stop.,4
Genshin impact is one of the best games I have played on mobile in a long time it‚Äôs shocking how such a large and expansive world with AAA qualities can be one here. But that is one of the problems I have with the game as the game tends to crash for me in the heat of battle or in important moments. I have completed chapter 1 already and I‚Äôve had over 3 crash‚Äôs I hope the dev team and find a way to patch the crash problem soon. Besides that my other problems with the game are pretty minor like lip sync and NOT BEING ABLE TO PET THE DOGS please let us pet the dogs besides that the games great,5
"Genshin Impact completely raises the bar when it comes to mobile games.  While also launching on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Windows, the mobile release provides the same, full experience.

The lovingly detailed graphics can be cranked to max on an iPhone 10 (other experiences may be different), and the music is extremely well done throughout.  Surprisingly enough, the English voiceovers are also quite competent (something that‚Äôs almost unheard of when it comes to anime style games).

Impressively, progression is stored in real-time.  Regardless of when the game is closed (aside from cutscenes), it will always resume at that exact location (along with every carried item) the next time it‚Äôs launched.

The vast, magical world features a massive amount of content already.  Exploring it is a joy, and I genuinely look forward to how it will continue to grow from here.

(Side note: Once the controller mapping and full screen resolution are fixed for the PC, I‚Äôll be continuing my adventures on there as well.)",5
"The game doesn‚Äôt work at all on iPad devices, and yes it‚Äôs the game not the device. Other iPad users has experienced the same thing, many, many users. I have this game on my phone , and it works perfectly. Thought I would play on my iPad to take in the full scenery, but no. The title screen is always completely black and my character cant see five feet ahead of them. On top of a blinding light that distracts users from seeing anything.  Please fix this I really want to play this seemingly amazing game. When these problems are fixed, my review will go 5 stars.",5
"Hi! I have been playing Genshin Impact for around a year now and it is my go to game when I am bored. For a quick way to sum it up, Genshin is an open world rpg that revolves both around story and combat alike. If you are a quick learner and financially responsible, 100% must download. It is very accessible to play, even for a person who doesn't spend money on games. I have spent around 100 dollars on this game, and I gotta say, that I don't regret a single dollar of that. The only way I would say that you SHOULDNT download is if you don't want to spend money but you are also easily influenced by things telling you to spend money.",4
"I have this game installed on both my iPhone and my PC, and I gotta say, the experience feels native on both versions. The UI is easily transferred from mobile to desktop and the gameplay itself is nearly perfect. I would be hard pressed to say I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the quality. This isn‚Äôt just a port of a pc game on mobile, or vice-versa. This is a gaming experience built for each device it‚Äôs released on, and it‚Äôs stunning to boot. From the quests, to the world design, this game could very well be mistaken as the product of AAA development. Oh, and I love how I can play on my PC, and pick up where I left off on-the-go.",5
"I saw the add and it looked AMAZING üòª so I asked my mom if I could get it and she said yes, but when I opened the app it said I didn‚Äôt have enough space so I went out and cleared at least half of my Photos out and half of my games then I went back in and it said I still needed more space so I got rid of more pictures and more games and it said it still needs more space I did this all day. My mom even got rid of all my photos and put them on her laptop for safekeeping and it still needed more space. Every time I went in it said the same thing and it wouldn‚Äôt let me play even though there was not a problem at all. I tried everything and nothing worked. I bet if I could have play the game it would‚Äôve been awesome but I couldn‚Äôt so that‚Äôs why I give it one star ‚≠êÔ∏è",1
"As you've read the title. A 5 star! This game is really unique!! I love the graphics and mostly everything. I must be the luckiest person though, Want ti know my reason? Well‚Ä¶ i got yaoyo which shes not a bad character and I got dori. Yang wong (I forgot how to spell the name so sorry if I spell it wrong) and others on just a few 1 pulls!! This game is like a comfort game for me. Though its tough to beat the game. But you enjoy it at the same time! If your gonna download this game, you should. The graphics are good the storylines everything is very well made. Thank you for whoever is reading this! Have a great day!",5
"This game is beautiful. The graphics are amazing if you have a good pc or mobile device. My only problem with the game is that with the game being so detailed with lots of graphics, makes it so when every update comes around it takes up so much storage on my phone. I know a phone really isn't suitable but i love this game and thats all i've got. Im at the point where its taken over 20 GB and i was forced to delete apps and photos, im just afraid of having to delete the app itself. This reason, for all mobile players, is the end for us and its so annoying. Especially with all these new constant updates!",4
I‚Äôve been playing the game since February 2021 and I can confidently say that this is a great game and I‚Äôve enjoyed almost all my time playing it. Unfortunately I have to delete the game because of how much storage it was taking up I have 64 gb and the game took over 30 gb with the new update. I‚Äôm sorry I really do enjoy this game but 30 gb?? That‚Äôs insane. I do hope that I will be able to play again in the near future and that hoyoverse will solve this storage issue. I really do love this game it‚Äôs honestly a shame that I am being forced to delete it. So in other words please fix your storage issue,4
"genshin is simply amazing, the graphics, the extensive character backgrounds, the lore that is found in every item. i believe it has so much potential to be the best open world game with a few minor tweaks in the gacha system regarding primogems and such. it is very difficult to obtain primogems in late game without doing events or buying them but i guess that‚Äôs the point lol. i do wish the xp books were more available to late game players but if you grind for a bit its really no problem. i love this game and i will continue to play for as long as my phone storage will let me.",5
"Genshin impact is an amazing game, the wishing system, plot, the characters backstory‚Äôs, all of the lore is amazing trust me. All of the new locations are very fun to explore and very interesting to play. the quests are super fun again everything is doing well. Yet there are a few cons to the game. you have to have a large Gigabyte iPhone, tablet, any device or you cannot play. it takes up 3GB once u download it. but once you do the whole thing it takes up about 15-30GB and it‚Äôs super annoying. Everyone just wants to enjoy a game where they can freely play it without always getting a notification where they have to much storage or not enough storage for anything. I would really wish if it was fixed. After all a great game.",2
"While i‚Äôve loved this game for over 6 months, the lack of diversity in characters body types & skin tones has been very disappointing to say the least. but to make matters worse, Hoyoverse is seemingly incapable of taking criticism on it and fixing their mistakes. 

They claim to take inspiration from real life places, which i find really amazing! it‚Äôs one of my favorite parts seeing little aspects of places being put into the game. What i hate is that they‚Äôre making ALL characters pale aside from a select few. When they‚Äôre emailed about this, they say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll forward this to the correct department‚Äù. This may be true but they are definitely NOT listening right now. 

Hoyoverse, please listen to your players. I love your game and i don‚Äôt want to leave but this has been such a disappointment. Do better",1
"Due to the recent leaks of characters from the sumeru region I would say it‚Äôs pretty safe to say they should have made the characters from this region have darker skin, especially since each region in the game is based off a place in the world, (for example: mondstadt is based on Germany, Liyue on china, and inazuma on Japan) sumeru is based on South Asia so if they were to actually represent the people from there they would have made them have darker skin. Not to mention that Genshin already lacks in having diversity, this would have been their chance to add some. I‚Äôm rather disappointed in hoyoverse for having not made the sumeru characters have darker skin. I can only hope that when they do officially release them, hoyoverse would have listened to people and changed their skin tones.",1
genshin impact is a overal great game with its amazing graphics and bosses. although some downsides are that you can spend days upon days trying to get enough primogems to wish but end up getting nothing. this can be very challenging and very annoying if you have been playing with the same characters for months. Another problem is how much storage it takes up. for mobile players this took up about a quarter of my storage (20/64) and adding all the pictures and other apps i had i had to delete them to play. I think that this game can have some potential if you fix some of these issues.,4
"Genshin at first was confusing for me and it may be the same for new users but everything about it makes sense eventually. The way the game is made makes you want to play it more maybe to build a character, farm for a character, and to complete all sorts of things so in the end there‚Äôs nothing you can‚Äôt do when bored because there‚Äôs always something you can do. Hopefully every player has the same enjoyable experience as me but the only con as I‚Äôm a mobile is the amount of storage it takes‚Ä¶ either way it‚Äôs still enjoyable! :)",5
"I love this game so much. It is so fun to play and there‚Äôs always something to do. I have played all day long and I still wouldn‚Äôt be bored. The only ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù I would possibly make is maybe having a completely customizable character. Like gender, skin color, hair, eyes, name, and weapon/ability. Having a character that looks like me would be so cool. And maybe have a set multiplayer world where you can interact with all the players at once instead of visiting their world. Also, is there a voice option on genshin? Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to type in the middle of battle when you want to say something.",4
I‚Äôm still going to give this a five stars because the only reason a downloaded it is because I have seen many ads and videos on it. I am unsatisfied though because when I tried installing it it installed halfway and instantly finish. When I went to click on it it just start downloading again. Then I found a button called ‚Äústart download‚Äù while it was downloaded I clicked it and it finished the loading the catch was I could not click on it. I also deleted it and reinstalled it still would not work.,5
"I played when the game first came out and enjoyed it. But my old phone wasn‚Äôt cut out for the game. I recently got a new IPhone so I wanted to come back to it and see what‚Äôs new‚Ä¶. But I cannot figure out my account login and the process of getting it back has been such a buzzkill. I‚Äôve never had this frustrating of an experience with any game before. 

I don‚Äôt know the in-depth specifics that support wants from me. And apparently there‚Äôs no email associated with the account‚Äî ?? That‚Äôs a poor design choice to not have the customer bind the account to‚Äî well‚Ä¶ anything. 

What I do have, however, is my friend who has me in their friends list so I know exactly which account is mine. But I‚Äôve accepted I‚Äôm not getting it back so purely F2P new account for me. Im not wasting anymore money here.",1
"I want to like this game, I really do. But every time they release an update, it seems to just cost more storage for my iPad, which is the only device I can play on because I don‚Äôt have a PC or a PlayStation and after the game being released for well over a year, there is STILL no announcements or plan (to my knowledge) to release a MacBook version for us apple users. I have way more storage on my laptop than my iPad (which I cannot change) and it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. I want to play this game, but not at the expense that I‚Äôm having to make as much room for it as I already have. I‚Äôm really disappointed and wish miHoYo would hurry up with that Mac release. Until, I‚Äôm just offloading or deleting the app. It‚Äôs just not worth it anymore.",1
"By far best mobile game when it comes to content. It could be easier to get legendary characters, legends equipment, also damage is questionable. It makes it so you have to grind you character, artifacts and weapon as well as find items (that are spread out over a massive map)  which takes A LOT of time . Other than that I like the game. To summarize. Make it easier to get newer characters that are garbage. When we get those characters atleast start them off at the adventure rank the player is at. Make it easier to get weapons artifacts and items to ascend and upgrade. Or make it so we get more per pickup.",4
"Overall, Genshin impact is an amazing game with great fighting mechanics and a great story. I absolutely love the characters and the ability to change them while in combat, or whenever else. I honestly wish there were more things to do in multiplayer, as many quests are blocked and really the only things you can do is fight monsters while in multiplayer. Other than that, I love everything about the game, from the wishing system to the style of the characters and monsters. If you‚Äôre looking for an enjoyable game to play, this is it.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since day 1. In the whole year I‚Äôve been playing, I‚Äôve missed 2 days. I really enjoy this game. But between working, and life in general, its getting harder to make it through content. Which means I‚Äôm missing out on events. I‚Äôm not the only one, new players are experiencing this as well. Please don‚Äôt lock events behind completing world quests. It makes it hard to really enjoy the game when you feel like you‚Äôre having to rush things in your spare time. This game isn‚Äôt meant to be rushed, you should be able to experience it at your own pace, and not miss out on rewards and materials. Please reconsider how events are done in the future.",3
"I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying that I play the game every day, and I no longer play on mobile because the PC version is objectively better. I rerolled my account fifty times in March to get Hu Tao, and I‚Äôve played every day since. I haven‚Äôt spent any money on the game, so this will be from a F2P player‚Äôs standpoint.

Genshin Impact is the best gacha game that currently exists. It‚Äôs disguised as an open-world RPG, and for people who pull good characters, it‚Äôs just that. I was fortunate enough to pull Xingqiu and Zhongli, Hu Tao‚Äôs best supports, within two months of playing the game. If I didn‚Äôt have them, I probably wouldn‚Äôt still be playing. Without a good team, it‚Äôs unbelievably hard to progress quickly. And unless you spend money, you  basically need to play the game daily and do every event in order to get a good team.

And that isn‚Äôt all. The newer, non-rerun banners contain characters that you can‚Äôt even build until you progress through the story. In other words, it‚Äôs really hard to get into the game.

Take it from a gacha veteran. There are better ways to get entertainment than a daily grind, gamble-heavy, fake RPG. I‚Äôll continue to play, though. What a hypocrite I am.",1
"I‚Äôm not into fighting games or games with a lot of grind but my SO is. I‚Äôm more into puzzle and adventure games. He‚Äôs been playing this a lot and while it‚Äôs very aesthetically pleasing, I got bored watching. So I decided go download it myself and I‚Äôve been getting a bit more into it. I‚Äôm still not into watching girls in tights run around and the English voice actors annoyed me so I just changed it to Japanese. I don‚Äôt have a gaming system so I‚Äôm glad there‚Äôs an app and now my SO and I can play together and I won‚Äôt be bored! Lol. Forreal tho it‚Äôs a nice game.
I can‚Äôt stand the moaning the characters make when they climb or get hit. Especially the younger characters. Rubs me the wrong way. But still a fairly fun game.",4
"The game it‚Äôs is AMAZING and really enjoyable. The graphics and controls are so good, hard to believe it‚Äôs on mobile. The story is great, and so is the combat system. Although‚Ä¶ the game doesn‚Äôt feel complete. I‚Äôd say some pvp or duel mode would be great since it could get a bit boring here and there. Everything else is perfect, Keep up the good work!! The game isn‚Äôt pay to win btw, you just have to put in the time and effort which will pay off at the end :) 

Edit: forgot to mention, the game does take up quite a lot of storage but in my opinion, it‚Äôs totally worth it.",5
"The game is great. You will have fun playing it unless you are someone that expects to be given everything. Those those are the ones that recently gave one star. 

The game gives free roaming around the world. You can do just the dailies and use your resin in about an hour however you can also get lost in the world for hours of gameplay. 

The game also can be multi player after Adventure rank 16. Up to 3 other players can join your world or you can join other worlds. There is no pvp which is a relief because not everyone wants that. 

You can easily play this game for free. The grind is not bad at all. With that being said this game is worth at least a normal game price with the content provided. 

Don‚Äôt believe any one star ratings that came out around the anniversary date of the game. Pretty much just fake reviews. You get a lot of free stuff from events throughout the year. The company isn't greedy it is the players that are.",5
"Mihoyo might be one of the stingiest company‚Äôs i‚Äôve ever seen. You are a MILLION dollar company and the best you could for anniversary rewards was 40 primogems and a log in event?! i‚Äôm disappointed. I was so hype for the rewards but HONKAI‚Äôs rewards were better than this and it was made by the same company. Smh, literally one of the worst company‚Äôs i‚Äôve come across, NOT TO MENTION the way you silence your audience and take away the only thing that helped F2P players out (the leakers). Without leakers, the game got boring fast. The events are decent but if you had a roadmap planned out for characters banners you could have made so much more people play it, knowing when your favorite character comes out helps out a lot of F2P players. But NoOOooOooooo, Mihoyo is just another dumb company i‚Äôm tired of playing your games anyways. Mihoyo do betterüòë",1
"The anniversary rewards are absolutely horrendous. I‚Äôm a day 1 player, I‚Äôve been here through so many terrible droughts but I‚Äôd genuinely prefer a rerun of some random event that like 3 people played than whatever this trash you call ‚Äúanniversary rewards‚Äù are. 10 wishes for a year of support from your community. 10 wishes is all you can give us for making a gacha game you expected to last a few months explode was a chance to get a decent character. We can‚Äôt even start to talk about Kokomi and the absolute copium and hopium going on with her release. Why is ever character you‚Äôve released with Inazuma was fundamentally flawed entirely. Melee character with a gimicky dash nigh pointless. Yoimiya being just unfun. A character who can‚Äôt do basic functions of others. Make this better before we find something better.",1
"Don't get me wrong, this game is beautiful, but they don't care about their community. Not once since launch have they truly taken to account what the community has said/wants. On top of this, the 1 year anniversary. Out of the millions that play your game, for your anniversary only 1000 of us have the amazing chance of receiving a measly $1 worth of the gems you‚Äôre giving out? G r e a t. Not to mention how ridiculous the new log in event is. 10 fates(summoning currency) sure but again, time gated, like literally everything else. Take a fellow member of the community‚Äôs feedback for once and go look at all of the forms you make us fill out every month and go listen to your feedback. These log in rewards aren‚Äôt even rewarding. I don‚Äôt even want to log in.",1
"sometimes it might kick u out of the loading screen if u don‚Äôt have like 10GB to play edit: just started playing it and it‚Äôs pretty good, only complaint is that it crashes whenever i try to enter a dungeon or temple whatever u call it, and sometimes when im opening a menu, but other than that the game has a solid story! i just wish primogems were easier to getüòî also the characters are very hot my fav is kaeya. also when is it coming out on switch? ill have a much easier time playing it on there.",5
"Let me just say this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. I can find nothing like it and it is incredibly enjoyable. The only critique I have is it is such a big game, taking up a large part of storage and is a high power game so it can crash many times during gameplay, they also have yet to add the game to Xbox and switch which is also inconvenient for some users. Other than some of the crashing problems on mobile I have no problem playing the game and I love it, just wish they could add it on other platforms and fix the crashing.",5
"This is the BEST GAME/APP ON THE PLANET! I am not kidding the graphics are amazing, the characters look amazing, the quests are awesome, YOU CAN FLY/GLIDE, but I ONLY have 2 things I would like to critique 1: make more opponents to get characters or make more of the money things to buy the things to get characters. 2: make the camera go further. If you had read this far WOW! I haven‚Äôt written a response this long but I had a lot of things to say but thanks for reading and I recommend Genshin Impact to everyone. It‚Äôs supper addictive and amazing but company if you are reading this pls change or help me with those!",5
"This game is amazing! It has wonderful graphics and it‚Äôs really interactive. For all the new players out there, I highly recommend this game! I play in the iPad and aside from glitching during the cutscenes it‚Äôs very detailed and really fun! I see many people complain about not getting certain characters which brings down the game rating, but that‚Äôs part of the fun! You won‚Äôt aways get who or what you want but it doesn‚Äôt take away the fun! You get the fight monsters, and go on quests and gain XP. It‚Äôs super interactive and you get to explore so much! I can‚Äôt wait till all seven domains are out!",5
I actually play on PC more but the fact that I can supplement my progress (progress is saved in the cloud) with iPhone app that is 100% just as capable is amazing. Really the only limitation on the mobile app is the real estate on the screen. I play on an SE (2020) and almost prefer it mobile if not for the main joystick (touch for fine tuned aiming is much better than right-joystick aiming IMO and a lot of the touch oriented features do work better on iPhone than PC). As long as you don‚Äôt intend on destroying your battery with intended play sessions on mobile then I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. So good.,5
"Developers, please read this. I always stop at the intro because of how laggy it is it might be because my ipad is old, maybe my bad storage, maybe both. i doubt its the game‚Äôs fault but i want to know the game works before i actually play it. the game is really beautiful though, and other people seem to love it. also it takes a lot of storage space so if lack of storage is the problem would it be possible to make the game smaller? i understand how difficult that might be but if it‚Äôs possible id be glad if you can do that. anyway seems like a great game!",5
"The design and mechanics of the game are what caught my attention, the theme is quite lively. Not only that, but the storyline and the dialogues are colorful, as well. Some games have storylines that are too hard to follow or too boring to listen thoroughly to, however so far, the storylines of this game are quite entertaining, something straight out of an anime. I also really enjoy the fact that this isn‚Äôt much of a buy to win game, you can buy certain things, of course, but with the right amount of hours put into the game one can enjoy it just as well. One thing I do hope the developers add to this game is the ability to play with a separate Bluetooth controller.",4
"I‚Äôve put...idk... 10 maybe 15 hours into this game, and it literally has not left me bored or with lack of things to do. Even when you are restricted by level to access certain story missions, there about a million other things you can be doing to keep moving forward. I also found a way to finally check what kind of progress I‚Äôm making, and I‚Äôve only covered 37 percent of the map. Genshin is about as flawless as you can get when it comes to a mobile game. I don‚Äôt even play my ps4 anymore because I‚Äôm picking up my phone every chance I get to play Genshin impact!",5
"I just got this game looking at the reviews, it sounds epic! I‚Äôm super hyped to play it! I downloaded it, opened the app, and it put me on a freaking white screen for a long time. I never actually got to play the game, because it just stayed on the white screen. I made a lot of storage available on my iPad, I even re downloaded the game I cant even count how many times. And my iPad is an iPad Pro, it shouldn‚Äôt glitch like this. My iPad isn‚Äôt broken, it‚Äôs the game. Please consider fixing this! I can‚Äôt rate this, cause I‚Äôve never played (sadly) but I‚Äôll give it a five star to be nice. Please try and fix this. By the way, this is mobile. Thanks!",5
"I really do like this game but it‚Äôs just not working out. I have tried play on my laptop but it doesn‚Äôt seem to play for a good amount of time. Once I login in and play, it then proceed to kick me out after 2 mins or just 30 seconds of being in game. Me and friends thought it was because of my laptop but everything seems to be fine. I then switch to my iPad which it does say very compatible to my iPad. So I downloaded it, seems fine but then as I get to the world, it is all black. I can see the paimon menu and everything but it the scenery and background that is black. I really hope this gets fixed because I really like the game, from the story‚Äôs to the voice acting and all it‚Äôs cute characters.",3
"Genshin Impact is one of the funnest and most favorite games I‚Äôve ever played. The story is fun (and depending on your choices can be funny too) and the gameplay and controls are good. One of the best things is that you don‚Äôt need good characters to be good and have fun. Actually, one of the things that surprised me was that the loading screen time is fast. However, I think that the co-op mode needs some new functions. Almost everything needs original resin and the map bosses are way too easy. I think that adding temples as co-op options would be a great addition to the game or some other feature that allows my friends and I to grind together and play together more.",4
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Genshin is a great game. It‚Äôs gorgeous, exciting, and fun. But some of the fun goes away after you reach a certain level. From there on out, you are mostly focusing on exploration until the next region comes out. Secondly, f2p opportunities. As a f2p player, I feel that the game doesn‚Äôt have enough opportunities for people who don‚Äôt spend money. The game is f2p friendly, but you have to work for it. I don‚Äôt remember the last time I ever did a ten pull because of how quickly the banners were going and how little primogems I had been collecting from quests, events, spiral abyss, and commissions.",4
"I‚Äôm putting a lot of time in the game on the PS4 and figured I might as well download the game on my phone since I‚Äôm spending a lot of time sitting around and waiting at places. Only problem is I can‚Äôt continue my PS4 save and I‚Äôm not going to invest any meaning time, or money for that matter, on the mobile version of the game when I‚Äôve already done both on the PS4.

And why can I not listen to my own music???? The music in the game isn‚Äôt bad by any means, I‚Äôd just like to listen to my own music.

My rating has nothing at all to do with the game or gameplay though. The game itself is amazing. The pricing is ridiculous but the game is also free so I can let that slide here. Drop rates are horrendous. I get that it‚Äôs a gacha game but c‚Äômon man, be at least a little consumer friendly here.",2
"If you are a fan of anime products or anime games, this is a must-play. If you are a fan of open-world games with beautiful graphics, landscapes and music, this is a must-play. If you are a fan of RPGs, this is a must-play. Hell, if you are even a casual video game player, you NEED to try Genshin Impact. Excellent graphics, music, gameplay, and progression makes for a top-5 game of 2020, whether you play it on mobile, PS4, Windows, or otherwise. It helps to have good storytelling and co-op, too. If I had to nitpick, the game does drop frames at times, especially during drastic lighting changes, but I could hardly justify giving a 4/5 for something like that.",5
"First off, I‚Äôm not a huge gamer. I only like adventure/role playing games and ever since I got an iPhone I‚Äôve been waiting for a game like this to come out! I am absolutely floored with how great this game actually is. The storyline, the graphics, all the little details, and not to mention the absolutely beautiful music and sound design! I could literally play this game all day (which is probably a bad thing) üòÇ Lets just say this is what I‚Äôll be playing every weekend. To end this review off, this is the best game I‚Äôve ever played on iPhone. Superb job to the developers and everyone involved. You‚Äôve really outdone yourselves üëè",5
"In my opinion, this game is amazing! It‚Äôs just what I expected it to be. I‚Äôve been waiting for this game for up to a year now and it‚Äôs finally within my grasps to play. I‚Äôve not gotten off this game since! I love Mihoyo and I‚Äôve been supporting them since Honkai Impact 3rd. Every aspect of this game is like an image of Honkai impact if it was an RPG game. The only downside I have so far with this game is CO-OP mode since you can‚Äôt really do much aside from domains, roaming the world, fight bosses around the map, and do temples. I wish it could‚Äôve been more open to doing missions like story, side quests, and more. Regardless, the game is great!",5
"I love the look and flow of the game! Would be 5 stars if they fix these issues:

1) I can only see about 10 feet around my character and then it‚Äôs pitch black. Makes it so I have to explore almost blind and combat with ranged enemies is a pain.

2) any body of water is pitch black as well and whenever I touch water my character becomes a shining ball of light until a few seconds after I leave the water.

3) kind of a common one for new games, but the app crashes quite a bit and at random it seems.

4) cutscenes are extremely laggy and cut in and out until it runs through the scene.

I have tried all the common fixes to these kind of issues but none have worked. I deleted and downloaded, adjusted both my iPad and game settings, and restarted my iPad each multiple times with no luck. I am really excited for this game and hope they can fix these issues as it is unplayable at this point for me.

Things I love about the game so far are the graphics, the combat system, and the variety in characters! Can‚Äôt wait to play the game as it was meant to be played!",3
"I can easily get board when playing games like Roblox, Minecraft and more, but this? This is what I call epic! I love there background details, the story, and the animations are just chef‚Äôs kiss :) when I first downloaded and discovered this game, I immediately fell in love with it and it‚Äôs one of my favorite video games out there! The updates are pretty epic too! When I even showed my sister this game, she really liked it too and it‚Äôs one her her favorite games as well! Good job Genshin Impact! And thank you for all the hard work and details you guys have put in this game. üëçüëçüòÅüòÅüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I personally enjoy Genshin, but this was before I had this quest that I was forced to do to progress. The light guiding ceremony, where you were forced to battle and save the god. One the last light, I picked up too ‚Äòlights‚Äô and was forced into a timed battle, I completed it but all the lights I had completely de-spawned and never came back or respawned and now I‚Äôm stuck and cannot complete the events that require Co-op that the quest bans. This is really irritating since I used this account a lot and spent a lot of money on it, but overall I enjoy it, but sometimes it gets annoying and troublesome for me to complete. I hope this game gets better overtime, but this is why I enjoy Genshin and still give it 3 stars.",3
"I love this game! It‚Äôs graphics are stunning, and the story is awesome! I also love the design and personality of the characters! The main reason on why I‚Äôm writing this review is because, when I was playing on my Apple account, I decided to restart for a fresh new start. When you unlock wish, you get primo gems and intertwined fates. When I restarted my account and unlocked wish, I got the 11 Acquaint fates it gives you at the begging, but I didn‚Äôt get the primos and Intertwined fates. Is this supposed to happen? Please write back when you have the time.",5
"Genshin is one of my best games I‚Äôve ever played.
I‚Äôve played this game for a long time and the characters, domains, wishing system itself, music, and game storyline are all so executive compared to other games. 
The people who Co-op are almost always kind and leaning a helping hand. 

The only thing I would say this game needs a change is the primo distribution and level-uped AR rewards. 

First the Primos: I feel like more primos are needed. Maybe in the Tree Blessing events in Inazuma and Sumeru can contain primos. Or even something like our Reputation level up to contain primos. That would make the game more affordable for people and gain more attention. 

Second the level-up AR rewards: I would say this is the most unfair part of the game. The rewards for higher level up‚Äôs are unjust. Like when u get to AR60 you only get 3 wishes. It‚Äôs just not worth it. I think the AR level up should contain more rewards. Maybe 10-15 wishes after maxing to AR60 would be nice ^^.",5
"For a while after I downloaded it, I stopped playing because of school but I just got into it again and I love it so much! The draw is 100% luck, no adventure rank or anything taken into it, as it seems many games give better things to higher people. One of my favorite things about this game is the plot/creativity. It has an interesting plot and the creativeness all in all is amazing. The only thing that bothers me is that to be able to continue the story, you have to be a certain rank, it‚Äôs not super high though and I don‚Äôt really mind it, BUT I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DRAGON.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin since January 2021 and I have many mixed feelings about the game. The music, lore, and world design are beautiful and unmatched to any game I‚Äôve played before. However, the game itself does not have much to offer in terms of representation. Granted the current regions are based off of predominantly light skinned areas, the recent leaks of Sumeru have caused an uproar within the community as it was seen as the perfect opportunity to devote a large chunk of the playable characters to people of color. I believe the community and myself would appreciate it greatly if Hoyoverse would consider creating more characters with a darker skintone.",4
"Genshin Impact is a great game don‚Äôt get me wrong, but literally the characters skin now is GLOWING! At least add another character with at least the same as Xinyan because head me out. Xinyan is probably the only character I‚Äôm seeing with a some what dark skin tone and I love her, but the 2.8 characters (Most of the characters) have toooo pale skin and it just glowing. it‚Äôs sad to see that :(. So it would be nice to have like a character with a some what similar skin color like Xinyan because it shows how every character is unique and not all of them pretty much looking the same. (MY OPINION)",5
"Ok, so clearing this up: I ‚ù§Ô∏è THIS GAME! It is so fun, but I have a few pointers. Pointer #1: this game crashes a lot on mobile (although that just might be my version of iPad) and can be very slow 2. Pointer #2: NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS!!!!!!! The age rating is correct, and this game does have some violence in it. Again very fun. Pointer #3: You kind of have to grind for some of the materials. For some characters like (my personal fave) Keqing or Diona, you have to fight monsters that are their element. Pointer #4: NO ENDGAME YET!!!! There is a character in the game that may or may not be evil. I do not know because again NO ENDGAME!!!! Have fun exploring Teyvat.",5
"Overall, this game is by far one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. The graphics are pristine and the voice over is quite good. The storyline gets a bit boring after a bit, but theres always stuff to explore and characters to build.

Speaking of builing characters, many people have spent hundreds of dollars on one character, Yae Miko. Hoyoverse, in the most recent update, have nerfed her just 6 weeks after her release. And If you don‚Äôt know what that means, it means that they practically made her weaker. It also is a gacha gambling game, so DON‚ÄôT SPEND MONEY ON IT! Stay completly Free to Play and enjoy it! Don‚Äôt spend money!

Thanks for reading lol",4
"No end game content- if the resin cap was removed this would solve a good majority of issues. The complete refusal to include characters of different skin tones is unacceptable. The game profits off of using different cultures as inspiration for their regions, yet doesn‚Äôt take the time to model the characters they profit millions of dollars off of past stereotypes. Many would agree that the hype for new content, such as Sumeru, has died knowing hoyo hasn‚Äôt listened at all to its fan base. Redesign these characters. Make a five star with a darker complexion. If profits are the main concern, I can guarantee there are many people who have decided not to spend any money on the Sumeru banners and will stick to that, meaning your profits are going to suffer. I know how easy it is to change the skin tone of a 3D model- just do it. It isn‚Äôt hard.",1
"Genshin Impact has hooked me for several months, and I‚Äôve been glued to it. But for me, genshin is a kinda greedy company. Primogems are way too hard to earn. For example, once you complete an achievement, it only gives you 5 - 20 primogems. I know that ways, people will spend more time on it. But also, 160 primogems just for 1 fate? That‚Äôs way too expensive. And only 980(with another 980 bonus) crystals for 10 in real life money? You can‚Äôt even make 10 wishes with that. And this is why 5 star characters are so hard to get. You should take pity on people.",5
"THIS IS THE BEST GAME IVE PLAYED IN YEARS. It‚Äôs about 2 siblings/twins (Aether and Lumine) who were separated from each other, which made them have to do quests, explore new realms of Teyvat, fighting bosses, monsters, etc. The quests are really fun to do, as well as your emergency food who‚Äôs always there for you, Paimon! Paimon is emergency food who helps you with every quest you do, gives you tutorials on what to do, and a great companion for the experience! All though there are 7 gods and we only know 3, it is for sure worth the wait!<33 (please Hoyoverse I‚Äôm desperate for Yelan I‚Äôve been playing for 1 year and my birthday was the 7th of mayüòïüòï)",5
OK so i love that you have an option to be a boy or girlŸ´ and have many other characters too. And i am not so far into the game as some other people so this review is not as helpful as some others. The game glitches sometimesŸ´ but its still and awsome game! If you love adventures and fightingŸ´ this is perfect for you! I recomend this game. The characters are so detailed and different. And there are tasks to keep you busy one the game. You earn coins and other things like foodŸ´ weapons ect. I just love it.  Thats all i have to say right nowŸ´ and i hope you try it out!,5
"I‚Äôm not really a full f2p I brought a primogem pack twice or three times and brought the battle pass  they were all 1.00 packs though. Let‚Äôs get to the real talk bc I did that ever since then I have been getting a few five stars and I‚Äôve wanted Eula for a while but on both of her reruns I did not get her. I‚Äôm now a Baal main but if I get Diluc, Kazuha or Yae miko I would gladly replace her but even though I got Ganyu I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not going to get them bc I only do one pulls and I don‚Äôt really know how to save in game money and irl money but I would give the game a 5/5 but the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven‚Äôt gotten the characters I really wanted.",4
"the pity, artifact, resin, and leveling system is so stupid. if you were f2p, it would take at least 6 months of saving to get one 5* at 80 pity. nobody would want to spend that much time just to get one character. $100 to get a 5* and it might not even be the character you want is so stupid. AND THE WORST THING EVER IS THE WEAPON BANNER. Why do you have to get 2 points to get your guaranteed weapon??? Why can‚Äôt it be like, once you get the 2 points you will get the weapon you want. It seems totally more fair then being forced to buy that weapon. This game is really good, the graphics and details and characters are amazing it‚Äôs just the system for this game is so stupid and annoying. fix it.",3
"I love the game. I play it on my phone, PC and PS4. The graphics are tasteful and the design is interesting. The cutscenes have improved too! They used to glitch really badly on my phone. But I do have one thing. Paimon is just so annoying on so many levels. I love the banter choices, seriously I do, but why even have a voice actor for the MC if Paimon is going to dominate every single interaction in the worst possible way? I get the interaction bits in character menu but that‚Äôs as far as it went? They couldn‚Äôt even get in the game itself aside from opening chests and fight noises??? I get the cutesy feel but to be honest it just feels overplayed at this point.",4
I love this game cuz it‚Äôs VERY FUN. but it takes up a lot of my storage space and I literally deleted ALL of my apps and photos just to play this game but once I tried updating it it said ‚Äúlack of storage space‚Äù and all of my apps and photos are already deleted so I tried deleting the app and then the storage space went down to 0 and found out it was the app that made it have lack of space but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it‚Äôs a fun game though! Whoever is reading this I highly recommend this game! But if it takes up too much of your space to even download it then you don‚Äôt really need to!,4
"Genshin Impact is probably one of the best RPG games I've ever played. You can unlock new characters without having to spend money, there are new updates every few months with something brand new added to the game, like the Inazuma region or the new Fishing system, and the attention to detail is AMAZING. I have a few problems with it though, such as the anniversary rewards aren't what we(the players) wish it was, there are perks to playing on the PlayStation network that you don't get if you play on PC or mobile, and you can't purchase Genesis Crystals with a Visa gift card on PC. All in all, it's a great game, and I highly recommend it.",4
"This is mostly for people on mobile, because my experience with computer/PC gameplay has been fine. So all my friends tell me to get genshin impact, but I don‚Äôt have a good enough computer to download it, so naturally, I get my phone. First problem is that It took around 5+ hours (likely because is my data) to download fully, and when it finally finishes I get 4 frames of the opening cutscene‚Ä¶ and it gets stuck in loading. I restart the game, I get stuck in loading again. I have nothing against genshin, I actually really love it, but this was really annoying so I thought people should hear about it. Have a good day!",3
"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually writing a review, but the people who complain about this being a gotcha game or a BotW ripoff clearly haven‚Äôt played this.

It‚Äôs a perfectly playable game without spending a single penny. And the visuals/music/story/open world scale/YouTube channel are top tier. More than anything we get from any other free game (aside from League of Legends). Also has that anime style for any weebs out there.

Hot take, but with the newer addition of the lightning island and Serai island, I think this game has surpassed BotW.",5
"If you‚Äôre looking for a game with GOOD characters and story lines THIS IS IT. Everything about this game is amazing- the graphics are absolutely stunning, amazing boss‚Äôs, ways to connect with characters, etc. Usually a game won‚Äôt keep my attention for more than a few weeks, but Genshin has kept me on for 95 days+.. HIGHLY recommended and it‚Äôs very addictive.. I have so much to say about this game but those are the few things that have caught my attention, including the main storyline! I‚Äôm so excited to see how this game turns out at the end of the story with ‚Äútraveler‚Äù and their sibling.",5
This is a Great game I love it it is so fun there are so much cool features to the games like commissions exploring worlds and finding chest and more I also love how you can wish and the pity system that really helps so much and so many cool new characters where is it their own different personality such as klee sayu and Bennett jean Barbara Lisa and more. I have been playing for at least 1 year and I already have so much cool character  all in all I love Genshin so much you should try it out yourself keep up the good work and good luck with the new characters that are coming out I‚Äôm so excited for them.,5
"Look, I really love this game but when ever I try and fight the Maguu Kenki for Kazuha ascension it absolutely pisses me off. Why? Because while I‚Äôm fighting it, it will randomly stop and go back to its position and heal up again. It‚Äôs annoying that I keep have to fight it over and over again until I finally defeated him ONCE. I‚Äôve fought him at least 8 times and out of those 8 times he does the same thing. Once I was fighting him and I was so close to killing him but the next thing I knew he ran past me, sat down, and got back up fully healed and ready to fight again. Everything else in this game is absolutely perfect but that Maguu Kenki.",4
"Genshin Impact offers good music, story, and for the most part characters (with the exception of recent characters such as Yoimiya that are underwhelming). However, to get access to many of these, it is required that the player spends at least an hour a day playing the game. While this would be fine if the rewards for it were worth it, they unfortunately aren‚Äôt most of the time. Pennies worth of in game currency are given for what is days of in game play time at times. Additionally, after playing for one year (>365 days) no notable rewards were given to players outside of what is normally provided in events. This is a greedy game in many ways and the company behind it does not seem to be trying to improve it. For either pay to play or f2p players.",1
"This is overall a great game. Massive world to explore with many objectives to get done. The music is beautiful as with the art style. Only complaints I have is the game crashing. I have a few hours on the game, and it has frozen up or completely crashes 5 times so far. Usually only when a cutscene is about to start or I just completed an objective. So it doesn‚Äôt hinder me from doing anything, like if I were in the middle of a fight. The game loads up quickly, and takes you right back to where you left off. I would rate 5/5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for that. This is an extremely good mobile game that fit my needs after completing Oceanhorn 2",4
"This game is literally so fun and anytime my friends ask what games to play I always suggest Genshin, I got my friend into it and she PASSED ME. That shows me that she enjoys the game lol, overall this game is so cute and fun and has plenty of characters and stories to choose from. I love how you get a challenge and it comes with dialogue and voices to listen to! I also really like how the story lays out perfectly and I love the strategy of this game! I‚Äôve started playing about a mont ago and I‚Äôm already adventure rank 27! I also really enjoy how you can play with friends and family! 10/10 üôÑüí≥üí•üí≥üí•üí≥",5
"It was okay when I first played it, but everything started to get harder for me, and I don‚Äôt believe in the pity system anymore.I bought a ton of wishes, just for the same character and nothing good. I only keep it because my friends play it, and I‚Äôve deleted 12 apps just to use it. I spent MONEY on this game. Grinding is basically impossible and quests are stupidly hard. I‚Äôve even bought 36 wishes, 30 being done in the 10 pull, and I got no character or 5 stars. It was also very laggy. I get it‚Äôs a great game with ‚Äúgreat graphics‚Äù, but I can‚Äôt delete anymore apps.",5
"Although the game is quite fun and beautiful, it takes up approximately 11.5 GB from my phone and with each update it‚Äôs another GB. I have to constantly delete apps and precious photos just to be able to do daily commissions and tedious missions that of course are fun in a sense that the storyline is cool. When a character even comes around you have to spend a lot of primogems just to waste them on useless weapons and characters that you already have. It‚Äôs disappointing that these two problems are the most damaging thing to the mobile app version of this game. It truly is a wonderful game but I will sadly have to delete it since I have no space to update it anymore. üòì",3
"Absolutely one of the best JRPGS Iv ever had the pleasure of playing... It‚Äôs relaxing, addictive and challenging all at the same time. The graphics are just outstanding and seriously on less you want to kill the experience you do not have to drop on dime on this game if you don‚Äôt want to. 
All in all just an amazing game that runs super smooth on mobile.. Is there any anything I think could be added? Not really, I do play this on my PS5 more often but even on a phone or tablet just game is just stunning. Don‚Äôt even read the reviews, Just buy it, Run around and collect some items and relax in this amazing world :)",5
"First off, I‚Äôve always been a big fan of open world games like Breath of the Wild and Skyrim. I‚Äôve also really struggled finding a good mobile game that will keep me hooked and entertained for more than 10 minutes. This game is amazing. The graphics are really solid, the story is intriguing, and it‚Äôs FREE. There‚Äôs really no pay-to-win aspect of the game, it‚Äôs free. That‚Äôs what blows my mind the most. Amazing job, developers. You‚Äôve certainly won me over. The only complaint I have is that even though my little brother‚Äôs iPad runs the iOS requirements, you don‚Äôt support the iPad itself, so we can‚Äôt play together.",5
I get major breath of the wild vibes from this game. It‚Äôs awesome and it‚Äôs free. You can pay for a chance to get a rare and great character but you can totally play this game without that too. It is no necessary at all to pay in order to be good at this game or complete it. It‚Äôs kinda like fortnite how you pay for skins even though they don‚Äôt really affect the game play. The controls are good for the iPad or iPhone. Although I wish so badly they made the game controller comparable cause it would make it tens times better. But for now you can only play with the controls on the screen. I promise you‚Äôll get sucked into playing this for hours.,5
"Definitely beautiful. I've never seen a mobile RPG this beautiful, even on PC. This game will bring your phone down to its' knees, but not because it's unoptimized, but just because of its' detailed graphics and amazingly far draw distance. The graphics are, IMO, far better than any other mobile game out there, even PUBG and Infinity Blade 3 and what else I've played before. Just prepare a fan to cool your phone's CPU and GPU when playing this game. Also, if you're an anime fan, you should definitely try it out. You might be in for a surprise.

Wasn't a fan of Honkai Impact, but this game is entirely a different beast. 

Tech Otakus Save The World.",5
"I just started playing the game and I do love it. Though there is a few things that should change. 1. I would like to be able to customize my character, skin color, hair, face and body shape etc. 2. The game has some loading issues. Whenever I do open the game it takes a while for it to load. 3. When the game does load and I start playing it, my phone starts to over heat and sometimes the game starts to glitch. The screen is frozen but the sound continues to play. 
Anyway it‚Äôs still a beautiful game.",5
"Genshin Impact is an absolutely fantastic game. It's not the kind of game you should miss out on at all. However the only issue that irks me is the amount of storage needed. Sometimes it feels like you never have enough storage if you play this game on mobile, to the point where it feels like they don't consider storage limits for mobile players. As great as a game as this is, I find myself having to constantly delete apps that I may or may not need in the future. I only hope I don't need to upgrade my phone just to play this game. So please keep in mind the amount of storage you have available.",4
"Deserves MUCH higher ratings than the ones listed here. After reading reviews, i‚Äôm convinced the only people who rate 3 stars & below, either have a phone from 2013 or have a lack of understanding about top teir gameplay (because 3D sniper is their favorite game.) Look it‚Äôs not BOTW and it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs hell of a lot better than any half baked RPG i‚Äôve seen and played extensively on App Story, it‚Äôs F2P and extremely detailed (brilliant voice acting, marvelous soundtrack, an ACTUALLY interesting story) If you don‚Äôt believe me, just google ‚ÄúGenshin Impact Reviews‚Äù and see how groundbreaking they really are.",5
"The graphics are the best I have ever seen on mobile. I have been waiting for this game for a while now and I am not in anyway unsatisfied with it. If anything I am already excited for the next update. I will admit it does look a little like botw, but who cares it‚Äôs not a big deal. the Gacha system is worrying because I don‚Äôt want to have to pay. The only times I lag is when I am on FaceTime with my friends and that‚Äôs not a big deal. This has been my third day playing and I have probably done 30 or 40 wishes and I already got my favorite character! So yeah I don‚Äôt have any major complaints just little ones.",5
"There‚Äôs a lot of good things to say about this game, and a lot of bad. But I want to touch upon the fact that I‚Äôm going through a tough time right now, as I‚Äôm struggling with anxiety and don‚Äôt really feel like I fit in. But every day I find myself coming back to this game, farming for artifacts and doing my dailies and weeklies. It can be frustrating, what with the wishing system and all, but this game is helping me so, so much and I wanted to say thank you, Hoyoverse. You‚Äôve helped me through a dark period in my life and I can‚Äôt thank you enough for how much Genshin means to me.",5
"I‚Äôve downloaded this game in the past and played it for awhile b4 taking a break but after awhile I download it back and it said i needed more space so I deleted a bunch of photos and apps I had still didn‚Äôt work and went back to it the next day, it finally let me get a choice to log into an account but it wouldn‚Äôt even let me in and I tried to make a new one but it didn‚Äôt let me do that and it‚Äôs the same with Honkai impact also except that one can‚Äôt even get past the loading screen bc it says my network is bad so when I adjust my network it still doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm trying today again for both apps I just so hope u guys fix it",3
"It is absolutely ridiculous how much storage this game needs! I didn‚Äôt even get to play it and I ended up deleting everything on my phone because my friends were telling me how fun it was, I am so upset because I deleted so many photos that meant so much to me and I can‚Äôt get them back because I deleted for good just trying to get this game! I only recommend to get this game if your phone has a TON of storage or else you will be disappointed on how much information it asks you for and that you won‚Äôt even get to play it! üò° 
I would pay for more storage but some I can‚Äôt afford that right now and it just shouldn‚Äôt take this much storage, please try and change this game so that people can actually enjoy it üò°üò°üò°",1
"I fell in love with this game as soon as I got it, and I would highly recommend! But I can‚Äôt play it. I mean, I played the demo of it, and it was thrilling and fun, but after that I tried to download the full version, and I didn‚Äôt have enough storage. I thought I just needed to delete a few things and I could play it, but I soon realized the CRAZY RIDICULOUS amount of storage this uses! 

 The only way I could play this would be to delete all of my apps first, and there is NO WAY I‚Äôm doing that. I play FNaF and Good Pizza, Great Pizza and Sky: Children of the light! 

No WAY am I deleting those! I am so sorry if I offended you, but I am really upset. If you think of a way to let me play without using all that storage, please, PLEASE tell me! WildPanda out! üêº",2
This game is really fun at first and for a while it‚Äôs pretty good but it beats really repetitive and there are a lot of problems the creators won‚Äôt fix such as the inclusitivioty. The game try‚Äôs to represent black characters but really they are just tan characters there isn‚Äôt really a black character besides Xinyan but she was whitewashed in one of the events there other problems such as to really be good at the game you have to grind a bunch and when i say a bunch a mean a crap ton I‚Äôve played for over 2 years and I‚Äôm still constantly grinding but the game has some really fun aspects to it I just wish there would be a just a little effort to fix the problems throughout the game.,3
"I'm literally obsessed. I've spent so much money on primo gems and I can't stop. If addictive is what the creators were going for A+. The lore is so interesting, and I love the fighting mechanics. The bosses are not easy, but they aren't ridiculously overpowered either. I also love how it's an open world game. When you aren't following the storyline or fighting bosses, there so many other things to do, like exploring, fishing, fighting smaller mobs, as well as the many fun events they have which also make it so much easier to get primo gems. This game is everything I've ever wanted from an anime RPG.",5
"I am VERY disappointed in the representation of melanin, I don‚Äôt even know if you can call it melanin. I know you didn‚Äôt have the audacity to base a character off of Kandake and make her white, just say your racist and move on. There‚Äôs absolutely no way this is acceptable and your company should be held accountable and stop gaining money. Plus sumeru had me very disappointed also because I actually thought there would be at least one character with melanin. If you can add monsters, villains, plus sized, and designed characters, I see no problem with adding black characters to your little game. It won‚Äôt hurt you I promise unless your that scared of melanin, this is very disrespectful to me and other POC. If this continues your game with fail and become forgotten so I recommend not being racist. Thank you! üôÇ",1
I hardly ever leave reviews but I just had to say something about the reviews being left and defend this game. I have been playing Genshin impact since it released on the App Store. I honestly don‚Äôt know what people are talking about as far as things slowing down in the game after a year of playing. The company was going through a move however they still kept the game AMAZING while through their transition. This game surely is a a one of a kind RPG and it‚Äôs ranked up there with Zelda. If you are into or looking for a great rpg download and play this one. You won‚Äôt regret it!=),5
"I play the game so much and I love it! but the amount of money you have to pay just to get some gems is not amazing. Like if the prizes went down omg I would be in love but $30 for 14 wishes??? also I don‚Äôt like how if you get a five star character and then another banner comes out and you want that five star character, you can‚Äôt get them until the next banner their in. Like you have to wait until the NEXT time they come out. I love the game but the wishing system is something that could be worked on.",5
"When I first started playing this game surprised me by how good it is and how the main story quest was interesting. But as time went on and when Inazuma got released, the main story felt a bit bland. The characters in Inazuma felt like they had no special touch to it. Plus, when I had to do a story quest for Ayaka and Yoimiya I started to stop playing the original story quest because Ayaka‚Äôs was us going and helping her. Well yes we get to know more about her, but I wasn‚Äôt interested in her character. I just feel like the writing within characters just went downhill when Inazuma got released. And I still try to enjoy it, but most of the time when I‚Äôm playing Im just grinding for characters.",3
"So I started playing genshin impact two days ago and when paimon asks you to investigate the statue of the seven aka ameno (I think that‚Äôs the name) well I‚Äôm stuck in this place where there are two fire blob things keep on showing up and I attack them but when I try to leave the island by swimming,it just teleports me back to the island it‚Äôs the part where it says ‚Äúunexpected power‚Äù or something like that I‚Äôm currently re downloading genshin so yea I hope anyone can help me with this but so far the game is amazing I just wish I could continue the story since I‚Äôm stuck there",5
"Amazing! Love all the characters and quests! Butttttttttt, the logging out can get annoying and take away all the progress earned. Also, when fighting a boss, my character was shot out of sight in some long grass. All of my other players were down and the boss had revived. That can get awfully annoying. I wish the resources to level members up were more available. The boss fights are just really annoying and sometimes don‚Äôt get your Adventure Rank up that high. Great game regardless! 5/5, would recommend. Just please fix that bug that logs the game out maybe?",5
"When my dad downloaded Genshin for me, it was easily one of the best days of my life. I have never enjoyed a game so much. I love all the powers that there are to use. I love using characters, starting from Amber to Kaeya. I think all of them are powerful and unique in their own way, which makes this game even better. I think the games quality is so great, and the art is amazing! Honestly, the limits are endless when it comes to Genshin Impact. That is why I enjoy this to any anime fan, or someone who just wants to have fun. Genshin Impact is SPECTACULAR.",5
This game has been out for a year and I have given it a chance multiple times but this company is the most greedy and selfish company that I‚Äôve ever played a game for. Over the year countless players have been begging for changes just to make the game playable and enjoyable but Mihoyo sits behind the title of ‚Äúmobile gacha game‚Äù so they can take advantage of greedy systems like stamina or in game currency. They literally make it so you cannot play the game. You can burn through 24hrs worth of ‚Äústamina‚Äù in 10minutes and not get a single ‚Äúdrop‚Äù you were trying to grind for. They require more and more resources but essentially give you less resources per stamina. The Game had a lot of potential if only any other company in the world would have made this game. Thank you Mihoyo for personally ruining this game.,1
This is game is so much fun it‚Äôs very pretty and the community is very friendly. All the character designs are really fun. I‚Äôve been playing genshin impact for a couple mounths and one thing that I‚Äôm gonna say is that it‚Äôs really hard to pull five stars I know their meant to be really rare and I only have one. My friend who has been playing for 2 years has only 3 because we don‚Äôt want to pay because we‚Äôre broke. But that‚Äôs our problem all I could ask was if you could make it a little easier to get 5 stars or to get more primos easier. thank you!,5
"i adore this game! i picked it up recently durring baal‚Äôs banner and i honestly cannot believe it has taken me this long. i love mindless games like this, loads of farming and PVE? sign me up!

one thing to note for all the casual players out there is that you should really pick one five star you really want and save up until you have guaranteed. it *is* possible to get all the characters you want F2P, but only if you‚Äôre dedicated over a long stretch of time. reruns will happen eventually, so try to narrow your sights down as much as you can while you‚Äôre in the early game!",5
"Incase you‚Äôre new you probably are hesitant to download because of the low rating. So you see‚Ä¶ this had a high rating until the 1 year anniversary came about and the fans went insane for better rewards, well now they are giving us what we wanted and they are still not happy. They won‚Äôt take the bad reviews down. This is literally a 5 star app with a horrible community. Please download this life changing game. Ignore the community and their bad reviews and you‚Äôll get to see the wonders that is this game. I promise you won‚Äôt regret it.",5
"Alright so right off the bat, this is an AMAZING game, probably the best open world RPG I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôve never been a fan of open-world games to be honest, but after my friend kept on insisting me to play this, I thought why not? And I sure don‚Äôt regret that decision! However there‚Äôs a problem and a huge one at that..I‚Äôm an IOS player and the game seems to be crashing every 5-10 mins or sometimes 15 mins if I am lucky enough, the issue seems to be within the game as I‚Äôve tried every method there is to solve the issue but nope; that being said I don‚Äôt know if the devs are seeing this but please fix the issue.",4
"So I love this game. It‚Äôs by far one of the best iPhone games I‚Äôve ever played. The combat, character collection, character upgrades, story, and just about everything is great. But my one issue is that I‚Äôm currently a level 25 when I should actually be a level 26. For some reason the game won‚Äôt let me level up and I need to in order to complete the level 26 quest. And the weird thing is that I‚Äôm still getting XP points but I‚Äôve already gone past the total xp for level 25 and I currently have 3000 xp over but still a level 25. Please fix this issue as other people may also be experiencing it.",4
The game is good once you‚Äôre first getting it it‚Äôs like oh you don‚Äôt know what to do but then you like get more characters experience more and then you‚Äôre like OMG this game is so good I wish I got this before and then you‚Äôre like oh let‚Äôs watch some live people stream gentian and then you‚Äôre like wishing it and then gives you like a random five star characters and then you‚Äôre like OMG I‚Äôm going to get more food and stuff and then you get a fight stuff and then you get to level up it‚Äôs like other games but does like electric ice fire and other stuff and get to fight bad guys like those men,5
"I play genshin on my laptop and besides the fact that it burns my computer to a crisp, this is the best game ever. even at low graphics the game is still beautiful and is always updating with new content around every month. its super addicting and the community is amazing. I always feel so special when i get a new character or accomplish something in the game and it really helped me with finding my fandoms and what i enjoy. if you are a gacha lover, anime lover, or just a fantasy lover in general this is the best game! (even if you don‚Äôt like games like these atleast try it lol)",5
"It‚Äôs so much fun, it‚Äôs almost just like legend of zelda except with personal touches. I enjoy it and when I normally hit a big part in the story, or walk up to someone with an important quest, the game crashes! I‚Äôm on iPhone 8 and im unsure of why this is happening. I have tons of room in my storage, I‚Äôve already downloaded the whole game, but it still crashes. Also, I just want to mention that half the cooking recipes would never work in real life, me being partially skilled in cooking and baking.  And one last thing: if your reading this then I definitely recommend the game. It‚Äôs not inappropriate, and it‚Äôs just really fun. Check it out. Have a pleasant day~",4
"My god! This game is amazing and I‚Äôm addicted. Though it takes a little long to get higher in your adventure rank, the story makes up for that cause it‚Äôs so good. When I saved Stormterror (spoiler sorry) I cried cause the ‚Äúend‚Äù (there was more) was so good. The music is beautiful and I could listen to it all day. The characters are great. You have things you need to do to either get I higher adventure rank or finish the chapter of the story, it gives you something interesting to do. The character‚Äôs dialogue is great and so funny. I have no complaints! Thank you for making this game!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!",5
I play on pc now because I can‚Äôt on my phone tho I triedüò≠ because of storage problems this game takes about like 6gb so yea maybe even more because I had 6gb and I was able to play for a little until it made me download full version which is more anyways I play on pc now and it‚Äôs so much fun but I get tired of sitting on a chair I rather be able to play on phone on my bedü•∫ but yea the characters are super cuteü•∞ and the quest are so fun‚ù£Ô∏è also randomly kicks me off the game when I try to play on my phone and I have to start over the login processüò≠,5
"I'm having a really good time playing Genshin! I love the foraging aspect of the game, and how it feels so open world-like. I Think that there could be a few changes on the mobile version. Being able to change the placement of buttons would be great! As well as maybe making the joystick move to wherever you place your finger on the left hand side. I also think that the chance for getting 5 star characters should be raised slightly.

Other than these few suggestions, I'm having a great time!",5
"This game is really good, highly recommend. Try it out for yourself and play for a while, explore, and the game gets so much better the more you play! But also take advantage of the feeling you get while first starting off. It's a great feeling that you may never get again, though it's a great game! The fandom is also really great! Comfortable, fun, crazy but chill. I don't know how to explain it but I really like the random. Hope you enjoy genshin impact as much as I do; really recommend the game!",5
"This game is absolutely incredible. I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt find this game earlier. I started on PC and didn‚Äôt expect to have a good experience while on the go with mobile, but I was SO WRONG. The game is extremely fun to play in mobile. This is also the most fun I‚Äôve ever had as f2p in a gatcha game. I am literally addicted to the characters, story, art style and music of this game. Everything about it is so beautifully done. I love the ability to play between my iPad, iPhone, and PC. It‚Äôs such an amazing experience to play this game. If you are a fan of a Breathe of the Wild you NEED to give this game a try!",5
"This game is beyond remarkable, I can say without a doubt say Genshin Impact single handily is the best artistic creation of this century. Even so beyond this absolute masterpiece and the breathtaking scenery, the gameplay is certainly luring. This game has no bounds to its charm and charisma, in comparison to other games, this one truly outshines all. No game has ever exceeded my expectations as did this one. The artistry and appeal of this game are definitely something that‚Äôll last a lifetime. This is the game one could only previously dream of. Additionally, notably, this game listens to its community making it even more immersive and interactive!",5
"The game is hands down one of my most favorites out there, the story, the play style, the characters all so I m m a c u l a t e. Now as much as I love this game, there‚Äôs one highly important issue which puts the players security at risk. Hackers. It‚Äôs pretty common among Genshin players and I too recently was hacked and all of my savings for the venti rerun banner went down the drain. I just advise for now until they add 2 step authentication which THEY BETTER EVENTUALLY when making your account have your password just be random gibberish and connect it to an email made only for the game. Be careful out there players :3",5
Geshin impact developers i hope you respond but on to the point your game is amazing and i love it can you just lower the pity to like 70 or something and also can you fix the email response because tho you guys answer i emailed you guys about my acc being hacked and i forgot my password but when i went to register my email to the ‚ÄúForgot your password‚Äù it said account or email problem or something like that and I've got alot of five stars and i wouldn't want it to go to waste and thats all iv got to say.,5
"It‚Äôs not even a slight exaggeration to say that Genshin Impact has completely reset the bar on what a mobile RPG can be. An enormous, living open world, incredible graphics, cross-platform saves, fantastic story line - this game has it all.

Yes, it‚Äôs a gacha game, but don‚Äôt let that turn you off. The game gives you tons of free draws (and unlike most games, those free draws don‚Äôt die out as you progress through the game), and even the free characters are perfectly good - in fact, some of the free characters are among the best in the game (looking at you, Fischl).

Long story short, 10/10.",5
I can see this I have played so many games on the App Store I have paid for so many games I have bought into so many games and without even spending a penny yet this game is hands-down the greatest game created on mobile the only thing that could be done better is more questing lines make it easier to find the quests and more quest to help branch those ranks because right now after 25 it just becomes a big big grind other than that I love itI‚Äôve actually left work late because I‚Äôve been on this game not paying attention to time so that should tell you something!!,5
"This game is pretty similar to botw where u have to gather resources, go into temples, and fight monsters. It‚Äôs not entirely similar, there are many characters you can play as that contain different powers which was pretty cool.  The graphics are super good and I like how all the characters have voice actors. This game is very time consuming so if u like playing games that are long, I recommend this one. The only thing I think would be cool to add would be an option where you are able to change the outfits of all the characters you have. I haven‚Äôt gotten super far into the game yet so they might have that option but idküòÄ",5
"Finally, a game to save me from 2020‚Äôs demise. I have been playing 10+ hours a day when the game came out. I love everything about it! 

The open world exploration, the beautiful, fantasy-like graphics, the character design and the combat system are well-executed. The puzzles, chests and random events always sucked me into playing another 2 hours. Honestly, after reading the criticism for the gacha system, I believe the system is fair compared to other mobile games. There is a GUARANTEED legendary after 90 rolls‚Äî most gacha games don‚Äôt have a guarantee.

Also, you aren‚Äôt limited as F2P since this is an open world PvE game. People who spend money on the game will not affect you at all. Plus, the game gives you lots of opportunities to obtain characters! As long as you can control your own spending habits, you‚Äôll be fineee.

Genshin is apparently updating every 6 weeks with new content. I love the excitement of new stories, characters and puzzles. So far, after 200+ hours in, I‚Äôm not bored at all!",5
"I see that many people is complaining that the game doesn‚Äôt but if you read it said that it recommend playing on an iPhone 8 Plus, I am play on a iPhone X so I have no problems.   Anyway the game is sooo good I was waiting for this game for a year for it to get released. The graphics and everything is very good, no issues. I have been finding a game that free like you can explore and basically have freedom, not like those where you have to go back to the home screen then click mission and stuff. I also enjoy Honkai impact 3rd, but I like this a little better",5
I own an iPad about 3 years old and an iPhone 6S and hearing from friends I was really excited to try the game.  That was until I downloaded it on my iPad and the water animation just couldn‚Äôt load so it was just black as well as the actions scenes.  So in another effort to see if it was just the game or my devices I tried it on my phone and it wouldn‚Äôt even show the menu of the game and just showed a white screen until it sent me back to my home page.  It may just be with older devices but I wish there was settings options or something right at the beginning so you could lower the pixels or anything to possibly fix it even if the game isn't as cool as it would be with newer devices.,3
"When you start playing the game it‚Äôs very laggy, in all the cutscenes it‚Äôs so laggy the screen freezes and the audio glitches, and after you choose your twin there‚Äôs just this huge black wall and it‚Äôs covering a lot of the game. In some parts in this game the entire screen is only black which I find annoying and the part where you fend off storm terror, (which is early in the game) the screen is entirely black which makes this part of the game nearly impossible. Also when you step into water or fight something there‚Äôs just this huge blinding light which covers your character and most of your screen which I find very annoying. This game has potential but I just can‚Äôt see it.",3
"From the beautiful scenery to the fun gameplay, this game is a must-play for anyone who is looking for an open world rpg. The only thing I dislike about this game is the fact that just about everything is based off of ‚Äòchance‚Äô. From the character banners to even upgrading materials, it can feel as if nothing turns out the way you want it to. This of course is how they reel in the ‚Äòwhales‚Äô meaning that this game is not exactly free to play friendly. All in all, the gameplay is very fun but the fact that you can‚Äôt get a single valuable character/item without devoting time/money can be frustrating.",4
"Great game as long as you don‚Äôt engage with the community who are never satisfied with what the game offers. 
As an AR60 player who cleared everything including 36 starring abyss within the same day the new cycle hits, I would love to see more content in one patch in the future. I love the fact that the story are voiced so well and the quality of the lore never fails to disappoint. You could tell the devs, writers, voice actors, and the artists responsible put a lot of care and payed a lot of attention to details when it comes to developing the game.",5
"Istg this app is my lifeline i cant stop playing it! Ive been playing for a month and a half and  im in the sumeru archon quest. I cant wait for fontain to come out! Inazuma is the most beautiful nation, the events are just perfect, the wishing system is fun, artifacts and character levels are fun to do, quests are full of content and character designs are so good! There are fue glitches and they get patched all the time. The only thing i dont like is resin and how much you need it like if im trying to get a 4 piece artifact set, i might have to spend primogems and condensed resin but other than that i love this game!!",5
"Genshin impact is a really fun game. The only problem is, is how they expect us to be on such a high level. With a low amount of time. The mission Ritou Escape Plan is really hard. And I am still currently trying to do it. I am on the part where I have to defeat a series of people just to finish the mission. We have a minimum of five minuets and thirty seconds is used on waiting for the people to show up. On my Third try I defeated everyone, but the package was moving to slow. I am currently on my 16th try. Keep in mind all of my summoned characters are on level 50 and above. And their weapons are fully upgraded.",4
"This is an amazing game and I cannot overstate its impact.I‚Äôve been playing about 2 y already however, one footnote is that it‚Äôs definitely better to play with friends because it makes the experience so much better. You can all learn new skills and fun new things together and it makes the game less mundane at times. It‚Äôs also recommended that you watch some tutorials whether they are full on introductions or even just how to build a character. Overall, amazing game, definitely recommend.",5
"I love this game and have been obsessed with it since like all my friends have been playing it! The only problem is I got locked out of my account, I got back in, but when i did it had to download‚Ä¶ this took forever! IT TOOK AN HOUR TO GET TO 15%! that is not good! I left my device on for FOUR HOURS and when I got back it was STILL loading! I will never sign out of my account again ;-; IT TOOK 6 HOURS FOR THE GAME TO LOAD!!! Now that I‚Äôve loaded it when I signed in it only take a few seconds, but 6 HOURS MY GOD!!! Please fix this for the people who get locked out of their account! Thanks!!!",4
"The best parts of Genshin impact is it‚Äôs story! Don‚Äôt skip through it; your missing out on the majority of its charm if you skip!

Also the sound design and original music makes the game so immersive! The music is not just like some throwaway songs but they are literally bangers!

Another aspect of Genshin that makes it fun, is the events and playing with friends! It really brings the community together.

The focus majority of people have with this game tho, is the character/weapon building and farming (like for materials). Some people hate it and others love it. Me? I like it, it‚Äôs fun üò≠

But also with that, if you don‚Äôt earn primos through achievements, the only other option is to pay for it. I‚Äôll be frank, don‚Äôt buy primos just save the ones u earn and use it for a character or weapon you REALLY want.

My love for the story and music out weigh my hate for having to buy primogems for characters I want.
It‚Äôs 5 star but maybe 7/10.",5
"This game is really fun I played it basically all day I am only a decent ur level nine at the time I post this but I have the basic characters you get from amber to Lisa and I also got noella 
They all have really cool special ability‚Äôs and there‚Äôs so much characters and bosses, and enemies, it even has cooking!
The weird part is though is if you die you have to cook an egg to revive the character that dies it‚Äôs really fun if you like exploring doing quests fighting there‚Äôs also this little character that is really anoying but she floats and only appears when she likes something.",5
"Ngl this game isn‚Äôt meant for you to play every waking breath of the day. The game is still having add one and such so of course it takes time, if you are impatient and don‚Äôt like waiting for things then don‚Äôt even play itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It has really good graphics and storylines. Pretty cool characters too and I love I will get little side quest by just chatting to random people. There are so many beautiful stories in this game if you give it the time. Genuinely can‚Äôt wait to see what happens with this game, very anxious with scaramouche coming into the playing field but excited as well",5
"This is the best game I ever encounter before! I started to play in 2021 December, one day before New Years. And to be honest‚Ä¶ITS THE BEST GAME EVER!! I play everyday for hours and when it comes at night, I play until 3am. There‚Äôs so much to do at the game like commission, worlds quest, and story‚Äôs! And travel nation to nation finding your sister/brother! I would recommend this game if you are looking for a game with adventure, fighting, and story‚Äôs to uncover! if you wanna play with your friends, you better add them or you‚Äôll be lonely like me lol and you can play with people around the whole world! Btw‚Ä¶.PAIMOM IS SO CITE AND SO FUNNY!‚ú®üíï‚ú®ü´∂",5
"Led on anyone playing for endgame content.  Proceeded to alienate that playerbase and now completely shut them down.  There‚Äôs nothing to build your characters for.  I played since 1.5, led forward by events like Vagabond Sword and Labyrinth Warriors, things that made it seem like new challenging content was in the works.  And now I find nothing on the other side.

I have put money into this game in the name of making my characters powerful.  Quite frankly I want my money back.  It wasn‚Äôt worth it.

The further I got, in terms of the strength of my characters and teams, the more I saw the players I had learned from dropping off the game.  Now, I drop as well.  I feel used by a slimy company.  I suggest avoiding this gacha.  If you invest you will only end up in the same misery.",1
"DO NOT BUY, I know this sounds bad, but I have been playing for around 2 years now and the story is good, I know, but it is basically just a cash grab. If you want to get a character, you need to save up at least 10k primo gems, and that takes half a year. Even if you spend those 10k which you farmed for half a year, you still aren‚Äôt guaranteed to get it. The most frustrating thing of all, is that they don‚Äôt even care about their community. Their anniversary was a train wreck, everybody was thinking they were getting a free 5 star character, but instead we got 10 fates (a copy paste of a previous event) THATS ALL. Only when they reviews on here tanked, was when the released an apology. This game would be so much better in different hands, but until that changes, DO NOT BUT.",1
"I have been playing Genshin Impact for about a year and it is one of the most exciting and adventurous games that I‚Äôve ever played. The characters, the graphics, the lore, it‚Äôs all amazing. I would definitely recommend playing this game! Of course there are glitches but what game doesn‚Äôt? The developers always try their hardest to fix them by doing updates and when these updates happen if course they send their apologies and give you primo gems {money in a way} to make up for interrupting the game. In conclusion, very good game, would recommend playing.",5
"Okay, I‚Äôve been playing genshin since almost the beginning. At the first the game was great, it had good storylines, beautiful character designs, and was overall really enjoyable. Now‚Ä¶it‚Äôs horrible, it has a lack of originality, and one of the biggest things I hate is the whitewashing of the sumeru characters. Some of them are based on historical figures who either have tan or dark skin‚Ä¶now all of the released characters are WHITE except for one. The lack of diversity is sickening, as well as the overall designs. The big ears and mismatching clothes is horrible, they need to fire the design team. The only good things in recent time are the fatui harbingers, and most of them aren‚Äôt even going to be playable which is sad. Overall would not recommend playing this game, just go play breath of the wild and save your time.",1
"This game is amazing. The storyline is beautifully written and the characters are wonderfully designed. I found it through some friends and have been playing ever since. It really gets you into the game, and some of the cutscenes are just astonishing. I also love the gacha system. There are a few minor tweaks I would add to it, but other than that it is amazing! Although, I will say, the urge to spend money on it is fairly large. But, if you play enough there is no need! It keeps you playing daily, and I think anyone would love Genshin Impact!",5
"First of all, the quality of Genshin is so cool! It defeats other high quality games! (opinion) Plus the story line/plot is extremely amazing! It must have taken a super long time to make the whole thing! It is also really fun! I‚Äôve been addicted to this game forever! But there is on problem. It takes up a lot of storage on my phone. I understand why tho! I mean the quality, and the other things good quality games should have. Also the voice actors are just amazing! I‚Äôm running out of words that have the same meaning as amazing! Overall 10/10!",5
"It‚Äôs the best Anime game I have ever played but there is one problem: One time I was adventuring on a mountain when suddenly Paimon comes out and pulls me right off the mountain and onto the ground and kills that character. So then I try to find one of those statues that heals your characters so I turned around on the tiny island I landed on and story to find one; then Paimon comes out yet AGAIN and pulls me away from there. I tried again and again but she kept stopping me.
Now I‚Äôm stuck down there and cant heal my character.
So it would be really great if you could change that :D",5
So when I first got this game I thought it was a big scam but when it downloaded‚Ä¶..IT WAS SO FUN I love the story-line behind it the Beauty in the graphics! Everything about this game is good even the Voice of the people and how they act is amazing it‚Äôs like living that live that the person/people made! I am also a music fan so the music made me very happy because people that make games don‚Äôt do well with the music and one of the best parts‚Ä¶‚Ä¶NO ADS!!!!! I was so glad and you can be on this game for free! And I love that part. So if you want an anime game that‚Äôs fun and has a good story-line play this game!,5
"I love genshin! Believe me I do!! But it‚Äôs gacha system is. Odd.  The primogems, and i know i speak for everyone, are so hard to get as a free player. you get 60 primos a day w/ commissions which isn‚Äôt even enough for one single pull. And the fact that the guaranteed is so hard to reach is upsetting. Even if you aren‚Äôt f2p (free 2 play), if you buy the 100$ package for the first time you‚Äôll get the equivalent of 80 pulls which is just 10 away from guaranteed 5 star, however, after that it‚Äôs 100$ for ONLY 40 PULLS!!!! the least they can do is make it so 100 = 80 or maybe 100=60 because 40 is not right!     That‚Äôs it for me but, over all, genshin is a pretty solid game. Just pretty capitalist LOL",3
"I kinda get why they have it but it‚Äôs hard like so hard I think like how the guild gives us the loot when we finish it i feel like it‚Äôs makes it kinda worth it but at the same time not , it‚Äôs because when you get to the agent part it gets so hard like you get shot everywhere and your characters are dieing so fast like bruh can‚Äôt you kinda make it easier for the people who what it like there a button that would say do u want it hard for you or easy , but other than that I just wanna say genshin inpact is a VERY good game it has amazing graphics to it the npcs are amazing to everything looks like it took along time so keep up the great work tho !",3
"This game seems cooler then roblox and i really like the game. But there are two problems that i have with this. 
1. the game is super laggy on mobile 
2. everytime i play on my ipad or iphone it always kicks me out the app, sometimes it happens because the game lags really bad or earthier because the game can‚Äôt keep up with my wifi, but when i play on my pc it‚Äôs not lagging and it doesn‚Äôt throw me out of the app/game
I think they should fix that because it‚Äôs very annoying and i can‚Äôt play with my friends bc i always lag out
overall this game is really fun and amazing, definitely on a whole new level!!",4
"this game is literally so amazing it‚Äôs not even funny üò≠ the quality is so kewl mann also the bad thing about it is it takes up so much of ur storage unfortunately </3 and my phone literally is about to explode from overheating but that‚Äôs like the only bad things about it, also my friend had to delete all of his apps for genshin and it still says influence storage üòî just make sure u got enough storage before getting this, it‚Äôs taking up almost all of my storage haha and i have 64 gb so yea just make sure u got enough storage and a good device overall dis game is actually rly amazing",5
"Hey! I played this game since near the start but quit after a while due to rl work and issues and other stuff to do. I came back and been playing I believe 8 months and so. Now I am nearing endgame and stuff. This game is pretty boring, I can‚Äôt lie. It just a repetition of doing commission and wasting to your resin and maybe doing battle pass and hop off. But also due to the recent news of china‚Äôs ccp, genshin might get censored a lot which is bad for a game with lots of potential and ideas. But also mihoyo honestly just doesn‚Äôt care anymore‚Ä¶ the anniversary was trash and they won‚Äôt even listen to the community based. So honestly if you don‚Äôt wanna spent 1-2 hours of your life doing the same thing everyday, then this game is not for you.",2
"I‚Äôll try to keep it short. The game is a lot of fun and can keep you busy for hundreds of hours. The gacha odds are punishing and the rolls are pricey but generally the characters feel worth it. I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed the game. 

All that said, don‚Äôt expect the developers to care much for you or the community. They‚Äôve demonstrated time and time again that they really don‚Äôt value their player base. The anniversary event was a joke and there are still glaring flaws in the game (resin, end game content, etc) that they won‚Äôt even comment on. 

Download the game if you need a fun side distraction but I wouldn‚Äôt spend money on it to support these developers.",3
"I‚Äôve played since the game released last year, and I have loved it. The world building is beautiful, even on mobile, exploring the world of teyvat is an awe-inspiring experience. This world has been a refuge for me during the pandemic, and I‚Äôve made friends through a shared love of genshin. 

However, I am one of many players who feel a bit slighted by the lack of anniversary awards. With all the time, money, and energy that we‚Äôve put into this game, not getting anything as an anniversary reward feels really stingy. Mihoyo made BILLIONS on this game in a year, they can‚Äôt give us a single standard 5*? I‚Äôll update this review in the future if they step it up, but it is a good reminder that corporations don‚Äôt care about their customer base, even when the corporation created such a beautiful world for us to digitally enjoy.",1
I love the game and the graphics but the rewards are way too stingy. In their other games they gave 50 wishes + free 5 star. yes we got a free five star but it was only for the collab. For the anniversary they r giving us 10 standard pulls which isn‚Äôt so bad but then they are doing a art contest with only one  winner and you have like a 1% chance of winning and they are giving only 100 primos that not even one wish so if you did your daily commissions plus getting the reward you would get 1 wish. That is technically a 3 star weapon. Honestly I would give the game a 5 star if the rewards were better and also they don‚Äôt have to pay for the wishes either.,3
"I just wanted to say to the company this game is absolutely amazing and fun to play online with other or solo from all over the world. I love this and with the new updates including new characters coming soon, I can‚Äôt wait to see what else will be added to Genshin Impact in the near feature. I will definitely be playing this game and love how the map is so big where you have the choice to free roam or do stories missions. Keep up the wonderful work that your company put into making this game for us view and players, can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next. :)",5
"I mainly play genshin on my PC. The version on IOS is too unstable and crashes/close out from the game. 
Overall game quality is very nice. The story and lore is also entertaining and well worth your time to read through. This game has in-game events which usually comes along with some extra storyline. 
Overall the game fun and exciting. However, end game proves to be very boring grind and repeated cycle of daily. Their player to player interaction needs to be worked on. Unless you have or make new friends in Genshin this game could be short lived for you. As it seems, showing off your character(s)/artifacts/weapons/teapot seems to be the only cross-players interaction.",3
"Falsely advertises characters so that people spend money to get them, and then changes the language of their abilities so they are not able to do what people thought they would. Takes highly anticipated characters and locks their abilities away so that you are forced to spend money to make that character at all viable for use in the game. Usually a base 5 star character is usable, but recently you need to get 3 of that character at least to make them to the same power level..... and to get only one at full pity it costs around $200. they‚Äôve become very greedy and it‚Äôs hard to play anymore because you have to spend so much money to get good teams together. It‚Äôs impossible to be a free to play player and enjoy the characters and teams anymore.",1
"I think overall this is an amazing game. the art is on point, the character designs are great- but there is one thing i don‚Äôt like about it. so, i really want hu tao. i have been trying to get her ever since she came out. but, wishes are too hard to get. you have to pay 160 primogems for just one wish. the solution would be if you could exchange mora for primogems. you could exchange 1,000 mora for 300 primogems or something. i just think mora is kinda useless. that would give it a use, and make it easier to get wishes. again, amazing game, just that one little thing i don‚Äôt like. well, keep up the good work. bye now :)",4
I really do enjoy this game it‚Äôs very fun ain‚Äôt too baggy sometimes it kicks kicks me off the game I think that‚Äôs just because I don‚Äôt have a Lotta storage but after all that this game is 100% free in game purchases it‚Äôs perfect I love it I feel like you should make the characters a little easier to get including the five stars but I really do love this game I‚Äôve already got Euler Bennett Jan fee then T a Lotta good characters but the character I mostly want is Mona but this game is really good time so you should definitely play this game,5
"I tried playing a few times before and newer got very far. But now I just cant stop playing!! Idk what it is but Im hooked now. The graphics are beautiful, the controls are easy to understand but not so simple that it‚Äôs boring. The storyline is amazing and its so cute! I love that it‚Äôs in anime formü•∞ 
All in all so far this game is absolutely great. The only thing id change is allowing us to have a customizable character. I understand its apart of the story, its a story based game. So this isnt really a flaw its just something i dont personally 100% prefer. 5 stars though‚ú®‚≠êÔ∏è",5
"Well, this game is AMAZING it works so great for mobile and has great graphics! Plus, it‚Äôs super addicting, although there is one thing I want to address. I feel like you should have a little bit of a higher chance to get a 5 star, considering there‚Äôs a pity, from between 50-80 wishes. It‚Äôs so hard to get a 5 star, literally impossible, and play to win players work so hard, just to get a few 4 stars, and no 5 stars. Which I find kinda sad, but yeah, other than that, great game, and hopefully we have a few more re-runs for the 5 star banners :D",5
This game is so so so fun I cant stop playing it I play everyday for at least 3 hours. I‚Äôm still not at a high level  come to say that I just started about a week ago but I still enjoy it very much I play on my idea pad duet chrome book and the game won‚Äôt glitch as much as my phone .if it glitches a lot then switch devices it really works great just a few days ago I got Bennett out of the beginners banner I was so happy I‚Äôm also very happy with the new 1.5 update I hope that my sister will get zhongli  . Come to say that the intro is soo cool like I‚Äôm a female but I picked aether and it was cool üòí PAIMON IS SO CUTE!,5
"I‚Äôve been playing for about 6 weeks, my only regret is not downloading earlier. This game is 100% free to play, you get quite a good amount of Primogems (in game currency for acquiring new characters). Being that there is no PvP, anyone that whales out and drops tons of money is only shortcutting the game for themselves, there‚Äôs no true pay to win mechanic. The graphics are amazing, the controls are fluid and easy to learn, the game mechanics keep it fresh and fun, the puzzles range from incredibly easy (70%) to 10-15 minutes figuring out what needs to be done (5%).

I love Genshin impact and can‚Äôt wait to see what mihoyo does next!",5
"I love the game a lot. The only thing i kind of wish is that when playing as the male character, I completed the storm terror level and met venti at the tree after returning the lyre. I talked to him and he mentioned to the character of finding his brother and that threw me off and I wasn‚Äôt sure if i was hearing things but no he said brother instead of sister and I am playing the brother. I just wish when it came to playing as the opposite sex the characters in game would say the the proper terms  like sister when playing as the brother. But other than that this game is the best.",5
"I spent hundreds of hours and $150(I spent the time instead of $$ whenever possible). My account got hacked(Email/account name was changed without even an email to the associated email, which I thought was the bare minimum of account security). I‚Äôve been waiting over two weeks without even a response from the team in charge of fixing this kind of thing.  I got a basic response when I finally found the ticket option deep inside the game itself(I had to create another account to even get there).

They don‚Äôt respond to the email on their web site so don‚Äôt waste your time. 

Amazing game but the customer service is so bad I wouldn‚Äôt recommend spending any $$ unless you‚Äôre ok with randomly losing your account.  Unbelievably frustrating.",1
I love this game and I play it often but they really need to fix stuff about the primogems and wishes. I spend 4 days trying to get 1600 primogems for 10 wishes and I've gotten the same character 3 times now... and I barely get any reward for it. I don't care about the constellation because I never and will never use him. Either fix repeats in wishes or make 10 wishes cheaper... you have enough money to make this sacrifice for your fans. The character I want isn't even a 5 star either... I want Xinyan and she's a 4 star... also I got Jean from the Zhongli banner which is really unbelievable... you should make it so that the characters in the banner are the only characters you can get. I was really excited because I thought I got Zhongli but I got another character I will never use.,2
I got into my account I tried all the passwords in my head I could think of that I would make or already made oh yeah here goes the best part of the game it‚Äôs for PlayStation and on iOS but here goes one thing I want to request can you put on Nintendo switch and on Xbox I would honestly Love it on XboxBut still this is the best open world game I could ever find it is the best you can explore and there‚Äôs a kind that system that is really good and raids that‚Äôs my favorite thing about it and the fact that you can play online makes it even better and plenty other things that are good about this game.,5
"Probably wait a few months for them to fix the worst bugs. Beautiful game, has a ton of potential to be even comparable to Zelda BOTW, however because it is so wildly incomplete some things become very frustrating. Here are just a few:
1. Bosses will sometimes disappear. You can‚Äôt see them and you can‚Äôt do damage to them until they glitch back in. When they do glitch back in, it is sometimes with a refilled health bar. 
2. The story is incomplete, so in order to make it seem like it is enough content, progressing through is painfully slow and barred by your ‚Äúadventure rank‚Äù stat that you can only upgrade quickly through hours and hours of gameplay or money. 
3. Free to play is heavily punished. I understand they need to make a profit, but if that‚Äôs true then put some cost up front. Don‚Äôt ever count on getting a five star character. 
4. Aiming arrow shots is broken, completely useless. Don‚Äôt aim yourself, rely on the auto-aim. 
5. You‚Äôll sometimes get stuck in the terrain which is especially frustrating mid combat.
Other than these main ones, the rest is ok.
Wait for the bugs.",3
"So I‚Äôve played this for a few days. Good and fun game overall, characters are interesting and the mobs are fun to fight while also giving a good challenge. Why 4 stars? Trust me, I‚Äôd LOVE to give it 5 stars, and this is where the ‚Äúpatching‚Äù part from the title comes in. Myself and many other players suffer from a bug/glitch that hinders how far we can see, we can only see about 10-20 feet away from us and everything else is a dark abyss staring into your soul... and even worse, whenever you get wet, the water turns into ginormous black cubes that clings to your body which makes it really annoying. So good game, but Mihoyo needs to fix some stuff.",4
"I normally hate ftp games, but I‚Äôve played mihoyos previous game to this Honkai impact and really liked the graphics and art style so I decided to give this a shot and I can say I‚Äôm quite pleased. It‚Äôs like BOTW , and then it‚Äôs also it‚Äôs own things with its own unique mechanics and that‚Äôs good. It‚Äôs fun, and I‚Äôm becoming engrossed by the story and lore as well. And my god did they put some work in on developing deep deep deep lore for this game. And the most important thing, although I do purchase Iap‚Äôs, and I will for this one as well, but at no time do I feel pressured to do so, and there‚Äôs no predatory tactics in this game either. Very good game. Bravo mihoyo, you got a hit.",5
"I started playing this only a couple of days ago, and I‚Äôm addicted! The quests are fun, and the characters are sooo cute! I‚Äôm surprised at how great the game is, being it‚Äôs new and all. I can‚Äôt wait for further additions! I don‚Äôt dislike much about this game, but I have to say, I think the feeding characters for HP part is kind of flawed. Maybe add potions you can make so they can gain HP, but they don‚Äôt get full? Also, this isn‚Äôt needed or anything, but I think it would be cool to have an option where you can trade characters with other players. Besides that, this game is pretty much perfect, and I can‚Äôt wait for further updates!",5
So I saw the game and I looked really fun and it had a lot of good reviews so I decided that I would try it out but once I finish downloading I went into the game I was so excited to play it but when I open the game I have a white screen and I sat there for a bit and my phone went dark because it‚Äôs like it wasn‚Äôt loading so waited a little bit longer than the screen came on again so then I got out of the app and I deleted the app and I got it again but it didn‚Äôt work the next time that I got the app so then I decided to power off my phone and power it back on but I didn‚Äôt have any luck on that either so I don‚Äôt really know what to do and I can‚Äôt really play the game so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but the game did not work out for me so as much is that I‚Äôm giving it a bad review I am very sorry that the game did not work out.,1
Really good graphics and game play and art style but the problem is the graphics the game is smooth and all in medium setting and all in 30 frames but when you put high or 60 frames the game starts to lag I have an iPhone XR and the phone has to be in a cold environment so it can play in medium graphics so it does not overheat this doesn‚Äôt happen in other large games with good graphics such as cod but other than that the game is really good and has a good story awesome gameplay also the aiming of the archers feel very clunky but I think that has to do with the graphics mobile players really can‚Äôt aim with them,5
"Hello, first of all, I would like to say how much I love to play this. It‚Äôs a very fun app that keeps the player doing things. there‚Äôs so much availability in this to do. The only problem is that in the Chasm, when trying to complete the quest The Millennial Mountains, after defeating the treasure hoarders for the Cup of Common, there‚Äôs a bug where no cut scene is happening. This makes it harder for players to figure out how to retrieve the item and do the next step afterwards. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something that i have done but i have had other friends play on my device and nothing has happened either.",4
"I have not had this much fun with a game in years. The theme of the game and characters are quite chipper, and helps me forget about what year we are in. The voice acting is on point, and my lord, Paimon is too pure for this world. 

There are a few minor bugs. The worst I‚Äôve seen is where a character will stop moving their mouth even though you hear them talking. But that is certainly minor compared to the huge success the game is overall.

If you haven‚Äôt already hit that download button.....then get on it! If you are on the fence about this game, it will at least be worth the download and try.",5
"If you‚Äôre an Anime fan, and are looking for a new game to play that‚Äôs fun and interactive, well this is the game for you!!!! It‚Äôs got the best and TIER 10 story along with and immersive in game economy, as you level up and go on adventures there‚Äôs so much you can choose from, as well character customization in terms of choosing weapons and equipment to use. You can also team up with friends, run dungeons, and obtain powerful characters and weapons. No matter your play style each character is unique and allows your to optimize to your liking. Make a variety of combos for characters and weapons. This game is a must download!!!",5
I used to have a terrible review saying the creators are stupid for making this game but that was because of my storage so me thinking it was the game I left a bad review but my dad looked into it and turns out it was storage so now I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed with this game just have a few suggestions I‚Äôm thinking maybe your could be able to customize your character more just to make more like you but honestly even if you don‚Äôt add this feature please keep doing what your doing (it‚Äôs amazing)have a wonderful and blessed day!,5
"Genshin Impact is the best! There are so many cool characters! The lore is interesting and cool. There are many fun things to do like doing quests, exploring the world, leveling up your characters, and more! I like how you can play with friends and there are different regions. The music and graphics are also really nice. I love the scenery it‚Äôs so beautiful! The loading screen is also very cool. I love how it changes throughout the day. I also like how there is real weather like storms. The voice actors did amazing voicing their characters! I recommend the game for anyone who likes action, quests, and adventures.",5
"4 reasons why it‚Äôs bad so 5-4=1
I gave Genshin an 1 Star review because of

-There Very Low range of Skintones (no character is Black) and most Characters in the game are very Pale that it could make them be represented to a ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù. I think that if you create a Game with an Wide range of Characters, that you should make more variety‚Äôs of Skintones. There is only One (1) Character that is near mixed and or Black.

- Personally the game is not Fun. Most of the time you run around just to Fight another creature of some sort. Change up the game a little atleast? I would like to see instead of an Character update, a game Update something to the Game instead of giving the Fandom another ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù Looking Character.

- The Fandom. The fandom for this game is outrageous, they have s*xualize young characters and Many of the Comments in Videos, Photos like that are people that are in the Genshin fandom also and say ‚ÄúWowüòç‚Äù and it‚Äôs very‚Ä¶Disturbing, weird, Creepy and honestly just Weird.

- Characters. All the females in this game are Very Alike to the point where they don‚Äôt have an Unique personality that makes that character fun to play as an ‚ÄúMain‚Äù. The rep in this game is so bad. Make it better Genshin.",1
I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while because my friend encouraged me to but there‚Äôs a lot major problems with it starting with this game isn‚Äôt really friendly to mobile players storage to lag in the game then storyline and the characters were enjoyable and it was a very interesting storyline but over time it just became bland and frankly annoying especially paimon my biggest issue blatant racism how are you going to make characters  base of the Middle East and Africa and make them white as paper how are you going to take it character from desi and make her act a stereotype but then you make the enemies of the game really dark? Frankly this is more of a summary than anything else but the real point is I‚Äôm disappointed in this game and I hope you can approve one day,1
"I stared playing Genshin about a year ago. I was almost immediately addicted to it. The insane amount of detail and care that was put into making it was just too much for me, someone who was used to playing simple running games, to resist. Before I downloaded Genshin, my overall screen time for a dah would be less than an hour. After, it was more than 5 hours. I eventually had to force myself to delete it, because I could feel myself becoming more and more addicted, so much that playing Genshin was the only thing I wanted to do. If you are good at moderating by the amount of time you spend playing a game, by all means, go  ahead and play Genshin. Don‚Äôt let it consume your life like I almost did.",2
"Genshin was honestly a really fun game for me since I started which was around the beginning of 2021. Up until late December, the game became repetitive; the story lines were boring and too long, quests became too difficult unless you spent hours grinding, primos became more and more rarer to the point where you need to spend money to enjoy the game itself. Not to mention the fact that the new characters disappoint. They all have copies of an animation I‚Äôve seen in at least 2-3 other characters. I think co-op is also disappointing. For example, whenever I join a world just to talk to someone while I wait for something, they would be very rude. Now I don‚Äôt really care if its only 1 out of every like 10 people, but it happened to me so much. Not only that the genshin community is sometimes toxic.",1
"First let me say this, Genshin Impact is an amazing adventure game. When I first downloaded it, I was amazed and now I can't seem to stop playing. Overall gameplay wise, I would say it's a pretty good game. However, I do feel that Genshin Impact could use more characters of color. Almost every character and npc in the game are white. Some of the characters even glow because of their skin color, and not in the good way! This game would be so much better if Mihoyo were to include more poc people. And although my main problem right now is people of color, people of other races would also be much appreciated!",4
"The game is really good, unique characters, amazing story mode, i love everything in the game expect the pity, 90 pulls for a 5 star and it might be even be the one you want, i think there should at least be an event where the pity is at least 50 or 60 pity for beginners, and players who can‚Äôt always farm primos, also the higher the ar is the harder it is to get primos, considering that most quest don‚Äôt give you primos, so i think a single wish should be at least 100, so that the player who‚Äôs pulling could at least have something to work off after they‚Äôve spent a high amount of primo‚Äôs",4
"I have a huge problem particularly with the representation of skin tones in Genshin Impact.  Genshin Impact is a game that pulls a lot of inspiration from real world cultures and regions.  And yet, in a game with 48 characters currently and more upcoming, 46 of them are white skinned.  2 are mid toned.  There is zero black representation entirely. It is unacceptable. In leaks from the upcoming Egypt-inspired region, there will /maybe/ be two more mid toned characters coming.  All the others we know about are white skinned.  In a game as global as this that takes so much inspiration and makes so much profit from real people and cultures, it is not okay at all to have 99% of the characters white skinned.  I hope the devs will address this ASAP and change the designs of upcoming characters to give us many more mid and dark toned characters.",1
"I LOVE this game, i play it everyday and I am a part of the fandom as well. But the main issue is out of EVERY character in the game including npcs, theres only 2 darkskinned characters and theyre both 4 stars, kaeya and xinyan. the next reigon, sumeru, is based off the SWANA reigon yet only 1 leaked character is shown to have darker skin yet shes lighter than xinyan and kaeya. The sumeru characters are also extremely orientalist and have stereotypical and inaccurate designs, as if their main inspo was the ALADDIN movie..

And even if you dont care about the diversity, hoyoverse still refuses to listen to their community and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do once you‚Äôve basically beaten the game. WE NEED MORE END GAME CONTENT!!!! I‚Äôll change this to a 5* rating once they finally fix the diversity and actually does something about the stereotypes.",1
"Currently, there are only 2 dark skinned characters in the entire game. Kaeya and Xinyan. There are only 2 out of 50 playable characters in the game. This is honestly extremely sad and disheartening, especially when the people of Sumeru are all extremely pale except for Cyno and Dehya. This is extremely sickening, especially since Sumeru is based off of Egypt, where a lot of darker skinned people are. It‚Äôs also sickening that the dendro archon looks like a whiter version of Paimon. There is also extreme inaccuracy with cultural clothes, etc. Hoyoverse, please listen to what your fans want. Everyone is upset with Tighnari being white, as well as every other white character in Sumeru. We all want representation for darker skinned people. Listen to what your consumers want before you start losing money.",1
"This game is amazing, I started playing last year and I‚Äôm already at AR 50 . I‚Äôm a proud Bennett main and I‚Äôm waiting for Kazuha. It‚Äôs amazing how this game has incredible graphics and it gets even better every banner! Now we are getting double banner which is better because you don‚Äôt have to wait too long for re-runs. You can get satisfied by wishing and it‚Äôs not necessary to waist money, you can be f2p and have a bunch of primos to do your wishing .I love this game and really recommend it if you are looking for a open world fighting game or just a fun experience.",5
"I never thought i could fall in love with something so much in my life. This game has everything I‚Äôve ever searched for, from open world exploration to fun puzzle games, amazing character design and exciting combat. I‚Äôm completely captivated by the visuals, lore and story. The Genshin community is just as creative and fun to follow. 
However there are some obvious issues with the overall game, from a lack of end-game content, AR level rewards and a pretty damaging gatcha system. Mihoyo has made such a fun creative game and formed an amazing community, I just wish some of the user‚Äôs wishes would be respected in the future updates of the game.",4
"Look no further! This game has been very entertaining. I‚Äôm using it on an iPhone 13 max pro and it has been a dream. Controls are easy, graphics are amazing and I‚Äôve played for three days and have yet to be prompted to buy anything. The story is engaging, the characters are cute in an anime adult way. There is suggestive content so I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend for your 12 and under crowd just yet but it‚Äôs very well done and even playing on a phone I still feel like I get the full experience. Definitely worth your time üòã",5
"I don‚Äôt think there is a perfect combo of words to describe how much I love this game, it‚Äôs literally everything I hoped for and more. From the characters, to the places, to the story, it‚Äôs all super creative and really thought out and surreal. It‚Äôs really fun and I don‚Äôt think I could ever get bored of playing. However, once you start playing, time FLIES and I mean that literally, I‚Äôll spend an hour or more playing but it‚Äôs so real and crazy and just- Genshin- that it makes it hard to take a break !! ‚ôæ/10 would recommend and have been recommending to everyone <3 :D",5
"Same issues again‚Ä¶ i had created an account long time ago and everything was going great. I kept the app installed but didn‚Äôt open it for maybe 2 weeks? And when i did all of my progress was deleted. I uninstalled the app from frustration, i put up with so much lag for the sake of this game all for it to be deleted. A many of months later i reinstalled it to give it a second chance. The lag was still there but had gotten much better. After playing for months i had to uninstall due to all the space it takes. I reinstalled it today and again all of the progress is lost. And yes i used the same log in account both times. Its pointless to play a game with so many issues and it wont even bother saving your progress.",1
"Let me just say, Genshin Impact is a great game. With many characters to choose from, an amazing storyline, and it‚Äôs vast world and exploration, it‚Äôs hard to not like this game! However, there is a flaw that need to be acknowledged. 
In Genshin, there is a factor that allows you to ‚Äúwish‚Äù for weapons and characters depending on which banner you decide to wish on. However, a frustrating part of this factor is that there is a chance that you get the same character you have already. Just a recommendation, maybe lower the chances of getting a character you already own for more opportunities for new ones? This way you still have a chance to get the same character, it‚Äôs just not as likely. 
I don‚Äôt mean to hate on Genshin, it really is a beautiful game with amazing graphics. I was just bringing attention to a certain issue so it could possibly get fixed
Thank you for reading my review!

-Sophie ü§ç",5
"BUT, The inconsistency of the update, are quite usual, I don‚Äôt mind, because y‚Äôknow? Free primo gems, but other then that, I think we should have plus size characters and more darker skinned characters as well, I think it would bring more people to play mihoyos game, specially since there only 2 brown skin characters in the game itself. Also the lack of ways to get primo gems, I know you need to make money, but there are kids on this game, who don‚Äôt have access to cards or money at all, and they have a better chance at getting primos like others.",5
"I know a lot of people have been leaving bad reviews recently because they felt entitled to a better anniversary gift from Mihoyo, so I just wanted to leave this here.

Genshin Impact is a wonderful game. It has beautiful graphics, an interesting plot, lots of new content and events so you never get bored, and I personally thought the anniversary events and rewards were lovely!
Thank you to the Mihoyo team for all the hard work you put into the game and for making the game free so that everyone can enjoy it! 
I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone!",5
"I love this game and have been playing since Nov 2020 but I lost couple of accounts due to the lag of security. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the game is beautiful and free, I love all the characters, story‚Äôs, voice overs and stuff, what I don‚Äôt like is the resin system why do I have to wait 6 minutes for 1 resin? That‚Äôs the thing I got get I should t wait 6 minutes for 1 resin refreshed. I get it if I have to wait 3 minutes but I feel like 6 minutes is too much. Overall the game is fun to play I mean It‚Äôs genshin in stuff. I also suggest a age reveal for the characters because the fandom is fighting and fighting because of it. The game is great though!",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since roughy March, and it was fun at first. But the more I play the more boring and chore-like it becomes.
In late game, the only ways to earn Primogems or Wishes are from things like Commissions, AR level ups, and exploring. And that is extremely discouraging.
One wish/pull is 160 primogems, daily commissions give you 60. You have to do three days worth of commissions to afford a SINGLE pull. And most of the time, you won‚Äôt even get anything good.
Not to mention their disappointing anniversary gifts. One event banner 10 pull and what? Some primos? Not to mention the contests where you submit your hard work for a SLIM chance at 100 primos. Like really? Less than a pull? I‚Äôd be better off doing commissions.
In short, the game is not at all rewarding, the company behind it is extremely stingy, and the player base does NOT deserve getting treated like interns when they‚Äôre the ONLY reason people actually want to play this game.
I can guarantee that the ads showcasing characters getting annihilated by Hilichurls aren‚Äôt enticing anyone.
Mihoyo, do better.",3
"When starting the game is great overall. Wonderful characters music and a lot of stuff to do and explore. Design is also amazing. But unfortunately this is a gacha and the amount of summoning currency given out feels like its drip fed. Late game content is also barren and left wanting. Also 1 year anniversary rewards are basically non existent, which is disappointing to see since the community provides so much for this developer and they dont give much or anything for special events such as Christmas or easter or even their own anniversary. Other gacha games like Dragalia lost give out so many rewards for their anniversary like 380 free pulls, and they even have a much higher 5* drop rate. Mihoyo just feels like theyre sucking all of the good will out of their community with these latest anniversary ‚Äúrewards‚Äù.",1
"An amazing game from start to right before 2.0, great characters, phenomenal music, the lore is unique and great. What went wrong? Poor writing, horribly designed limited event characters, and overall greed since 2.0‚Äôs release of Inazuma has led me to dread playing this game. The anniversary rewards are next to nothing for the continued support that made miHoYo into a billion dollar company. This as well as an overall lack of endgame content has led myself and many others to leave reviews like these on Genshin Impact. As someone who has played since launch it pains me to do this, but miHoYo won‚Äôt listen any other way. Overall their quality for new content related to writing has had a sudden nosedive and makes the environment, music score, and aestheic of the new area go to waste.",1
"The story is beautiful, the traveler searching for his sister that got separated from him, every single character has flaws and goods in them. I just wish that we could rechose which traveler we pick. I don‚Äôt regret picking lumine, but I do wish I had done more research and picked aether. I was scared my parent would look at my screen and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a girl, why play as a boy?‚Äù But I have many other characters now, so it‚Äôs fine for me to have a few male characters since the game depends on luck, that is all I have to say, thank you for your time!",5
"I really love this game!.. but.. the prices and the pity.. The pity system is a little too high and extremely frustrating and the chances of getting a five star is also troubling. It‚Äôs also really hard to save up and get primogems because most of the primogems I earn aren‚Äôt enough to even do a 10 wish and I don‚Äôt really have the money to buy some either. But At same time I get why most of the stuff is high priced or high ranged. Still this is mainly the reason why people are quitting.. on the other hand everything is great! But I‚Äôd really appreciate it if we could at least get more primogems on tasks , ect.",4
"I have played this game since about November, I love this game and I generally play on pc. But recently I use a mobile iOS device, it crashes SO MUCH I crashed in about 20 seconds when I tried a bit ago. I love the gameplay, and the Gacha is very addicting. It is a beautiful game that has SO much potential but it should be more, how to put this. Device capable? My ipad is generally good but it has so many issues running the game. All the settings are at the lowest yet still crashes. And the storage is actually quite a lot. Other than the technical difficulties . LOVEIT",5
Okay so all together games is amazing I love it and all the amazing adventures and beautiful character designs but I see this on the internet a lot for the fandom and may you should make it to where you can choose a love partner for lumine or auther (not sure how to spell his name) and maybe there should be these small little quests with the character you chose for lumine or her brothers love partner for example for me it would be childe and lumine my fav ship but I just thought ya know it would make some of the random people happier bc they could make there ships come true ^^ just a idea ofc,5
"This game is so fun! I love playing Zelda Breath of the Wild on my switch and this is kinda like the mobile version of that! Lots of similarities. The graphics are beautiful and the animations are spot on. My only complaint would be that every few minutes it reconnects to the server and if it happens right after a cutscene, you have to watch it over again. Sometimes this happens continuously and I end up watching the same scene 5 times. It‚Äôs not that big of a deal but it does slow down gameplay quite a bit. Other than that, this game is awesome and I totally recommend! Thanks for making such an amazing game!",4
"This fame definitely deserves 4 stars and higher. Great graphics, audio, quality, story, characters. The only problem is that it takes way to long to level up the Adventure Rank and when that takes too long it makes me not want to play anymore because I can‚Äôt continue on with the story if I don‚Äôt meet the adventure rank requirement and if you can‚Äôt do that then please try bringing down the adventure rank requirement because it still takes way to long to get to that requirement.  Or add more ways to level up faster.",5
"I own an iphone 8 so I‚Äôm limited to a short few minutes (<40 minutes sometime <30 min) before app closes by itself and the overheating issue even on the lowest graphical setting possible is annoying.

Battery drains significantly on my end.

Mats are grind-y and takes a while to gather for both weapons and chars leveling.

Resin locked loot is a bit of a hassle but deters from people playing ALL day to get a certain loot...unless they are a whale who‚Äôll throw down for resins.

Primogems for random weapons and charas you probably do(n‚Äôt) want. Can be used for reset/gain max resin.

Enemies become tougher when world level increase. Watch your adventure rank (AR) and lvl up wisely.

Bounties and the other newly added quest seems forceful to complete imo.

No controller support for iphone.

Everything else is fantastic.

tl/dr:
 iphone 8 force close and overheats still.
Battery drains fast. 
Resin is okay but restricted.
 Primos, primos, primos.
World lvl = enemy toughness.
Bounties and newer quest seems forceful imo.
No controller support as of yet.

Edit: finally there‚Äôs controller support but game still overheats and force close on Iphone 8",3
Hey mihoyo! So the new venti banner came out and I worked for and saved up 18 wishes for venti ik it‚Äôs not a lot but I still tried really hard and since I‚Äôm at ar 32 and never rolled any five star item whatsoever I thought I‚Äôd be ok! And i only got two noelles and a rust so I‚Äôm kinda bawling my eyes out here my whole team if bennet lumine beidou and xingqiu MIHOYO HELP ME OUT PLEASE I don‚Äôt have any archer on my team and I really wanted venti idk what else to do- currently crying my eyes out and your luck that‚Äôs worse then bennet broke Genshin player! The chances of getting five stars are lower then I‚Äôd honestly like it and I‚Äôve spent so much trying to get venti and I still didn‚Äôt even get anything or anyone new  i don‚Äôt even use noelle MIHOYO PLEASE SEND SOME LUCK MY WAY IM CRYING SO HARD I JUST WANT VENTI,3
"hey Mihoyo, you‚Äôve made an amazing game and i am obsessed but, there‚Äôs a problem. so whenever i join my game and play for maybe, 20-25 mins the game just kicks me out. idk if it‚Äôs my phone or a game bug but it‚Äôs really getting annoying. i could be in the middle of a boss fight and open the world map so the game could stay open and i could take a break but when i exit it to continue, the game just kicks me out. i‚Äôve probably had the game for 2 to 3 months and ever since i‚Äôve had it this bug has always been present. and if it is a bug, please fix it as soon as possible.",5
"So I first started playing Genshin about a week or so after it came out. I would play once in a while but I never really had the time to fully get into it. Around three or so weeks ago, Albedo‚Äôs banner came out. I then spend so much time grinding for primogems and leveling up with my friends. It was super fun but it‚Äôs quite hard to get any good characters from the gacha without pity pulling, or spending money. There‚Äôs around a 0.56% chance to pull a 5 star without pity. Other than that, the game is really fun and overall built very well. I am excited to see what else this game offers in the future!!

"Many ppl are saying that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of breath of the wild when in reality it‚Äôs just like any other open world rpg. If anything, this game is a lot deeper than breath of the wild. They are both separate games and amazing regardless. It‚Äôs fairly easy to get wishes/primo gems when playing because there‚Äôs so many things to do. The only thing I would say is I would like to be able to do higher level domains with a lower world level. Let players access just a bit more!! And if they‚Äôre not strong enough then they can try later. Wish that we could do missions with friends too :(",5
"I have no words to express the sheer awesomeness of this game. The graphics is top notch. The cutscene are MOVIE quality. And the story and world building is so intricate and substantial and creative. I can‚Äôt believe this game is free. I‚Äôm so thankful bc this entire project is a creative genius‚Äôs product. I‚Äôm glad the world can enjoy it. It‚Äôs way more than the haters think it to be. ITS NOTHING like breath of the wild at all. It‚Äôs even better I think bc of the rpg gameplay and storyline. 

My only qualm is very small. I‚Äôm playing on my iPad and the controls are a bit iffy. It‚Äôs not the worst thing, but I would love to have the game on my Nintendo Switch. WILL GLADLY PAY FOR IT TOO.",5
"J have problems within the game. There‚Äôs a time lag whenever I open the chests even though my connection is great. many bugs like the one on the bridge. I always fall down on the river when i try to cross the bridge from montdhat. and worst of all the game has no in-game sounds (im talking about the Voice of the characters and other things). the game was completely silent (btw, i have my sounds at max. everything even my phone‚Äôs volume but i still couldn‚Äôt here anything). Developers, I really wish you clguys could fix this I wanna have better experience of the game, I really doü•≤ü•≤. I wish i can hear and experience the same things as the other players. I‚Äôm also just a mew player, I just started playing yesterday and I already have bad experience. I really hope that tou guys can fix this. Thank you very much.",1
"Game is far better then dragon raja in character personality and voices.

Combat is nice takes time getting used to like any mobile game. 

I wanted to play a game that got the itch that breath wild could quench, this game it‚Äôs not breath of wild but it‚Äôs good enough to feel the wild breezes. 

Most games this style, raja or gacha games there doing stuff all time to the point that it‚Äôs hard to stay on track and then the tasks become boring lists. However, this game rewards down time by giving tons of hidden things. 

If I were critical on anything bad about game it be hard to find anything to dislike. The one thing I‚Äôd say is I can clearly hear a light 16/14 year old voice for a 24 something dark/ptsd character and that bugs me slightly but that could just be me as someone who has experience being on the dark reality side. Who knows maybe the original acter is good. and the issue is from being dubbed.

 I really enjoyed the game besides minor bugs/voices. You should try it too.",5
"I wish there was a way to counter enemy attacks. Or a cause a break in them. Nothing literally infuriates me more than just getting pile driven by a million attacks all at once and there is literally nothing you can do.

Further more, on mobile changing out your characters or using your specials just sometimes doesnt work well. You can hammer away at the screen trying to swap or use a special and it just doesnt work. Ive yet to try it on pc to see if it makes more sense to play.

I also wish I could skip 90% of the dialogue and cut scenes. I dont really care about the story at all and I hate that you cant skip through it faster.

I think Im AR38 and Im happy to say I hardly know or care whats going on story wise, but the gameplay is fun and addicting. The gameplay gets super grindy after AR30 and theres not a whole lot to do after dailies. You can get single wishes just about daily but for the most part you have to pay money to try and get characters. I did roll diluc for free in wishes I earned in game, so that felt good. It does seem like they are considerably constant at rolling out new stuff, so thank you for creating a new free game for us to play.",2
"The game is terrible on my iPhone the cut scenes are all laggy and the only thing you can see the whole thing is the first picture that shows up. Voice acting and the effort put into this game is amazing but it doesn‚Äôt work on my phone. When I walk around the world there‚Äôs this big bubble like dome over me and I can‚Äôt see past it, it‚Äôs not very open world feeling when you can only see a few feet in front of your character. Also I got to the first village in the game and had to fight stormterror- but I couldn‚Äôt even see him! The black bubble completely blocked out the dragon and I was shooting off into an endless abyss. The game looks really really fun and I want to be able to play it normally but I can‚Äôt. :(",3
"I play a wide range of games similar in nature to this one, the first time I picked it up I didn‚Äôt think it would amount to much based on the style of tutorial laid out, the game has its moments of seriousness, comedy, strategic hardcore battles and puzzles.  I believe this is the best game in its own right, and worth playing for sure.  My only suggestion would be that it lacks some customization (home/character customization/pet/etc) but the map and everything is already huge with tons of missions so it‚Äôs just a minor suggestion.  Happy gaming!",5
"This game has very remarkable arts, and I like a lot of things about it. But. Sometimes the game would kick me out if I played for a while. Also, for me, there‚Äôs a problem with the Archon Quest: Of the Land Amidst Monoliths, Chapter I, Act I: Wangshu. The problem is, I can find the destination and see the golden sparkle on the ground meaning I‚Äôve arrived, but I can‚Äôt interact with it, no matter what. I can‚Äôt use co-op mode until I finish the quest, so please fix it if possible. I don‚Äôt know if other players have this problem, but anyway, overall this game is amazing.",5
"Okay, I started playing genshin a solid 6 moths ago. 

Undoubtedly, it‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôm absolutely in love with both the game, and the fandom. The gameplay is pretty entertaining but the story is also interesting and has incredible voice acting. The fandom is great as well. It has some toxic sides, as any fandom does, but the people in it are also hilarious, and have some super helpful tips. I personally don‚Äôt mind the gacha aspect if the game, and think it‚Äôs pretty fun. Definitely a five star recommendation to anybody who needs some saving from their boredom.",5
The graphics of the game is stunning. The character designs are very well made and beautiful. Playing in co-op is extremely fun and everyone I‚Äôve played with is super nice. The story is amazing and very well made. The other day I filled out a survey and in one of the sections they asked what my goals for the game was. I said to collect all the recipes because the food is beautiful and I love reading the descriptions. They ended up sending me three new recipes. This really made my day and shows that the moderators really care for the playerbase. Thank you mihoyo!,5
I‚Äôm a starter and so far it‚Äôs sooooo fun but I‚Äôve noticed that one the wish are expensive cant mihoyo just make a ten wish like 1000 primos and the gems has just got more and more boring you need to add more stuff to the game but regardless Genshin impact is a great game but it‚Äôs to money hungry. mihoyo just make getting primos easier and make the game cheaper in in app purchases other than that Genshin is good but there should also be more elemental skills and the luck for 10 wishes should be increased like i have saved for a long time and still didn‚Äôt get a the banner charecter,5
"This game has many flaws, from the community to the overall experience.

First, limited time events. I know the concept is so people play during a certain time but come on. Most limited time events give more information about a character than in their actual story quest. Like for example, Albedo. Other than his story quest, we never see him and if you wanted to learn more about him, you‚Äôd have to have been playing during 1.2 or 2.3. There are also characters who only appear and are relevant in limited events (Xinyan and Fischl). 

Secondly, the thing raiding most reviews nowadays, lack of diversity. I think it‚Äôs pretty much self-explanatory, if you look at the characters.

Which leads to my final thing, the voice actors being verbally abused because of the characters they voice. This one is not exactly about the game itself but about the community (how do you even get this bad of a community in the first place?) the VAs have been sent threats because of characters play-styles and designs.",3
"Although there might be people who dislike this game because of the rewards, I think it‚Äôs better they keep it like that. I mean, they have been putting effort into this game and trying to make it fun for players. I kinda wish that there isn‚Äôt a lot of toxic people and disgusting artists because it makes me uncomfortable whenever I see them in game, messages, and/or fanarts. I really hope this game has some form of fun so that new players will be able to experience them.    -An old player",5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for almost a year and I‚Äôve had an issue where I can‚Äôt login to Mihoyo Lab or redeem codes when a new update comes out. I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year and I was never super serious, so it didn‚Äôt really matter to me, but I‚Äôve started to be more serious recently. I‚Äôve been having a tough time linking accounts so I can redeem some extra primogems, so I‚Äôve had to work extra hard to earn them. If Game Center doesn‚Äôt get added to Mihoyo Lab and where you can redeem codes then I‚Äôm leaving because I‚Äôve spent money and too much time into this game to just restart. Add Game Center! (No I can‚Äôt use my apple it always says it‚Äôs third party and I have no account I‚Äôve made with apple. And I can‚Äôt think my Twitter either because once again it‚Äôs third party)",1
"I really hate giving bad reviews because I can think overall people put their hard work into this and don‚Äôt deserve it, but at this point I look at the reviews as a feedback on how to make the game more awesome! So here‚Äôs why I have it a 2. I downloaded genshin because it seemed interesting, i download it and I open the game up. First, I make an account. Second, I login..and here‚Äôs where the 2 starts come in. It just tells me that my network failed and to try again. This can‚Äôt be because of my wifi because all my other apps work perfectly. I really want to play Genshin and hope very much that you can fix this! If you do, i‚Äôll be happy to change my feedback to a 5 star.",2
"I absolutely love the game, amazing graphics, breathtaking 'domains' and unique yet gorgeous character designs. Each with an equally unique character design. My only problem is the amount of space it takes up is crazy! As of now, due to the update I will most likely have to miss Itto and whoever is coming after and I am sad. I cannot update the game unless my storage clears up, which I am sad about. Overall great though, would be nice if it was compatible on Mac-book but I‚Äôm not complaining as I‚Äôve heard it will be open for switch sometime in the future.",5
"This game is super fun, the characters are cool, however this game has serval problems with it. 
1. Mihoyo does not give enough premium currency for player to proper pull. This has been a problem for a while now.  Putting player in a bind to spend actual money to get the character they want. 
2. Characters who came out in early version are outdated and super weak compared to the newer characters. Amber and qiqi are on top of that list
3. The anniversary event is horrible. They did a web event where you get primos that aren‚Äôt even enough for a single pull and art competition where 10% of player could actually win something and it was $5 worth of primos or a new phone.",3
"In general, this game largely starts out extremely compelling due to amazing exploration, and is visually one of the greatest games to ever grace mobile, but its gameplay loop becomes extraordinarily repetitive and grindy - which does not make a compelling or fun experience. 

To try to compensate, the developers went full Skinner‚Äôs Box on the situation, which admittedly is how a lot of gacha games work, but if you‚Äôre expecting anything more than a prettier gacha game, look somewhere else.

The combat is‚Ä¶acceptable, but deliberately limited to encourage the player base to pull more and more on the gacha, which makes the game feel very cheap and classless - its a bit like going on a 8 hour plane ride, and the flight attendants then come around asking for $5 for a set of peanuts.

The story definitely starts out fantastic, but it becomes apparent that the developers have no idea where they‚Äôre going or how to pace it, and probably weren‚Äôt prepared for the unexpected success they had.

A shame, really, because its obvious the developers have talent, but they don‚Äôt have the discipline to make an actually good game.",2
Seriously? They spend millions of dollars on hash flags on Twitter for flair and personal promotion. But they couldn‚Äôt spend nothing and let everyone pick one‚Ä¶ just one free 5 star character or weapon? I don‚Äôt even mind the logging in every day and putting effort into playing to get goals but the rewards is just one 10 pull that if you‚Äôre not in pity you‚Äôre going to get something you don‚Äôt need or want. If it was working to get a free 5 star it would be worth it. Right now? Nah. And the community raffles is just a joke for more promotion. The game doesn‚Äôt need more promotion. It‚Äôs got plenty already. Do better next time. I won‚Äôt be throwing any more money into this game unless there‚Äôs an apology or something is done about this joke of a one year.,1
"probably one of the best games i‚Äôve played yet. though it‚Äôs kinda annoying when you keep pulling the same characters. like on the last banner, i was trying to pull for Fishel, a 4*, but i kept on getting Sucrose and Barbara which left me brokeü•≤I get this is a big game but man, it takes up so much storage üò©Graphics, ost, character designs, and voice actors for all languages are mind blowing. you can tell Mihoyo put a lot of work in it. its sad how some players are greedy, disrespectful and always asking for 5* and primos üòîbut besides that, this game will probably keep me playing for years or until they finish development. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíï",4
"This game is absolutely phenomenal.  The graphics, storyline, characters, gameplay, and so much more!  The updates are consistent and come regularly or quicker than expected.  All the characters to unlock each have something about them that make them a good character to use.  Mixing and matching teams for superb outplay. 
There is some minor things I would like to suggest about.

 Multiplayer is great too, though I wish you can have more people join over.  I understand though if you can‚Äôt.

The pity system is kind of not balanced, getting a 5 star is difficult.  Then there‚Äôs the 50/50 chance to even get your desired 5 star.  I do wish it was a little easier to get characters or more primogems, or even make the pulls cheaper.

Lagging occurs, but of course in every game it happens, so I‚Äôll be lenient about it, high graphics and all.

I do wish this game the best, and I‚Äôll gladly continue playing!",5
I love the game. But... I hate how it boils down to luck and gambling. So of course it's a gacha game and you have to put money to get characters. Other games allow you to get 5star characters with enough work. This doesn't. The drop rate on the 5star char is like 0.01. I wish they'd change it to cumulative chance. Other games do this where the more you spend the higher the chance of getting the character you want. Soon reaching a point where it's a guaranteed drop. I just feel left behind by 1) guys who are super lucky 2) guys with a ton of money. I really wish they'd fix this. If they do I see myself staying for longer and spending more cash on this nice game.,4
This game is awesome. I love It so much that it rivals some Zelda games still it can‚Äôt be as good:) love the anime art style! And it‚Äôs free minus the tempting in game purchases. The one thing I can nitpik that the download speeds for the full version are long but that does not matter when in the game it‚Äôs the lag. I use A iPod touch and I couldn‚Äôt get past the opening cutscene so I switched to pc. I have a surface pro 7 laptop so it‚Äôs no gaming computer but it gets the job done. And still not as big but little lag. In all this is a stunning anime inspired game and dispute anything I said this game is INCREDIBLY AWESOME üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè,5
"I wanted to try out genshin as a joke, and just for fun. But as I played, I got hooked! I think it‚Äôs very interesting how it works. The Adventure level, word level, opponents, and everything. I love how each character has their own element and fighting style. I‚Äôm a fan of catalysts. And i‚Äôve heard so much about updates in the future! Still waiting for albedos rerun! üòÜ Overall, I love the game. I play on mobile, so i can expected it to be buggy and crap, but it was quite the opposite! I highly recommend for people who took a second look at this game. Keep up the good work Mihoyo!",5
"I hated any talk of this game for the longest time because a friend of mine was annoying about it. I decided to humor him and get back into it one week and I was instantly hooked. The storyline is awesome, the characters are cool, the world and soundtrack are absolutely beautiful. Some game mechanics like team comps, artifacts, and elemental abilities take some time to get used to, but eventually they become second nature. If you‚Äôre considering playing the game, go for it. Either you don‚Äôt like it (which is totally fine) or you‚Äôll love it, just don‚Äôt become a degenerate ;)",5
"I love playing this game! The detail is astonishing, and it runs just fine on my phone and tablet. The gacha system is intriguing, and the new characters introduced in the banners are fantastic. My only problem recently with this game is that it won‚Äôt accept my payment method with a visa gift card. I looked online for a bit and I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm not the only one with this problem. I hope this can be fixed soon, or have an alternative where I can use the money on the gift card first. I was really hoping to buy genesis crystals to get a greater chance of getting Venti on his banner‚Äôs rerun.",5
"This game is nothing but downloading the data. I honestly have no problems whatsoever with a game downloading even though it could already be fully operational. This waiting screen is so cute I just thought I should mention it. I like doing concept art for friends who want a new background for iPhone or whatever... was wondering what drawing platform you use...
But pretty much to anyone looking to load the game, be patient. I‚Äôm usually not a patient person but the bridge and the girl on the hill looking out on a town/village/place is so relaxing I just don‚Äôt have anxiety waiting.
So thxs for calming the brain a bit",5
"‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

           this game is amazing for being in its early stages, because of the large game i recommend playing on a newer phone. i personally play on an iPhone 11 and it works fine with high graphics. many people give it one stars complaining about the graphics but they play on an older phone, or how the game has a stamina system. it‚Äôs a part of the game. this game resembles legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild in many aspects like, look, feel, and the system. 
overall great story, good graphics, and smooth gameplay. i am also excited for 1.3 bringing controller support. great job devs <3",5
"Ok so; some people are saying this is just breath of the wild, I see why they say that but it has features that aren't in LOZBOTW like; more characters then just link, powers, and other great stuff I'm too lazy to type because its quite early in the morning, anyway I felt like this game should have been 5$, my only complaint is that it takes 9GB of storage, the people behind this game really took their time and I can not thank them enough. ,oh and please add controller support, I feel like it would make the game a lot of more fun to play

                                                -Signing off, Agent J",5
Although I have some issues with the lag and crashes this game is still better than the majority of mobile rpg games out there. The fact that this game seems to have no limitations and has a great amount of potential is what makes this game so fun. The combination of Gacha and action rpg is what made this game unique and special. The fact that you can obtain these currency throughout the game instead of having to only be able to purchase makes this game less frustrating than other games. I‚Äôm looking forward to future updates!,5
"Honestly I love the art and the story and the characters and everything!!! It‚Äôs perfect !! But, the only thing makes me give it 2 stars is how it lags during gameplay. Like I can‚Äôt move at all after I login!! It‚Äôs frustrating, and sometimes the game won‚Äôt show at all, it‚Äôs just a black screen and all I hear is the audio. I had to leave the game and kiting again multiple times in an hour. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my fault, but when I leave the game my phone works just fine and I try other games and they work smoothly so I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore üòï I want to keep playing this game and I cant enjoy it unless the lag is fixed üò£ please help me, also thank u so much for making this game so cute and pretty!!! I enjoy the characters a lot! Especially my emergency food ‚ò∫Ô∏è",2
"I try to stay away from free to play with in app purchases because I have zero impulse control but this game does not disappoint. I did make a few purchases but the game can still be enjoyed without spending any money. It‚Äôs fun, the world is huge, the story is amazing, and the art work is phenomenal. 
I play FFXIV and Monster Hunter World and I‚Äôve put them on hold for weeks just to solely play Genshin Impact. 
I hope someone from support will see this!!
Please please please if you could would it be possible to add a way to check off geoculus and anemoculus?? üò≠üò≠
I‚Äôm 2 short of geo and 4 short of anemo üò©
If there be could like a tracker for each region with how many left to find over how many there are in the area just to narrow it down even a smidge would be fantastic ‚ô•Ô∏è
I think this addition would make it less daunting for newer players to undertake the search for them all and also provide incentive to explore new areas.
Thank you to the developers for an amazing game ‚ô•Ô∏è",5
"Ok straight up pros and cons about this game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong this game is extremely addicting once you get into it as most games should, but the fact that it‚Äôs a pc game that turned into a mobile app was a really big issue for me. This is due to Sony releasing Genshin Impact for PlayStation+. Now I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs there‚Äôs anything wrong with it, its just the fact that not everyone can enjoy an open world RPG as an app. So my suggestions are that if you‚Äôre planning on creating an app based on an Open World RPG platform which keep in mind, ‚Äúwas made on PC‚Äù. Can you at least make this game controller compatible so that way all players (Including veteran players) can enjoy this game to its fullest extent and see what more it has to offer? Please and thank you for reading this through. Sorry for the one star btw, I needed something eye catchingüòÇ",1
"So far this game is astounding! I adore all the minor details of it and the voiceovers so far! However, I quickly experienced a few issues such as not being able to see the surroundings. When I play, everything besides a small circle in which the character is in is blackened out, including the water. For some strange reason as well, when the character goes into the water, they started emitting a bright light. When this happens, I cannot turn it off and it makes it quite difficult to see the few surroundings that are actually shown. Other than that though, this game is fantastic!",4
"This game is very well made and just from an opinion of one of the players and more will most-likely share the same opinion, but I would love to play this game on controller using my phone, I don‚Äôt have a great computer to be able to play this or a PS4 but I would love to have controller support, it would definitely make the game more fun to play on iPhone, I‚Äôm not sure if this is already being planned or not but it would be great to have this feature, the game is still very easily playable on touchscreen it would just be more convenient for the people who have a controller but no supporting consoles for the game *besides IPhone that is*",4
Good game from what I have seen but the screen bugs out for the intro cutscene the screen stays black even when picking one of the main character gotta fix this right away the opening cutscene is a great experience so even though I love this game I‚Äôm not going to play it until it gets fixed also the audio bugs out for that cutscene as well and the open world game is a massive black screen I am on the iPad mini 4 it doesn‚Äôt crash but the entire game is black even the launch screen is black I really do hope this game works for this model,5
"Genshin impact is absolutely stunning with its plot line, music, and design for all of Teyvat and its characters. I think Genshin Impact is amazing and does deserve five stars for the review. If I could change anything about it, I would change the Crystal top-up format. Meaning, I would even out the prices for obtaining primogems through real currency. If that would change, then I would have no other concern with Genshin Impact and the experience I get from it. I would recommend this game for anyone who wants a fantastic experience in the gaming world.",5
"The only real flaw I see in this game is how the company dedicates each nation in the game to a place on earth, yet there is still a lack of diversity among playable characters. So many people have asked for darker skinned characters but instead we‚Äôre greeted with very pale skin. Whiter than paper. If a company can put so much effort into characters like Yunjin, do the same with the Sumeru characters. Also, some of the Sumeru character designs depict harmful stereotypes. It is not hard to give melanin to characters especially if enemies have much darker skin than playable characters. If this doesn‚Äôt change, there won‚Äôt be a lot of people playing this game. The ones that are won‚Äôt be good people and they‚Äôll just give this game a bad rep.",2
"I‚Äôll admit, this game is definitely one of my favorites of all time. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. The gacha system is magical, and pretty fair, (in my opinion) the characters are amazing and unique, and the graphics are better than my own eyesight. However, if you try to play the mobile version, it takes up an INSANE amount of storage, and takes me 2 weeks to download the full version, and gets laggy very quickly. I love this game, but would prefer if you were to help out the mobile players, if possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I‚Äôm hoping Mihoyo/hoyoverse will allow sumeru and the next nations have more diversity because of the countries Natlan and Sumeru represents. Aside from that, I constantly worry about the lack of space I have in my phone. Imagine how much space Genshin will take up once it‚Äôs completely finished. The game has great quality and amazing scenery in each of the three current nations that we have access to. The game is pretty good, hopefully the game will have more levels in the adventure rank to help keep the player attached to the game other things.",4
"I‚Äôve played genshin for over a year, in that year i‚Äôve seen many things wrong with the company itself, the games ok but it‚Äôs the company, you ask for players opinions and suggestions and then completely ignore them. For example, the surveys you asked us to take, i saw multiple people ask for more skin color diversity, but you completely ignored every single one. You also ignore all the fans PLEADS for my diversity, and other example is the new sumeru region. Literally ZERO poc, even a darker color. The new character Candace, that was announced on your twitter, she‚Äôs based on a dark skinned queen, the queens skin is a lot dark but candace is whiter then a lot of white people i know, just the pure disrespect to poc, im getting sick of it. That‚Äôs all i have to say i hope you take these things into serious consideration.",1
"After playing this game for over a year, I am incredibly disappointed in the lack of diversity as more characters and regions continue to be introduced. As of now, there are over 40 characters and yet only 2 are confirmed to have ‚Äútan‚Äù skin. Hoyoverse has continued to show that they value profit over representation and is using the cultures of predominantly brown cultures at the expense of depicting their people accurately. Currently, in-game NPCs from the country based off of the middle east and africa (also possibly SE asia) are entirely white in skin color and the company appears to be continuing this trend with the region‚Äôs characters. This is unacceptable from a company that explicitly stated that it valued diversity and representation. Seems they‚Äôre just too scared to do so properly when it involves non-white characters.",1

"I used to love the game but now, I despise it. Its very addictive, and if I didn't stop myself, there would probably be many problems regarding to in real life. (I'm pretty sure my friend got addicted and shes mad at me now because I deleted it.) Secondly, the quests are too hard. Like many people, the quests and daily commissions have made me angry and stressed, just over a small game, which is a problem because i'm being overdramatic. Third, i'd become worried over it. It's possible that worrying about getting my daily commissions and finishing quests are one of the few reasons why I have been doing poorly in school as of when i'm writing this. Thank you for reading and make sure to watch how obsessed you can become just over a small game.",1
"This is probably the only game rating I will ever do, but I just have to say, GENSHIN IS AMAZINGü•¥. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and the character designs are adorable and well thought out! I love the gameplay even considering I am a mobile player. The events are always fun and I enjoy pulling for new characters as It feels extremely rewarding to get who you wanted after working hard for the currency! If you‚Äôre considering getting this game, you should go for it!! The community is amazing and so is all the voice cast and devs! :)

Thanks for reading!!‚ù§Ô∏è",5
So I‚Äôve tried reaching out to support but I haven‚Äôt had any luck. So I was playing when the game first came out and was in love. The graphics and everything is perfect but I had some issues going on and stop playing and undownloaded the game. I tried to come back and play but my account doesn‚Äôt seem to be saved or can be recovered. I had gotten almost through the whole game and wanted to come back and beat but I can‚Äôt get my account back. Please can anyone help me? I need help recovering my account with all my memories and stuff.,5
"I love everything about this game, it‚Äôs super fun and I play it every single day. Really the only issue for me is the fact that I have to use my iPad to buy the battle pass. I can use the online crystal top-up to get genesis crystals or buy blessing of the welkin moon, but there‚Äôs no option to buy gnostic hymn or gnostic chorus. I have to delete everything off my iPad, re-download Genshin Impact just to buy the battle pass and then delete it right back off. It‚Äôs so inconvenient just to buy one thing, I don‚Äôt think it would be hard at all to just add an option to buy it on the top-up website.",4
I saw a lot of adds about it and I was like this is getting annoying but anyway I downloaded it was super fun! It‚Äôs a story game with interesting and very detailed characters! Like the personality the outfits the voices and the story It‚Äôs amazing! I have no idea How many times I‚Äôm going say how good it is because well it‚Äôs just a fun game! So I recommend downloading and you won‚Äôt regret it! But one thing that makes me mad tho is that my game always lags and crashes because of my very old iPad I hope I can get a new one soon so it won‚Äôt lag.,5
"This is a good game. I enjoy my time while playing (mostly on PC) and the characters and controls are quite fun. It has support for Bluetooth controllers like Xbox, which is really nice. That being said, it does have its issues. 

It feels like acquiring 5-star characters is unnecessarily difficult. The cost is just too much to reach pity. Being able to earn a character through another type of grind would be nice. And likely increase engagement with the game. 

End game content is kind of dry. Which again, lowers engagement. I want more to do when the story content is finished until the next story update. But it's just not there. 

Some functionality could be fixed. I shouldn't have to be logged in on my phone to make purchases in-game. My account is still the same. So why do I have to remain on the platform I purchased the game on just to buy something?

Again, the game is good. But I think addressing these problems would make it great.",4
"I had started a while, ago. Everything is fun, nothing bad about the content, and other small details of the game. The game isn‚Äôt too money-hungry, while people have time to obtain achievements and (+). My only concern is that since I can‚Äôt do this on my Mac laptop, so I used it on my phone but it takes up too much space, almost too much to call it controllable for average people, I‚Äôm not a expert on technology, but hopefully there is a way to fix that. I tried to find other people‚Äôs opinions on ways to go around this, but there isn‚Äôt. I wouldn‚Äôt advise looking for ways to fix this otherwise then managing your storage capacity. anyways thanks for reading of you happen to find this. I may consider this a 5 star if I didn‚Äôt have this issue. Have a good day <3",1
"Genshin impact is probably the best rpg game I have EVER downloaded. The quests are super fun to complete, along with getting to know all the characters. Everything in general is just immaculate! A suggestion would be to add more customization. Jean and Barbara are the only characters at the moment that have multiple clothes (that I know of) but, I think that when a certain friendship level is reached an outfit unlocks for the character. Other than that the game is super good. I honestly play a lot of hours per day which has never happened to me with other apps lolz.",5
"The game is amazing it‚Äôs just there is so many graphics that you have to wait hours to load even weeks to load I deleted the game because there was so much loading the loading restarted then I deleted the game, so I suggest to remove a lot of graphics that are not useful or nobody uses  interactions with it or never see‚Äôs it. Also when you take out the graphics and resources, pls make the loading faster / less slower it‚Äôs taking weeks to load and it restarted pls fix your game so the loading is faster and take out unnecessary resources and graphics so the game loads faster and it‚Äôs less laggy. I hope all of the developers of Genshin impact will take my advice.                 By: Miral",2
"it has amazing visuals and effects even when the settings are turned down really low! it has a great story line and characters and ive gotten emotionally attached to quite a few now- the monsters and bosses are really fun to fight, especially when figuring out elemental reactions. my phone struggles with running the game so sometimes it crashes, but its a really big game and the crashing doesn‚Äôt bother me that much. i can honestly stay up for hours just playing this game if i didn‚Äôt have anything to do. definitely get it if youre able to!",5
"This is one of the best games to come out in a very long time, the graphics, items, dungeons and music are amazing. The open world adventure with treasure around every corner and battles to be fought in every camp, cave or dungeon‚Äîlove it! 

The resin system moderates the progress of some players in the community who want to skip to god mode and burn worlds down. But the resin system, as annoying as it is sometimes, is the best answer in a game of chapters. 

This game just hit chapter two, players can now access Inazuma and learn more about Raiden Shogun, Sangonomiya Kokomi, Koju Sara and the vision decree. There are more than 10 chapters planned and it took a year to get through the first two chapters! 

Large file size game but best in genre, the developers have a knack for hitting the players with surprising content out of the blue. A lot of people were upset with them at the one year anniversary, but that‚Äôs our world, greedy and entitled for no reason‚Ä¶",5
"Other people at this time are leaving genshin for cookie run and leaving bad reviews, but those people are just greedy for rewards. They just want characters. I‚Äôve spent some money on the game already, so I‚Äôm not leaving this game any time soon. I think the anniversary rewards are actually decent. And I hope people know that you can do perfectly fine without any other characters. I challenged myself once to make a team with the four starter characters and use that for a week. It went really well. And I love exploring the world of genshin impact.",5
"Pros: 
1. Music - the score perfectly captures the chill, open world adventuring spirit 
2. Huge open world to explore 
3. Graphics are nice 

Cons: 
1. Combat - crowd control from elemental reactions usually goes against the player as you are constantly smashing your space bar to be unfrozen or free from yourself from a bubble, flying across the battlefield off the end of an enemy shield, and electricity stopping you from getting a single attack in. On top of crowd control, you need certain characters in order to get past enemy shields, and those characters can be hard to get unless you spend an arm and a leg. 
2. Your NPC companion ‚ÄúPaimon‚Äù is 100 times more annoying that Navi. She has an incredibly high pitch voice, tracks about herself in the 3rd person, and has the maturity level of a 5 year old. 
3. The rewards are a joke.
4. Characters are incredibly hard to get, as the reward system is crap and every new character is only available for a limited time. Once their banner is done you can‚Äôt get that character again.
  
TLDR: bad combat + Annoying companion + greedy devs = bad game",2
"The world is super huge and there‚Äôs so much content to find for free. Not to mention, they release new content every month or so with small events in between.

There‚Äôs no pvp elements, so it isn‚Äôt pay to win. You can pay money to progress faster or get characters easier, but you can get by with the starters, and the story quests give you premium currency to spend on characters.

I highly recommend. It takes patience to progress, but there‚Äôs also ways to spend time grinding to keep you busy between releases.",5
"Mihoyo has made an amazing game, but Is extremely greedy. After doing story quests, things can get a bit boring quite fast. Sure grinding in the game can be fun, but I also want more content to play and do. And things like commissions and events don‚Äôt give you as many primo gems as they should. 
The anniversary rewards are also EXTREMELY disappointing. Many players I club ding me have spent 100+ on this game, and we get 10 wishes?? That‚Äôs it?? For bearing through the boring content, and paying money towards YOUR game, YOU are being EXTREMELY HREEDY AND RUDE. Mihoyo no longer cared for their fan base, they only care fir money, even though they have ALL THE MONEY THEY NEED. Giving away something such as a free five standard star is NOT going to ruin your money and sales, if anything it‚Äôll bring more people TOWARDS YOUR GAME.",1
"first off, it's important for me to mention: i love genshin impact. i've been playing it since launch and have invested a lot of time & money into it. however, this is no longer a matter of liking the game or not. the devs behind it are extremely money-hungry and ungrateful to the players who have brought this game so much success. we as a fanbase are reaching the end of our ropes. we're sick of having our feedback ignored, sick of watching the devs grow more and more money-hungry with each update, and sick of back-to-back underpowered 5-stars who are extremely hard to obtain without spending money. those who pay for the game are no longer getting their money's worth, and free-to-play users are no longer getting their time and effort's worth. i've seen multiple genshin content creators quit the game within the past few weeks alone, and this trend will only continue if we continue to be sidelined and ignored. i need this company to do better, and i feel the only way they will listen is if we hit them in the wallet or app store rating. don't give this game your valuable time unless the devs step up and start caring about their community.",1
"I really like to play Genshin but there are a few problems. Let's say that u main Rosaria, right? When ur fighting and there is a cyro slime/pyro slime it always goes directly to the cyro one and wastes more time for spiral abyss.
 2, when ur viewing artifacts, sometimes the atk goes higher but when u view it again it goes to the same (idk if that's a glitch). 
Lastly, when you use Noelle, her shield works but not all the time. I was trying to fight a boss and my character still took big damage even though i had her shield. I don't know if that's suppose to happen, but Genshin is still a good game; sometimes it makes me rage.",4
"I have played this game for about two months, but within two weeks I defeated 18/22 Mondstat missions. I have rolled over 300 times most likely, and spent nearly 40$ on this game as it was a hyper fixation of mine. I worked so hard but I constantly get duplicates of weapons and just weapons in general. I just now rolled 10 times for the limited event and got a duplicate claymore sword for the third time. I have rolled two 5 star weapons and 9 of the other weapons (the purple tier ones). I am AR rank 32 and the reason why I have stoped playing as much is because of how hard I work and I always get nothing. I‚Äôm truly disappointed. Genuinely, furiously disappointed. I‚Äôve tried so hard and worked so much to get the characters I want, atleast non duplicate ones!! But I always lose.",1
I love this game so far it has a nice story line and this game has lots to do so you can‚Äôt get bored that easily üòÇbut there a glitch with the behind the scenes quest so I decided to do a different quest before that one big mistake because it glitched that quest and so now how ever many times I change the time to 6 and walk out and in of the tavern nothing happens and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it so now I‚Äôm stuck üò≠ so if your reading this and haven‚Äôt got to that quest or are about to please do that quest first so you don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did üôÇ,5
"I‚Äôve been played for about a month or so now, and it‚Äôs been pretty good. My only problem is that it‚Äôs hard to get primogems. 

The player base is probably made up of a decent amount of kids, and one of the main ways to get primogems is through paying money. I‚Äôm one of those people who can‚Äôt pay for themselves online, so it takes forever to get the amount of primogems I need for a 10 pull in which all I get is a bow and crappy stuff. So maybe develop something like gift cards? I‚Äôm a late player so most of the promo codes have expired by now. 

But hey, at least I have Barbara at C4 from all the duplicates.",4
"Hi. I‚Äôve been playing genshin for a few imonths now and it crashes so often, to the point where its unplayable. I can‚Äôt even wish or use my blade before it crahses. The most i can do is look at the wish banner, but I can‚Äôt wish. I put my setting down, uninstalled and installed again, but nothing worked. I  really would like to continue playing this game, but if the game engine can‚Äôt even work when I log in then I can‚Äôt play it anymore. It wasn‚Äôt bad at first, from just 1 crash every 3 weeks or so, to cradhing whenever something important happens, to EVERY 2 SECONDS. 2 SECONDS. Please help Mihoyo.",4
"I‚Äôm pretty new to Genshin Impact, but I can already say it‚Äôs AMAZING! It has great graphics, an awesome storyline, and even the side quests are pretty fun! I like being able to walk around and take in the beautiful scenes. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an action packed game!

 Edit: So I just read the 1 star reviews, and what the heck? More than half of them were just people begging for characters. If all your going to do is beg, do us all a favor and don‚Äôt review at all! You‚Äôre not going to always get the character you want.",5
"I I have to say is, before I played this game I was in a bit of a video game crisis. Very game I for boring or badly designed or both. I also wanted a game that I could geek out indefinitely and not run out of content. Genshin Impact has completely changed that! I have new characters to simp for, fancy cultural words to pronounce, infinite lore to dive deep into, and an entire brand new fandom. This game is receiving so much love and support. Also, I‚Äôd like to say that the memes are absolutely HILARIOUS! Some of them are intentional by Mihoyo. I will stick with Genshin Impact till it finishes in 10 years!!!",5
"I really like this game it‚Äôs really detailed it has a great story and great graphics, there is nothing wrong with it and I‚Äôve been playing for a while there‚Äôs no ads so it makes it enjoyable I love how you can unlock characters as you go but I wish they would let the main character use multiple items.
But that‚Äôs not a huge problem and its not that much of a need so it doesn‚Äôt bother me as much overall the game is fun and enjoyable and you won‚Äôt get bored of it and it‚Äôs for grown ups , kids and teenagers so have fun playing this gameüòä",5
"Tbh I don‚Äôt write reviews because I figure other people probably don‚Äôt care/the game is horrible. But I‚Äôm reality this game is so beautifully made. The details on this are what really shook me. The grass the way it rains and the water droplets on your character? Amazing. For anyone complaining about lag. It‚Äôs a big game, designed to be played on PC but it was made into a mobile game. Y‚Äôall need to invest in a better phone so that it can run smoothly if you buy a cheap phone...you‚Äôre going to get a cheap performance. Obviously. Anyways...Props to Mihoyo for such an all around amazing game. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Its a good game, i like basically the whole concept of it. The CO-OP MODE Seems to be dead due to the fact everyone declines, even i do that. Some way to fix the co-op would be cool, like maybe having open world chat so we can chat with others and plan before we actually part up, rather than them just requesting when im literally in a middle of a quest lol. It crashes every 2 hours of gameplay, but thats only if i go to the wish system or whenever i open up the party setup menu, it just crashes. Overall its a good game. Some improvement. To make the game more playable, either fix co-op or just get rid of it over all, add world chat and see if that works. Idk.",4
This game has easily proven to be one of my favorite rpg games! The characters are lovable and you don‚Äôt need to spend money to continue the game. The only complaint it‚Äôs for the mobile players that when you and your friend or whoever are trying to friend each-other it says ‚Äúplayer UID not found‚Äù. Even if you‚Äôd put the correct player UID and both be adventure rank 16 it‚Äôs won‚Äôt let you. I hope this problem could be fixed so me and my friend along with many more people can enjoy the multiplayer feature.,5
"Trails of Tianqiu. It‚Äôs such a hard quest. If you would please make it easier it would be nice. It‚Äôs ruined my experience for most of this game. I can‚Äôt play with friends and even if I do continue and play this quest has my ability to play with friends is taken. I can never beat the Abyss Mage and the other monsters on the third floor, in the South tower? I‚Äôve done everything. I‚Äôve destroyed the thing that raises their defence but despite me having my best characters and artifacts on I can‚Äôt beat them. If you could at least make them easier to beat maybe others won‚Äôt struggle as much as I have so far. But really it is almost impossible to beat :/",4
"I can not say enough that this game is amazing. The best I‚Äôve ever played, the graphics are beautiful and you really feel like your right there. The music is simply amazing, it sets the mood. When your in liyue vs monstdadt the music changes and that detail really pleases me. I can‚Äôt wait to see more things added to the game to make it even better! I think that it can only go up from here, everything is great and I think the only problem is the lag on mobile platforms, my sisters game lags a lot but mobile games tend to lag a lot in general, but anyways that‚Äôs about it everything else is üÖêüÖúüÖêüÖ©üÖòüÖùüÖñ",5
"The way you unlock characters is through random selection pay wall. There is no way to actually buy certain characters. This practice should be illegal. I will not pay a cent on this game with a mechanic line that, where I have paid for characters in other games in the past. Missing out on a sale, and I am not alone. This style of micro transaction is toxic and predatory.

What's convenient though is that I'm getting by just fine with only the free characters. I got a few wish characters and they sick terribly, which just solidifies my stance. Getting bad characters is such a waste of time and potentially money... If you're dumb. Oh and yes of course you can get duplicates, why wouldn't they remove that. A quick Google search will show you that people have lost thousands to this game. Done be that guy. It's not worth it.",1
"While there are certainly good aspects about the game, MiHoYo seems to have shown they care very little about player feedback.  The most minimal of changes have been made to the resin system, and primogems are still very hard to acquire as a f2p player.  Furthermore, the newest character released ZhongLi is vary aggressively mediocre to outright bad in the current meta and has 4 different mechanics gated behind obtaining duplicates of his character.  When a limited time character costing $360 requires 6 copies to be passable and the developers aren‚Äôt even willing to buff him despite many many parts of the fan base complaining, there is clearly something wrong with the game.  I am only leaving this review because I really hope this game will become more generous and respectful to the fan base.",1
"A beautiful game, I cannot believe something like this is even possible on mobile.  Amazing gameplay, graphics, story...  Gacha system is terrible however.  .6 percent chance for a 5 star? Unreal...for a game as beautiful as this I would have happily paid actual cash for it, so I‚Äôm rly unsure how such a monetisation scheme like this works except to pray on those with gambling problems.  It worries me that this is where we are at with gaming...free to pay needs to stop.   For something of this quality, I would happily fork over 40-50 bucks just to be able to play with everything unlocked, and not having to worry someone with a mental health issue is being exploited.",4
"Such an amazing game! The only thing that‚Äôs making me sad is the fact that I can‚Äôt play using my ipad 7.. i hope the game can be compatible with more devices in the future.
Also i wish i can add my friends who play in Asia while im using America‚Äôs server.
And i think that we should be able to customize our main character‚Äôs face, hair, and color .. how tall and wide too, also maybe have the ability to choose our main character‚Äôs weapon type also.
O and i wish if the game was more of an online game where i can see real people walking around lol... yeah that‚Äôs all other than that I HONESTLY LOVE THIS GAME LIKE OMG T^T",5
"Guys, they do specify to have a better phone then an Iphone 8 or equivalent, and even if you have a less powerful phone you can still play the game. It takes a while to get to the main menu, and if there is a white screen then quits the game, reopen and wait. The cut scenes will be laggy so keep that in mind.

Other than people conplaining about things they can‚Äôt have, it‚Äôs a wonderful game and everything you would want in a mobile game. However the file size is quite big, but not necessarily a problem.",5
"I seriously recommend this game for anyone who is new to MMo‚Äôs. The story telling and sheer DETAIL is something to be marveled at. I‚Äôve only had this game for a few days but I am ashamed to say I am addicted. But for anyone who didn‚Äôt read the paragraph above, here are a few reasons why I like the game:
1. The lore/world building
2. The characters
3. It‚Äôs completely free to download 
4. It‚Äôs family friendly
5. The animation QUALITY 
6.The detail put into the backgrounds
7. Cool and unique mechanics
8. Mechanics that are simple and easy to get the hang of
9. The sheer size of the world
10. So many options! (Cooking, recipe collecting, artifact hunting, dungeon grinding, playing through the story quest, meeting people, or just exploring. The real mvp is the guide, 10/10. 
P.S. This game takes a lot of storage so when you download it, just wait a few hours and try to log in. It takes about half a minute to log in every time. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",5
"This game is phenomenal overall. It‚Äôs very fun to play, however, I will say that there are quite a few slow aspects. Some of the missions drag and it‚Äôs horrendously slow to level up your adventure rank. Plus, if you aren‚Äôt lucky (like me), you won‚Äôt draw many characters from wishes (although my husband almost has all of them). 
The app is an absolute nightmare. I‚Äôm lucky to make it 3 minutes without it crashing and that‚Äôs a lot of luck. I‚Äôve had to play on PC (which is where it really shines) but I‚Äôve never had a game crash nearly as much as this on my iPad/iPhone. Also, the load time to start this game is ridiculous on the iPad/iPhone and everything I have is current on software. Hoping it improves to where it is actually playable on mobile!",2
"Ok its a good game, and they did a good job but the thing is, people are saying its not diverse enough. I agree a bit, because the characters arent tan enough. But the one thing that i think people are being a bit too serious about is the clothes that they wear. Sure, it seems a little exaggerated, and irl no one from that culture would have worn that, but you have got to understand that this isnt earth it is creatively interpreted and wont be exactly like how it is irl. I hope you understand and I hope they make tanner characters in the future ( im pretty sure they arent white washing on purpose, its an Asian game after all).",4
Just started playing this game today and I like the game two things I would recommend the developers do is come up with a easier way for your characters to unequip there weapons and etc because it‚Äôs kind of confusing how u go about it and also idk if it‚Äôs just me but I reached level 20 already and I‚Äôm looking around and I don‚Äôt see a lot of different kinds of monsters just slimes and so called trolls which is ok I guess but having more different things to attack would be better other then that love the way u guys put this game together it‚Äôs different in a way which is cool,5
"Look I know the game is absolutely amazing but I have one problem, in the moon bathed deep quest I did the final seal and all the water mimics showed up but then one of my characters died  and I was out of food so I left to heal at a statue but then when I returned all the mimics were gone and I wasn‚Äôt able to proceed to the next phase. I played around with the seals but no luck came. I searched around the internet for ways to fix this problem. But again no luck. I know I should‚Äôve prepared in advance but didn‚Äôt think I would need too. I also do need to get to enkonomiya to ascend my Shenhe so please fix this problem!",4
"I see a lot of people having 2 main complaints here.
1. Takes up too much storage
2. Breath of the Wild ripoff 
Firstly, LOOK AT THIS GAME. It‚Äôs so gorgeous and beautiful and over all well-made what do you expect??? I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs some way you can deleted packages though, like if you downloaded multiple voice-overs you can delete the ones that you don‚Äôt use, which saves a lot of storage. The graphics are clean, the music is just a collection of masterpieces, and the voice acting is amazing. Taking up a lot of storage is expected!
Secondly, do you know what a ripoff is?? Do you see traced images of Zelda characters in the game? Do they have the same plot-line and lore? Do they have a similar art style? Does Zelda have a gacha system? No. Even Genshin is obviously inspired by BOTW, it‚Äôs NOT a ripoff. I love both Genshin and Zelda and I hope people can stop pitting the games against each other.
Anyway, love Genshin. The end :D",5
Amazing game always wanted to play games like these but I‚Äôm on mobile but if you could consider adding character mounts like I suggested in the survey I would really appreciate it!! But a very lovely scenery just slight graphic differences with mobile and pc but it‚Äôs still fine and very fun to play sometimes there are beuatiful sceneries that I cant help not taking a ‚Äúdramatic screenshot‚Äù pls consider my request on mounts and aslo if you could add character customization it gets boring looking at one outfit I‚Äôd like to make my own unique one it‚Äôs still a 5 stars from me :),5
"If you‚Äôre not playing the game 15 hours a day and not shelling your life savings into this game, this is certainly the most enjoyment you‚Äôll ever have with a mobile game. The gameplay and HUD customization can be a little frustrating, but it is bare-able. Aside from that, the exploration, lore, environment, graphics, music, and voice acting work together to make the game very enjoyable. Mind you this is a mobile game, and you can experience it all without paying money (the money stuff is just for people who take this game too seriously.)",5
"This game captures you in the beginning with it‚Äôs beautiful graphics and wonderful story telling. That is till you get past adventure rank 20 then it‚Äôs boring. The gameplay is repetitive. World lvl 7 and up is absolutely impossible if your characters don‚Äôt have constellations. And you only get constellations by pulling the same character in a gatcha lol. That‚Äôs not even the worst part, sure you can play with friends and join their world. But you can‚Äôt complete quest, at world lvl 7 without the help of other people just going out and trying to unlock chest is impossible. Did I also mention friends who join can‚Äôt even open chest. Jesus Christ idk what they thought when they did that, if it‚Äôs going to be multiplayer then let it be multiplayer",1
"This got boring after like 10 minutes because we have to do non-plot related activities to move on to the main plot with no choice. Then the starter Pyro is so hard to use with the controls. Seems this game would work better on a console‚Ä¶ right? Thats because its copied off a console game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild. This game is a blatant discount with the stamina, the trials, and some of the plot. In Zelda, Link wakes up in hyrule 100 years later. In this game the character wakes up in a whole ‚Äònother world after being trapped. This is different, but the trials in this game are the EXACT same thing as the ruins that give you abilities in Zelda but you get characters or new moves instead of abilities. This game is not worth it at all. I really liked it at first, too.",1
"Honestly it doesnt even deserve one star üò≠ but its open world so i give it that. The POC representation is horrible, the game gets boring so fast, the rewards we get are horribly stingy for all the money people pay. They could atleast FOR FREE. give us more darker toned characters. But no‚Ä¶.they wanna make every single NPC playable character twilight bright. Except for 3 . This isnt the first time theyve done something horribly racist like this though. Theres a character from honkai named carole peppers,she is an ENTIRE black stereotype. And an upcoming character , dori is a racial stereotype as well i believe . We spend money on this game to have fun but we wont spend if you dont listen!! Sumeru characters shouldnt be that pale. Xinyan and kaeya are BARELY dark skinned. HOYOVERSE IS A RACIST COMPAY! STOP SPENDING MONEY ON THEM UNTIL WE GET WHAT WE WANT! THE RIGHT WAY , NO STEREOTYPES!!!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠",1
They don‚Äôt tell you you need to be in the same region as your friend when you start you have to put the region mine was not a America and I grinned to get co op to play with my friends who was on America servers they don‚Äôt tell you this until you figure it out your self got me mad cause when switching regions it don‚Äôt transfer data so I don‚Äôt have all my stuff from the other region I spend hours on so I can play with my friends I know for a long time fun game but only played to play with my friends now I have to start all over and say good bye to my data I‚Äôm not going to use on the other region I was playing on all lost I love the game but I don‚Äôt like do redo stuff,3
"This game is truly amazing words cant even describe how much enjoyment and content is packed into this game. This game although slow from the start, once you get past the tutorial everything seemingly opens up a world that is full and adventurous. You can go where you want, see incredible sights, fight strong monsters, collect a extremely large amount of characters, and completely avoid the main quest. EVERY npc has unique dialogue options. And also all every character has some kind of lore and life.",5
"Recommended for anyone who likes fantasy, anime, and/or open-world games. Hoyoverse has really made an amazing, beautiful game (so far), but they really do need to make permanent content that will keep players engaged even after finishing the events/quests that come out every 6 weeks. I have all the characters leveled up to 90, completed every quest, almost Adventure Rank 60, and got the map (released so far) to 100%. If they made certain event games or battle modes permanent, it would help keep players from getting bored.",5
"I‚Äôve been downloading and uninstalling RPG games for 4 days. I think I did over 20 games. A lot of pay to win. A lot of in your face ‚Äúbuy me‚Äù and a lot of games that try to look to realistic and it makes it hard to enjoy. This game has none of that. It‚Äôs flow is seemless, beautiful colors not to bright. Easy to use combat mechanics. Lovely story. It‚Äôs just releving to find something fun. 

I just wish they would add mounts or pets or something like that. They may have then. I‚Äôm only about a 1-2 hours into the game. A lot of traveling far is why I say this.",5
"I played this game for about two years, starting in the summer of 2020. I helped me a lot when dealing with mental illness and being home all the time. Unfortunately because of its predatory nature, it is basically a gambling game marketed towards children and people who aren‚Äôt that great at money management. The Gacha system is the worst contender here. It gives you just barely enough so that you keep gambling on it, you keep wishing until you get what you want, and before you know it, you‚Äôve spend all your money on pixels on a screen. I loved this game with all my heart, and it certainly made a huge impact (no pun intended) on my artwork and life in general. I‚Äôd highly advise only playing this game if you are 1. Responsible with money or 2. Fine with spending a lot of
Money.",1
"I love this game. It‚Äôs one of the only apps I use daily, even on top of some of the mainstream apps and games. The RPG style of Genshin and not just storyboards is awsome. I‚Äôm not a huge anime person, but this makes anime to something that‚Äôs not to all extremes. I love exploring and unlocking new characters, and I love how instead of sitting there and waiting for something to update, you can just go on a different app or turn your device off as it still downloads. Overall, I recommend to anybody wether they like anime or not, it‚Äôs so fun!",5
"This game is actually really entertaining. you get the feel of Zelda: Breath of the Wild while playing it (its actually like an exact copy). Ive been playing for a little over a year now, the only thing that i don‚Äôt enjoy about the game is how big the updates are. I still cant download the newest update and i‚Äôve deleted basically my entire phone at this point.

Other than big updates, the graphics are amazing, storyline is just so grasping and the CHARACTERS??  phenomenal. I got my 40 y/o dad addicted to it within 10 minutes of playing (he also hates anime). if it can hook my dad i'm positive it can hook anyone.",4
"This game is AWESOME! Logging on to do my dailies and some domains is so fun to do! I enjoy the adorable characters and playing with friends on this! One more thing about the game. Make the gems cheaper and wishes less gems, also make more stuff to do because sometimes AR gets so high with friends that the levels are boring for them. They said it‚Äôs like they repeat again but I have not gotten that high in AR yet. But! 5 stars totally and miHoYo is my fav developer because of this great game! Thank you miHoYo! I love this game with all my heart and I‚Äôm sure by the reviews everyone else does. GO GENSHIN!!üòÅüòÅüòÅ",5
"as someone who has been playing since xiaos first banner, im disappointed. the graphics, characters, and music is fine and wonderful, but the rewards you get are cheap and not even worth doing the quest/event. you could have spent hours on a quest because of the complex puzzles and bosses, and only get maybe 40 primogems. if youre like me who doesn't have the money to spend on primogems, you will never have enough time to get a decent amount of pulls to get even close to getting the character you wanted. since theres a 50/50 system, you couldve worked so long on every quest just to not get the character that could help your team. it makes your motivation to play the game drop since you honestly dont need only 40 primogems, if it was 70 or even 100 for the quests that you know will take hours to do, people might start playing more since they have a actually good prize that will benefit them. its just sad how you can have such an amazing game but make it almost impossible to get a decent amount of primogems to get the character you want.",2
"Love the game except rewards. For example anniversary rewards. When it comes to this gacha game and rewarding its players. You had to support them. Or submit are to win barely a ten pull. There new game on the looks of it there going to be more generous compared to Genshin. Us Genshin players would love to receive better rewards and better treatment for supporting/playing this game. I am also currently mad due to mihoyo making new inuzuma characters supports. We don‚Äôt want cheap rewards. We don‚Äôt want supports either we have many of those. I also wish there was an expansion on other elements.

"I love this game a lot, But the thing is‚Ä¶I cannot update it! I really love the details and everything! You‚Äôre kidding I just got Kokomi and now I can‚Äôt even play it anymore! :( I‚Äôm unsure If I lost my account or anything..But please, If this is a bug..FIX IT!!!! Or its the device I‚Äôm playing on. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm in the only one either. I‚Äôm thinking of deleting now! + I just spent 30$ I‚Äôm really sad. Because now I can‚Äôt get a refund or anything And I still want to play the game but I cannot because of this 2.2 Update even though I want to delete this I cannot my dream character is Hu Tao! I love her so muchh‚Ä¶But the update won‚Äôt work at alll!!!!!",4
"Two things need to be known 
for this review to make sense.
1. I also play Honkai Impact and have for a while now. The game runs relatively smoothly and has settings that drastically drop the quality of graphics allowing my phone to run it without crashes or significant lag.
2. I have an IPhone SE. The first gen. 

My issues with this game come from 1 thing. The lag. I have the game at the lowest custom settings yet it still crashes. I experience lag whenever I open a new menu, or move to a new area. I closed everything else, am on a good network, and even turn Bluetooth off. It still is absolutely abysmal. I think it would be nice if there was a way to stop my phone from trying to load all the grass and other stuff which doesn‚Äôt impact the plot or questing aspect of the game. Copying your other games ability to lower character quality would be nice as well. I would rather have the game run smoothly and look worse than look perfect but barley run.",4
"Hey, im here on behalf of a request, (Please at least read.) I suggest a system of trading 1-5 characters at a time with only those on your friends list, that way some people who have (Maybe C5 of a character they dont use or dont like) But the person they want to trade with loved that character and uses them constantly. It would benefit them. And in return they could trade for a character the other would also want. It would even out getting too many characters you dont want, and sharing-connecting with others",5
"preface: pros definitely outweigh cons, but i‚Äôm gonna be gearing more towards criticism in this review 

pros first: 
-it always manages to reveal and pleasantly surprise me with so much more content right when i think im almost done exploring the game, and ive been playing for a while 
-constant big updates 
-characters!
-visuals are amazing, especially at watatsumi island. i was blown away
-it‚Äôs a huge game with so much attention to the little things
-there are sweet heartfelt moments but also unexpectedly dark elements; i love it
-it‚Äôs a free to play that still gives players the whole game experience without needing to empty your wallet to get somewhere 
-much more?? 

cons:

- i think there‚Äôs a drastic increase in difficulty from world level 3 to world level 4. there are some quests that are literally impossible without spending weeks on the game just to get your characters strong enough to beat them 
-new update is not rewarding enough. although the chests have more primo gems, if you do pull anything with primogems from the gacha system theyre essentially useless if you have less to upgrade them with. i can get much better rewards in monstadt and liyue with 2x less difficulty 
-needs better clues on quests
-  this is small but i find really weird; boars just running into objects/obstructions and then fading out

-last but not least: anniversary rewards.. please compensate",5
"As a genshin player, i have played many other gacha games. so many different gacha games have amazing anniversary awards‚Ä¶ genshin giving us 10 rolls only and they didn‚Äôt even call it the genshin anniversary. the company that has made over a billion within half a year still refuses to give players a decent reward for enjoying and supporting the game. i have spent at least $200 on genshin and the lack of new content is creating a burnout for me and many other players. But the main issue is the anniversary and the lack of rewards for their loyal players. the lander rite festival event had better rewards than the anniversary itself somehow. mihoyo needs to up their game to keep their player base because a lot of players are gonna stop playing from the lack of anniversary rewards itself.",1
"I don‚Äôt get why people are so hype for this game? I played this game back when it first released and I had fun with it at first but then that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs started getting boring so I didn‚Äôt play it for weeks. This game was taking up lots of space so I just deleted it. Coming back now and seeing more and more 5 star reviews is just ???? Like, yall, this game nor the characters aren‚Äôt THAT amazing. Why are y‚Äôall so hype for a game with a greedy company?? Literally the rewards I got for this game were trash. Coming back for the 1st anniversary, the rewards are even more trash. this is a BILLION dollar company. How do you guys make this high quality game but make the rewards and gacha dogwater?? At least other members at this company work better on Honkai impact than whoever is working on this trashy game",1
Oh god no no no no no no please help I got a sword. Ok moyhoyo please make it so that you can only get the five star that‚Äôs on the event banner. Make it so that you can only get five star weapons from the weapon banner. And only charictars from the standard banner. I was pulling on the standard banner becuase I had a summon I could i could use AND THEN I GOT A WEAPON RUINING MY CHANCES OF GETTING A CHARICTAR. Also please help with the lag in inazuma I had to reload the game once becuase my screen went black but I could still hear what was going on. And I lag a lot. Other than that it‚Äôs a great game keep up the good work üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,5
"With the constantly expanding amount of space demanded by this game and mechanics that are really not mobile friendly i waited patiently until i could link my account to the ps4 so i could actually enjoy this game. I held on to it and suffered through the updates so i could keep my characters and everything i worked for but I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. My nephew linked my psn account so now i can go nowhere with this until god knows when, and there ANOTHER UPDATE. Whats more is theres an additional update for Honkai as well so im forced to make a decision. Im outraged the loss of hours of progress but im not giving up progress on Honkai. I shouldn‚Äôt have to choose like this. Words cannot express my anger, how could anyone have known not to attempt to link their account prior to now!?",1
"This is an absolutely fantastic free to play game that serves up a dynamic and fulfilling experience whether you have zero or hundreds of dollars to spend each month.

The sweet spot is about 15 dollars a month, by buying the blessing of the elkin moon (5 dollars for a daily dose of the in game premium currency), and 10 dollars every 6 weeks for the premium battle pass rewards.  You can spend more than this, but if you don‚Äôt care about collecting every character, there‚Äôs really no need to do so.

In the late game, be prepared to grind if you want to max everything out, but personally I find the gameplay loop to be so enjoyable that the grind feels more like a feature.

Currently, the game has an incredibly active schedule of events that keeps even maxed out endgame players like me busy and engaged, and hungry for more.

Whether you have the occasional 15 minutes or hours of daily playtime available, this is a must play.",5
"First off I simp for all the characters and that‚Äôs already worth 4 stars (except the kids bc u know). Second, it‚Äôs amazing that this game is free (except for in-game purchases but it‚Äôs not necessary so) and I love how it‚Äôs not completely impossible to get 5 stars without paying. I already have 2 five stars and I‚Äôve never spent real life money on this game. Overall, 10/10 very good game, very addictive, and I‚Äôm in love with Diluc and Mihoyo gave him to me so it‚Äôs a Bennett from me üëç
However, there is one problem which is email verification for signing in, which is basically nonexistent and has led to some hacking situations. Please fix this Mihoyo üõê",4
"to the people who are giving this game a low rating for no reason at all, like for example, ‚Äòits not giving me primogems, i spent too much money on this game, or give me a five star or else‚Äô just stop. all the people who have contributed to this game are trying their hardest and their best. instead of being a ton of petty losers because u cant get a certain 5 star or something, just stop playing genshin. we dont need people like you begging for a certain character and threatening MiHoYo, okay? also i think the game is amazing, so keep up the good work MiHoYo!",5
"This is so far the best graphics i have seen on any mobile game so far. The game is smooth, the characters are awesome and the map in this game is simply amazing. There are so much things you can do and you could be spending hours and hours on this game without even knowing it. However there is only one thing i wish this game to have. I just wish you could speak to other players through the microphone and not write everything you want to say. And that is one feature i would love so much to see in this amazing game.",5
"Tbh, Genshin Impact is one of the best games I‚Äôve experienced so far. They have the best graphics, extremely good BG music, A LOT of fun challenges, domains, and bosses, you can cook, you can even make your own home too! I also like that fact that each character, whether they‚Äôre a BG character or a playable one, they all have their own deep backstory. I also enjoy that we can hangout with some characters, especially Chongyun! He‚Äôs my favorite :D. And I also like we can learn more of the history of the gods by doing quest and such. I just-
This game is just too good to not play!",5
"i was doimg the ascension to level 26 quest and i uad gotten through about 5-6 levels of fighting and then when i got to the purple block thingy (i forgot the name but its that electric purple block that you have to fight in 9 minutes) i was fighting it for a while and i was SO close to beating it and i had 33 seconds left and my game FROZE and now i have to start the entire thing over again JUST to get to a small level like 26.... this quest is actually waaaayyyy too much and i would appreciate if i could start back where i was. i refuse to play it unless this gets fixed. thank you, and i love the game overall...",4
I‚Äôm addicted to this game I love how you can get new characters but one thing I think they should do is give like 20 or 30 primogems instead of 10 because since you only get four it is a bit hard so just a suggestion my name is lumina in the game because that‚Äôs the name of the female twin and maybe tell them what adventure rank they have to be to do the we will be reunited quest because I‚Äôm too excited and maybe make qiqi a bit easier to get because everyone needs her my dad has her and she awesome!!!!!! So yeah that‚Äôs all I have üëÅ‚ù§Ô∏è genshin impact,5
"So I looove to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild (BOTW) and I decided to play this. One of the best decisions I ever made! I love this and made a vow to play at least an hour of either this of BOTW daily. So awesome!! Maybe make it less glitchy though, because when I go to do something, it kicks me out! Yes I know that this game was made for a PC but maybe you could fix that. Other than that this game is AWESOME!! I am obsessed with it! BTW Maybe you could make it so that you don‚Äôt have to work so hard to get co-op mode and stuff. Just a suggestion!
Update: I love this game but IT WONT GIVE ME VENTI I WANT HIM AND I HAVE WASTED SO MANY PRIMOGEMS ON WHISHES UGGG",5
"I really enjoy playing Genshin. It scratches that RPG itch i‚Äôve been trying to get for years. The only thing that keeps turning me off from actually achieving things is the arbitrarily suffocating, quite pointless and frankly disgusting amount of unskippable dialogue throughout every aspect of the game. You can‚Äôt escape it. Its around every turn, with every quest. The conversations drone on for punishingly long durations, to the point where I‚Äôd rather be getting 30 second Mesothelioma ads. I spend more time sitting here tapping away skipping cutscenes and character conversations that lead nowhere, than I do actually playing the game.",4
"Everything going fine until I hit AR40 and they increase the World Level to 5 (with no warning, otherwise I would have changed my strategy)and all the monsters go up to like level 70+ while my characters are stuck in the 60s, which has made everything practically impossible to complete, which means I can‚Äôt even build up the materials to level up my characters, because everything kills me. So I‚Äôm basically stuck after investing so much time and money into this game, which is really not cool.",5
"I recommend this game highly, especially if you are a fan of rpg, anime, and free roaming games. It‚Äôs styled a lot like Breath Of The Wild to be real, but takes its own twist in the mix. I enjoy how it‚Äôs laid back, and not super grindy. One thing I wish they‚Äôd add was some sort of animal to ride and tame. It would make traveling a lot easier, especially with what little stamina you can have and make it a little more of an easier process. Over all, this is my favorite game at the moment, and will definitely be getting it on Switch if it ever gets on. üíõ",5
"ever since playing on IOS ipad, I frequently had no issues in the beginning until it had started to crash while 30 minutes taken on the game, it kept crashing and crashing after the 30 minutes, I can sit there and come back and game crashed after lagging, periods of glitches, where sometimes on iPhone or iPad, we end up fallen through thin air through the grass and the detail of the grass suddenly disappears and I do lost track where I am, but it gets me annoyed of the crashes, I just needed to be mentioned if anyone else noticed this issue being on iOS but that‚Äôs all I have for you today:D",4
"The quality of this game, from the graphics to gameplay is freaking awesome. I can‚Äôt believe that we come this far in technology where i can play this kind of game on a phone. All the praise go to the developer of this game for giving us such a beautiful and deep story driven game and all the voice acting is spot on also. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this game and can‚Äôt wait to see what the next game will be from this game studio cuz their future looks mighty bright if this game is any indication of their potential. Bravo! Well done",5
"I saw this game in an article that I was reading earlier this morning and had to check it out. This is just jaw dropping for a mobile game. Currently playing this on my 11 inch iPad Pro and it just feels so nice to play a game that is similar to Breath of the Wild. My only complaint so far is that I wish there was controller support for people playing on iPad. It would definitely make the game that much better, but I can see why it hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet as it might be hard to combine the special moves that you acquire later on. All in all, just an amazing piece all together and can‚Äôt wait to see how much further things can go with this.",4
"I played it on pc, I personally like pc better since you can see the full details and graphics on the bigger screen. After playing on pc, I had to download on my phone bc it‚Äôs so addicting! Got my husband hooked on to it too, and he usually don‚Äôt like ‚Äòcute‚Äô graphics. I have to say, the developers did put a lot of thoughts into this game seeing the details of graphics, mechanics, elemental works, weather, etc. I personally think you didn‚Äôt even need to spend money to play this game (not yet atleast, I played for 8 hrs now). Thank you for a great game! It does lag on phone a bit, but pc is awesome!!!",5
"This game is one of a few to deliver a console-quality experience on mobile (and the only one to do it for free). The gameplay is simply amazing, the element system leads to smooth combat, the story and characters are interesting (except Paimon, I hate her), the graphics are beautiful, just everything about this game is fantastic. The exploration, freedom, and pacing are superb. It's like Breath of the Wild but with simpler combat and exploration is rewarded instead of required. I love this game so much, and I will probably end up 100%ing it because it's just so fun. Thank you so much for this mobile port, nothing was lost in translation.",5
"Okay so I started the game maybe like In this year and I did like everything about the game, yes I still am new but the quest and story is beautiful, I still am in Liyue (not in the archon quest tho) But I may accidentally went to Sumaru and when I start to get on genshin my screen is frozen where I can‚Äôt even go to the mailbox or the screen becomes White or just the loading screen elements, but still can hear the ( wonderful) music and even the characters talking. So please can someone tell me what to do or do I delete the game and get it again, that is all (btw stay safe).",4
"I LOVE this game, I‚Äôm not even joking üôÉ but I think other people (especially myself) would love to have those stickers that we have in the chats to be like stickers on Messages or something else. It would be really fun to add on like your next updates. Like say you make the stickers for Messages and one person sends them to another then they would want those stickers but they would have to download the game‚Ä¶ I think you are picking up what I am putting down. Just one more thing those stickers have to be free. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks!!!",5
"Since jan. of 2023, i redownloaded this game, and have played it at least once a day. It helps me bring a bit of life into my daily routine, and i cannot imagine what i would be playing if i never played this game. My first 5* was diluc, which opened up new possibilities of increasing my AR which is currently at 32. A few suggestions for hoyoverse, as well as MiHoyo would be enabling archon quests in co op mode, and possibly in the next patches a free 5* from an event, like Aloy. Love this game, and will definitely be excited to see all the new characters and nations that come ahead.",5
"This game could be one of the greatest games ever made except for it being the stingiest game I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôm not even talking about the summoning system, I‚Äôm talking about just the general gear and upgrade material system. You can grind for weeks using the tiny bit of resin/energy they allow you each day just trying to get a set on one character. And if you actually manage to get the pieces you need with the right sub stats, if they don‚Äôt roll correctly you are out all of your resources- mora and artifacts. Other hero collector games like Epic Seven make it easy to grind and gear many characters while Genshin is an absolute nightmare in this department. It is massively un-user friendly when it comes to gearing units for a game with no real end game content other then‚Ä¶ gearing units. Epic FAIL.",1
THIS IS THE BEST EXPLORING GAME EVER!!!!!!! I am in LOVE with this game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è it is really fun and you get FREE primogems and wishes from time to time!!! Definitely recommend this game if your bored especially if you wanna play it with a friend!! This feature is allowed to add in a UID for adding people or if you wanna be with random people you could unlock CO-OP mode at AR 16 (adventure rank) Adventure rank is mostly when you earn EXP and there is SO MANY characters to choose from!!!! You can get them by wishing fates. (The soft pity is 75 and the GUARANTEED 5 star is 90 pity *pity means how many times you wish* SOFT- 4 star~~ HARD- 5 star) DOWNLOAD THIS GAME FOR CHRING YOUR BOREDOM!!!!,5
"Genshin is an amazing game I want you all to try. It‚Äôs got amazing graphics and stunning gameplay and I love the game with all my heart. The problem is that for broke ppl like me, when you download this game on your phone, it literally takes up 99% of your space and it keeps on updating which honestly makes it worse. To introduce new characters why do we need to keep updating? Why can‚Äôt it just come normally like other games? It‚Äôs so annoying and frustrating to try free up space for this game. Ppl who want to download on mobile, make sure you haven‚Äôt even used your mobileüòÄ",4
"Overall the game is amazing but I think you need to change some things like the resin system, when the games complete how is 160 resin gonna last us at all. Also you should buff ar rewards. Ar 57 rewards are kinda meh. The Sacred Sakura rewards are better, you should also add PvP it would be fun. I‚Äôm also thinking about the KFC glider we were promised but that‚Äôs in the past. You should either improve the welkin drop or increase the commissions rewards because from the welkin you get 90 and from commissions you get a total of 60 and what‚Äôs 90+60 it‚Äôs 150 however you need 160 to wish. Other than that it‚Äôs a really good game but please put it on Nintendo Switch. Also why are we only getting 800 primos for mobile awards hoyoverse you know what happened the last time..",1
"I honestly love Genshin I play it At least 5 days in a week, but I didn‚Äôt rate it 5 stars for a reason. One is getting a 5 star and wasting your money on intertwined fates is one thing, I have personally never gotten a 5 star only 4 stars and note I‚Äôve been playing for At least 5 months that‚Äôs pretty sad. Also the lack of primos you get is mid. You can only get primos from daily‚Äôs and wishes sometimes in battles or chests, but the most you could get from that is 2-4 I really love Genshin though, so no hate just some things that I dislike.",5
"Have had this game for almost two years and never wrote a review! graphics amazing, you can co-op, combat, adventure, storyline, character hangouts, I usually don‚Äôt like gacha games but the way it‚Äôs set up in Genshin is exciting and it makes the game really addicting. I will admit that when I first got this game I had no idea what I was doing at all and I wasn‚Äôt finding it as great as people made it out to be, but once I got to a certain level I got the hang of it and I couldn‚Äôt stop playing it. I really do love everything about it",5
"I dont care what anyone says, Genshin Impact can do better. The colourism in the game is showing. Sumeru, based on south asia, where it tends to have a better skin tone variety. There are only two characters with some pigment. The character ‚ÄúCandance‚Äù is supposed to be based on a African queen and shes lighter than Xinyan, a character mixed with black and asian. Candance should be many shades darker. Hoyoverse obviously has the time and work to research cultures and put in effort, but it seems they only do it for characters with a lighter complexion. The game is greatly animated and the story is semi unique dont get me wrong. But at this point the racism is blatant. Be mad over this review or dont, but they can do better.",3
"As a persian, I hate how Sumeru is based off of the middle-east but somehow the people who design the characters fail to put any representation for darker skinned characters. Out of the 51 characters in genshin currently, 2 of them have slightly darker skin. Nilou‚Äôs design was a good idea but you drastically stereotyped her. You maybe put the slightest bit of effort to research Persian culture and their language to design Nilou but it‚Äôs still a stereotype when you put her in traditional clothes and she doesn‚Äôt even look like she‚Äôs Persian. I don‚Äôt see why you couldn‚Äôt make her skin the slightest bit darker? I know some middle-Easterns are pale but there is darker skinned ones too. Also, why is there no darker skinned npcs? Hoyoverse, you better start being more representative if you intend to include different cultures.",1
"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with some of the character‚Äôs design. As Sumeru leaks are coming out all of the new characters are a pale pasty white. Sumeru is based off Egypt, and it disappoints me that the characters are super pale, rather than at least tan or brown. What disappoints me even more is that even the darkest characters we have, Xinyan and Kaeya, get white washed in official art and have racist stereotypes played onto them as their character. What confuses me is that Hoyoverse can do a great job at representing the cultures that the Nations are based off of (for an example, characters like Yun Jin) but they can‚Äôt make a few characters darker? It makes me sad to see that they prefer the  light skin on EGYPTIAN characters üòï I‚Äôm just not excited to play this game anymore",2
"Never have a regretted spending money on something in my life more. I spent 30 bucks to get 24 rolls, which is honestly a terrible value, what makes it worse is that because it was my first time spending that was double what you normally get and I did the thing that gives you 90 primos a day. And when I spent I basically just got a few repeats of noelle who I dont use because I dont like her playstyle and a sword that is objectively worse than the one I was using. Only consolation was that it got me progress toward pity. Then when I finally hit pity, got my first 5 star, it was again. Something that I have no use for.
Game would be great if you could just buy the characters you want, but as it stands, the gatcha makes it not worth your time or money.",1
"First,Genshin Impact is a really fun game but it‚Äôs usually like that in the earlier states of the game, later on when you‚Äôve finished the story quests,archon quest,commissions etc there‚Äôs really not much to do except events, but events could get boring and feel like a chore to do. So I recommend to listen to the Genshin community and add stuff you think we will like, to put it in short, we need more things to do in the end game but those things can‚Äôt be boring if it‚Äôs boring then we‚Äôll still be bored and not want to do the ‚Äúthing‚Äù.",5
"Honestly this game is the best I‚Äôve ever played. My favorite games consist of Breath of the Wild, Genshin Impact, and Little Nightmares- Genshin is just superior to many and I‚Äôm sorry if I hurt your feelings. The only issue I have is that I have garbage luck üòÇ I have many a Diluc and Rosaria and I don‚Äôt even use them- heck, I‚Äôm AR 54 and I still don‚Äôt have Bennett üò≠ but I deal with it, and I‚Äôm happy with my team, you may think it‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs Chongyun, Venti, Xingqiu and Gorou (yes, Gorou) but thank you Hoyoverse for making such a wonderful game and even though I have bad luck I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever stop playing",5
"For the first week after I downloaded this game I was impressed with the graphics and sound.  It was a sweet escape to a dreamy place. Now every time I try to start my game the connection times out. It‚Äôs not the strength of my internet connection because I don‚Äôt experience this problem with other apps on any of my devices.  It looks like such a fun game, and based on the reviews I don‚Äôt see anyone else complaining about the connection problem, but I‚Äôve searched for support and haven‚Äôt found anything.",5
genshin better bc ‚ÄúI love the story quest and the lore behind characters and things I find if so amazing how they added all of that and especially the games animation is beautiful it‚Äôs one of them reason I never get bored and don‚Äôt get me started with the events they are so wonderful but the game does have its downfalls like the gacha system it‚Äôs not the best and the community can be bad at times but other than that the game is wonderful they have frequent updates and add new things to keep the players intrigued‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why I love boys‚Äù,5
"I love the game and it‚Äôs adventures, like shrines, characters, coop, bosses, and more! But there is one issue I wish that could change and it is the wishing system. 5 star characters are only guarnteed at 80 wishes total, which is a long way, primo gems are really hard to earn and 1 wish is 160 primo gems! This really pisses me off. To earn one character you needs lot of wishes, like 7 or 10 or something. I hope mihoyo will make the wishing system easier ( I think all unlucky wishing people want this) Overall, the game is pretty great, but the wishing system could use some improvement.",4
"Honestly this game is so fun to play. You can do many different things from exploration, story quests, side quests, co-op, gacha, building characters amongst others. Even getting the stuff to build characters is made fun and to play when bored. The gacha part of the game is probably my favorite also kind of addictive lol. As a free player it is possible to play without paying and it‚Äôs one of the best features of the game. That‚Äôs not even the surface of the game. If you are thinking of playing the game I highly recommend it!",5
At first it was pretty good but then it just got bad. This game is just all luck base and won‚Äôt give you a chance when farming artifacts. Farming artifacts are hard because it‚Äôs all luck and people that don‚Äôt have good luck are at a disadvantage. If you want to make this a better game then make it less harder. Farming primos are also hard. Once you do that you have nothing else to do and it gets super boring. I get really attached to games but this one was just hard to get attached to. This games fandom is trash and is probably the worst. I let people join me and I‚Äôm open anytime if anyone wants to play with me. So I let these group of 3 people join me and they all told me kill my self and were also very toxic. Overall if your finding a new game to play don‚Äôt play this one.,1
"Your game is a great one my favorite even, but your starting to make the enemies to strong, we‚Äôre only on inuzuma so this is concerning to me, I would like to set the coming up weekly boss baal. This weekly boss has 1.4 million hp and it‚Äôs a little over powered it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre fighting the final boss of the game in khanria. Please take your bosses and enemies down a notch players who aren‚Äôt enjoying the game by making their damage higher would be greatly affected by this so from a player who‚Äôs played for almost a year now stop making them over the top strong.",5
"i love the game for its ability to be able to capture the exploration and aesthetic of its landscape very well, only problem is that the rewards systems are worse than other gacha games i‚Äôve seen and the rates to get said rewards are puny. i‚Äôd LOVE to see how mihoyo can improve on this and give more to its player base. 
what‚Äôs more is that this game takes an entire half of my storage already as it is. i‚Äôd appreciate it if there was a way to compact it into a smaller file, but i can see why it can‚Äôt. 
overall, i recommend this to someone with at LEAST 13+ gigs to spare (no joke that‚Äôs the actual amount it‚Äôs taking out of my storage, out of 32) and loves exploring lol",3
"I‚Äôm gonna be honest the game is good, I love the scenery and I also love the characters but the fact I been grinding a year everyday is making me rush content burned out just because I want a character I want is ridiculous cause the banners leave after a week, which also leads me too spend 500 dollars just for that character also the fact the anniversary reward is the most saddest thing in existence if I had too give the worst anniversary rewards trophy of all time I have to give it too this game. Like fr tho even a hentai gacha game gives out better rewards than this game (taimanin rpgx) two star for its great gameplay but I wouldn‚Äôt rather rate it at all for the gacha and rewards aspect of the game.",2
"Honestly if we disregard the rest of the community let‚Äôs be real! You have a very cute game! There are things that we would like to be fixed but it is what it is. It takes time to get where other games are. But that‚Äôs not the point the point is to have fun love learn and grow. We all make mistakes and we all don‚Äôt get crucified for it. You have a whole plan out there, if we had a timeline like we can see it would be better. But as long as you love, nurture, and grow, that‚Äôs what matters. Just make sure to keep improving and we will stay!",5
"I have a love/hate relationship with Genshin impact  at this point. On the one hand, I am absolutely enthralled with the exploration, characters, and story of this beautiful game. On the other, there has been no endgame development since launch, a good portion last few characters have been disappointing, and almost all decisions made since the release of inazuma have been for the negative. It feels like Mihoyo has stopped listening to the cries of their player base which is disappointing considering their previous attention to meticulous game balancing and reward distribution. Sadly, it seems that this trend will continue if nothing is done. I truly do want this to be a game I‚Äôm able to enjoy for years to come, and I hope that the talented devs at mihoyo can realize what‚Äôs going wrong. Cheers",1
"It would be a 5 star review if it wasn‚Äôt for the anniversary. Genshin is an amazing game, one of if not my favorite game, but with lack of communication between developers and players, the game feels like it doesn‚Äôt have a future to look forward to. I am AR 56 and have another account in AR 32. For them to have done this to their player base is disappointing to say the very least. As a player that is on almost every day and has spent money on it this current dilema has made me think of quitting the game and find some other company that does care about all their players. It hurt to leave a bad review but if this is the only way to get mihoyo to listen and understand that we as a community deserve better then it must be done. I hope I can change this review sooner rather than later.",1
"I have been playing genshin for not a long time, I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like RPG games until I found Genshin Impact. When I saw the graphics, storyline, characters. EVERYTHING is perfect. Something I would like is the weapon gacha to work like the promotional character gacha, so this way is easier for the person. One person spent like $4K for homa, but they never got it. So I would really like if MiHoyo could fix that. Other than that, I think this game is perfect if you‚Äôre looking for an RPG game with good graphics, storyline, characters, scenes, anything.

Thanks for reading my review!! <33",5
HONESTLY this game is amazing in basically in one week I got to level 20 this game is honestly fun to play with friends as well but it gets boring and you just gotta have good luck and that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt rlly have I have spend at least 50 dollars and I don‚Äôt have any 5 star charters another thing is that it takes to much battery so u gotta keep charging ur phone over and over bUT i love the 4 star characters there honestly amazing I recommend this game but don‚Äôt do like me and play 7 days straight cuz ur gonna get bored at some poiNt BUT I RECOMMEND IT SO MUCH!!,5
"Update: now that this game supports a controller, it feels like a triple A console game. Obviously not a next gen system but could easily pass for an older system. Graphics and controls are great. It blows my mind that you can play this for free. Of course you can spend money to help you progress faster but honestly, this game is so smooth I don‚Äôt mind the taking a longer route for free. Story is fun, voice acting is A+. There‚Äôs not much else to say. It‚Äôs definitely worth your time to see if it‚Äôs for you. This game has set a sky high bar for mobile games.",5
"I have been playing the game since release on my PC. Even after taking a long few month break period, I am still in shock as to how much great content we are given. Do not get me wrong, even on phone the game is absolutely beautiful and still a very enjoyable experience. My only problem with the game in its current state is Ressin being used as a time gate to how much you can play the game or more so make progression for your adventure rank and for making your characters stronger. Overall, I‚Äôd give the a solid 10/10 or 5 Stars. Great work Mihoyo!",5
"I cannot describe how surprised I was at how good this game is. My best friend started playing it and called it an ‚Äúanime styled breath of the wild‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt believe her because of previous hyped up immobile games that didn‚Äôt make the cut, but on this one she was right. The only thing I would change is the lack of a faster way to get around without teleporting, since navigating the parts of the map you haven‚Äôt activated the teleporters in yet can be tedious. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs literally it. I love this game and highly recommend it for fellow dorks.",5
"The story, the graphics, the art, the characters, the colors, the gameplay, 10/10 if you‚Äôre someone who wants a good game to play with adventure fairytale aspects amazing characters amazing controls and last but not least addictive fun game this is the game for you. I started playing this game thinking I would probably quit after a couple minutes, I ended up playing it for hours (with breaks of course) this game is also in my opinion appropriate for almost all ages (depending on what you see is an appropriate) do you have some time to spend I suggest to play this game it‚Äôs fun!",5
"There are so many great aspects of Genshin, and what few downsides there are I barely notice. The Dev team seems to take feedback seriously, and the 1.2 update addresses lots of the issues the player base has had. The world and art is beautiful, the combat flows smoothly and each character feels different to play, the stories are funny and compelling, and even the most common enemies are unique instead of the bog standard giant spiders every other fantasy world has. At Adventure Rank 42 I‚Äôm still loving the game and motivated to keep exploring. Come join us in Teyvat!",5
"This is by far one of the most visually captivating games- their attention to detail is amazing! Characters are interesting, story is interesting, weapons are cool. There are only two gripes I have:

1. It takes a ridiculous amount of time and effort to level up in rank. It gets really cumbersome and makes gameplay more of a chore than an enjoyable experience. 

2. They‚Äôre not always clear on rules or limitations. I bought a Battle Pass thinking it would stay for the rest of my gameplay and the countdown was for the available weapons. Nope, the $20 and the countdown was for helping reach rank but after the countdown you would start from scratch and need to pay $20 again if you wanted a boost. Idk if that was clear, but it was pretty lame. But even on some of the newer side quests, they‚Äôre not always very clear on what is expected.

All that said, I would STILL highly recommend the game. :)",5
"initially saw ads for the game on my Social media platform under anime like content. My initial thought was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just gonna be some sort of bootleg JRPG, that doesn‚Äôt work well on the phone.‚Äù Boy was I wrong, it really works!  The game graphics are beautiful, the open world aspect is awesome, the characters are unique in their own fighting style, design and personalities, and for the cherry on top... they are graphically designed to look like any modern anime protagonist. For those who like the ‚ÄúBreath of the Wild‚Äù.  I highly recommend this game!  Note:  The download does take quite a few gigabytes to run.",5
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME RIGHT NOW‚ù§Ô∏èit‚Äôs such a good game and I don‚Äôt play mobile games often. I often get headaches from having to hold the phone near my face. Today I was hoping there was some type of controller compatibility so I connected my controller to my phone but there wasn‚Äôt‚òπÔ∏èü•∫I definitely think that is something that should be added to the game in a later update!! I love the game and the story line. Probably the first story line I‚Äôve actually read and never skipped through. There‚Äôs always something to do and the characters are so adorable. Keep it up!! Add that controller compatibility!!,5
So Genshin Impact out of nowhere blew up and it caught my attention when everyone was saying the ads are exactly like the game. So I tried to install Genshin Impact and is took a while to download hunting to me it was not some crappy game made in an hour. When I open it I am greeted with a full black screen and so I wait thinking this is the loading screen. Then the screen turns half whiter and half black and kicks me out. It may be IOS14 or It‚Äôs because I have a iPhone se which is on the older side. But it all in all kicks me out. So a couple days later it comes up again and I think maybe the bug is resolved so I do the same process and get the same bug. Then I do this about 2 more times till now where I am opening the app now to see if it will load. If I can edit these I will and post the results.,1
"The game is solid. 5 star for gameplay, lore, music and graphics. Storyline itself is... generic and basic? The media production is incredible when announcing new characters and soundtrack. Just don't get your hopes up on rewards or from the Genshin team marketing within the expansive company called Mihoyo. You can spend a lot of time and little received for month to month gameplay. Events are plentiful for those few days it happens but very dry in terms of gacha. At least there's a guarantee rate system better than other games I've played. Weapons banner I'm not looking at you.",4
"I am a fan of gacha games. I‚Äôve played a few of them, and they come with a lot of ups and downs. Some of them have really cool characters, but bad battle systems, others you have to constantly grind to get things and end up getting nothing. It all comes down to luck. What I like about this game, however, is that every item has its own little story, each character with their own unique traits. It really makes you feel like you‚Äôre a part of the game, getting to know these people. Honestly one of the best games I have played, I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"This game is incredible! The graphics are beautiful, the story is great and the characters are so lovable. I was really bored before I found this game and have nothing bad to say about it, but if i was gonna recommend anything it‚Äôd be having your own house or apartment.. it‚Äôd be nice to have everything u need in one area plus I‚Äôd be tired of running around searching for boar meat too üòÖ 
also more available costumes/skins for both our main and other characters. But anyways I love this game if anyone is looking for a great game to play I‚Äôd highly recommend this! üíô",5
When installed the game and I opened the app it was first all white than half of it turn black than it took off the app itself so I waste more data to re install it again alit work but now when I try to see the story of the brother and sister is all glitch and it‚Äôs stops in one certain part while the stories continues and I decided to install full but still when I started to explore my surroundings were black I couldn‚Äôt see only when I move I could see my surroundings but only saw my surroundings like a bubble I only keep moving so I can see but if I didn‚Äôt I only blackness only the place I am standing only see grass and also waited if it fix itself but it never did so idk if it‚Äôs a bug or something but can y‚Äôall see what‚Äôs wrong with it,1
"I expected the game to have bugs/glitches. Yet, their weren‚Äôt any! I grateful it had no problems. Especially with the download, took about an hour. (It‚Äôs a big game.) The beginning of the story is very interesting. If you‚Äôre interested in adventure games. This surely is the game for you. Story of the game is perfect, the graphics, character designs, character development, overall. The variety of power ups/cool powers! Really, if you‚Äôre looking for a long anime styled type adventure game. This is the game for you. No questions asked. I leave my review here as i am happy with the download/game in general.

"Put simply, this is what I expected when I played Honkai Impact 3, and what it tried to accomplish is some regards

The world is so expansive, I nearly got lost during the tutorial, and that's a good thing! It shows how much effort was put into making this game as open world as possible. 

My only complaint is that, at least in the early game, there's no mid ground in traversing the landscape. You are either doing a leasurly jog or teleporting across the map with way points, but the game is so beautiful and full of extra content that there's always something to do while you explore and travel",5
"Genshin Impact is hands down the funnest game I‚Äôve ever played in a long time, the art and style of the way that it was created is so beautiful! Also the people that‚Äôs on here are so friendly (even though most are on high lvls they still come to your world to try and help you!)If your looking for a game that is/has beautiful artwork, kind and gentle people, something to take off your stress and boredom, then Genshin Impact is the one for you. Oh! And if you like role play then this has great people for that :D Safe travels to all, - Satan‚Äôs lover",5
"I love genshin,  played it for a few years at this point,  but the pity system failed me.  I was on 55 pity as I‚Äôve counted.  I did 10 or so long long ago,  but the history wouldn‚Äôt go back far enough to see it.  Regardless,  I was on 45 pity.  I had over 10k primos saved and 14 intertwined fates.  The weapon banners pity can only go 80,  right? Well,  minus 45 and I only need about 35 more wishes till I‚Äôd get my 5 star weapon,  right? Well,  i spent not only my 14 wishes but around 6k primos on it.  That‚Äôs definitely past 80,  impossible.  And I didn‚Äôt even win the weapon I wanted.  I spend hours playing it everyday and it‚Äôs simply upsetting for this to happen.  Aside that,  the game is good.",3
"To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt too interested in this game when I first started playing it. But, as the game progressed, I started enjoying it more and more- And now I‚Äôm totally in love with it! It just gets more fun with every update, new quest, etc.. The animation is beautiful, and I adore the characters! The gameplay and elemental reactions are so interesting and fun. 
If I could add one thing to the game, I would definitely add skins for more/all of the characters! 
I would especially love to see a new skin for Tartaglia (Childe). 
Thank you so much HoYoVerse, for developing this wonderful game! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï",5
"this game has been probably the best one i‚Äôve ever played by far, the graphics, character design, gameplay, has exceeded all expectations. but the only ‚Äúcomplaints‚Äù that i have are once you reach a certain point in game where you‚Äôve explored every region, completed all abyss, and finished all quests/hangouts, even maxing out the teapot, there‚Äôs nothing much to do other than logging on, doing resin, commissions, expeditions, bounties/requests if you‚Äôre desperate, then logging right off. and even then, it seems more of a chore than a game. the second a new quest comes out, it doesn‚Äôt take more than 3 days to finish and waiting for the next update taking about a month can be tedious and boring. the rates for weapons specifically ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù weapons make it so you have to get 2 weapons and THEN another weapon (the one of the epitomized fate)

update: same plot just recycled over and over again
turns my phone into a toaster
character designs are really uncreative
sumeru is a mess of cultures just mashed into one area",3
"I‚Äôve been playing genshin since about the time it came out, the characters and the lore have never ceased to amaze me. The lack of representation in this game is what appalled me, the way the POC in the community beg and beg for it, even more now with Sumeru and they white-wash a character that literally is based off a black woman, and yes i know many games in China do this, Many many many people in Asia are racist, not all,  but quit a lot of them are which is the cause for this problem the lack of listening to the people who actually play their game is nasty and it has led me to barely play it now as it is saddening, i recommend the game just don't give the company money.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game on and off since October of 2020, and honestly seeing how this game turned out really upsets me.

I think I‚Äôll start with a more personal, smaller gripe of mine; travel. Why is the only two modes of travel (not including swimming/boats) walking or waypoints? This game isn‚Äôt the funniest to explore and I think things like horses or mounts would be really beneficial to this game and I can take everything in a lot better!

Now, sumeru, because honestly it‚Äôs been the one thing making me back away from this game and really showed the cracks. The lack of diversity, the whole region being a monolith for many cultures to the point is meshes. How come throughout this 2-year game run-time none of this team can bother giving darker-skin tone characters. Why is tighnari MY skin tone, why is the dendro archon literally whiter than me; She‚Äôs a sheet of paper! You guys need to address this and do better. You‚Äôre disrespecting so many people by this lack of rep and overall lack of communication.

The Hoyoverse has hardly ever listens to its fans and this whole region proves it.",2
"I love the game but the more you progress the less you have a chance to get wishes. I think you should cut down the price of primogems, doesn‚Äôt have to be a lot either. Or at least give higher ranks more quests because we don‚Äôt get a lot anymore with a lot of stuff at 100% exploration. Just a small question you don‚Äôt have too. Also one small question, it would be cool if you could get traveler to use different kinds of weapons and get points to use it better ( that would be cool )",5
"First off, I absolutely adore this game. I‚Äôve played Genshin Impact since it‚Äôs original launch. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to play it any longer due to the amount of space it currently takes up on my device and in the future. This is an issue that needs to be fixed because the game won‚Äôt be playable for many people who are in my shoes and in that respect, the game will be losing valuable customers. I hope something can be done, I seriously doubt anything WILL be done but I needed to vent.",5
"I love this game it‚Äôs one of my favorites ever the controller support is great the graphics are awesome and the story is amazing although I do wish that maybe in the future there could be an option to create a character where you can pick it‚Äôs skills and elements and weapons it uses. Just a suggestion the game‚Äôs character right now are great but maybe you could use that feature in a multiplayer mode or something. Also PVP would be cool to add to,other than that I love the game definitely recommend to people who like anime or rpg games",5
"I really like the game it self I am a day one player and I still play to this day, but mihoyo is extremely money hungry and you can really tell with the anniversary. I didn‚Äôt have very high expectations from the start but this is way worse then I expected, to start it off they weren‚Äôt planning on giving people pretty much anything but now that people start to complain they decide to actually give us stuff. The only reason why we actually got anything is because the ratings are plummeting. I personally will continue to play the game but I will never drop another penny into mihoyos pocket. I feel like the anniversary rewards really shows their values and in my opinion puts a very bad face on the company. That‚Äôs just my little rant about how sick I am with mihoyo.",1
I love this game BUT this game gives me anger issues like bro I just wanna play but there‚Äôs always that one boss that I can‚Äôt defeat and I have to keep feeding my characters NEXT THING YOU KNOW IS THAT THERE FULL BUT THERE STILL DYINGüò≠ I play on PS4 and I really just wanna throw the control at the tv some times I don‚Äôt have many characters because I have bad luck when wishing BUT I only like swords people don‚Äôt get me wrong the other characters are useful but not towards meü•≤ when I have Missions in the snow I wanna cry I always have to be near fire or else I‚Äôll die you wanna know how many times I almost died trying to find fireü•≤over all this game is good ig:),4
"I played every single day for almost a year, to find out that the only game they want to give rewards to is Honkai. They get all these awesome rewards for anniversary, and I just thought maybe with the fact that they bring in hundreds of millions of dollars on a regular basis, and how I‚Äôve probably dropped a good $500 on the game, that they may treat their players a little better. But it‚Äôs getting worse and worse as time goes on. You bought your entire staff apple products, but want to offer a $5 reward to take the rights to peoples art. This isn‚Äôt okay. You‚Äôre screwing artists, writers, and creatives in general with these new contests. I may uninstall and that makes me sad tbh, but I‚Äôd rather buy a full game then hope for the best with you when the disappoint continues to  grow",1
"Okay, I‚Äôm only some middle schooler who has barely any time to play this, but the game is amazing! The graphics are really good, and the story line is so good! I have two separate accounts, one on the PS4, and one on the phone, so I can play throughout the entire week, and so I can play more. One of which I have more luck on. I‚Äôd also like to say the wishing system is pretty nice too! I just have a bit of trouble getting primogens since I can‚Äôt exactly buy one since I‚Äôm too young to have a job, but yknow, I find a way! Anyways, I‚Äôd really recommend this game!",5
"The game is mostly great, it‚Äôs just that the character designs are really lacking in variety. All the characters released so far are young and cute looking. Even the players avatar is stuck as a scrawny kid. Lately things have been getting worse as the game has only been spamming banners with sexualized female characters the last several months. The female character roster is double the size of the male roster. At this rate the game will be just another stale ‚Äúwaifu simulator‚Äù. Which is a shame considering the game has a lot of potential and the company has enough support to be more creative. It would not hurt for them to add some elderly characters, muscular warriors, goofy looking meme characters, and etc. once in a while. Instead of just making sexualized female characters with the occasional pretty boy.",1
"It‚Äôs really good and all the 1 star reviews are complaining about that there device has terrible specs and they did not get a character they want. Now you do need a relatively strong device to be able to run it but if you do Congrats you found what seems to be a triple A game for free! Now there is micro transactions but they are not forced. One thing though is can you please make the wishes cost less or make 5 stars more common. 

Update
I can‚Äôt fit the new update so please find a way to compress the game to a lower gigabyte capacity so I can continue playing the best free game out there",4
"alr so , i love this game alot honestly its so addicting . but when i  press icons like , - ( wish , character list , party setup ) it kicks me out of the whole app i have tried deleting apps , photos - still disconnect ‚Äò s me , and i have a good connection to the game . i try to ignore it but it ‚Äò s recently been getting on my nerves so , i tried deleting more . it still has ‚Äò nt worked . idrk if its a glitch \ bug . maybe its just me . but just my experience . i do recommend you to try the app though its honestly really cool - . anyways thanks for reading this ^^ .",5
"Now listen, I get that there is a teleportation system and all but i‚Äôd love to have a mount. I think having a mount that could fly or even just a mount on land would be dope. I also think you should implement a diving system that could allow the player to glide faster and farther. Like you jump off a cliff dive downwards and then back up do your gliding faster and further. I also think the animation for gliding seems...just meh. Other than that I don‚Äôt have any issues with the game it‚Äôs great and all, totally recommend it to any and all anime fans. I only gave a 4 star review because there aren‚Äôt any mounts and the gliding is just to plain.",4
"So far this game is the best Role playing game that I have ever experienced. I love how detailed everything is, and I love how each character has a different background story. I also think each character is super unique, from the different clothing patterns to the the way that they walk! This is the best game I have ever played in my life. To be honest it‚Äôs quite addicting. Please don‚Äôt download this if you have a hard time concentrating on your school work it will rob you of your time and money! :D Thank you so much for creating this game!!! This is like the BEST FRIGGIN GAME EVER!!!! üíñüíñüíñ",5
"This is such a good game, the graphics are always a pleasing sight to see and although rates seem based you have to admit they are significantly better than most gacha games that offer weapons. And although chances of getting the character you want are low there‚Äôs no need to worry because you‚Äôre likely to find one and Fall in love with them regardless!! The unique battle styles and slight differences in fighting techniques based off region and all the little details you see such as noises, background chatter, lively npc‚Äôs, it brings the game together.. and It‚Äôs wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I do not have enough words do describe how much I love this game, I currently run this on mobile and I did not expect a full pc game packed into this. The graphics and play style on mobile is so amazing and smooth and works amazingly. I love the interesting mechanics of dragon spine and the different boss fights. The story is amazing and I‚Äôm genuinely so interested in the lore, I love all of the characters personalities and designs. I‚Äôve literally been playing since the childe banner and haven‚Äôt stopped the wish system just keeps you coming back. I have so much praise for this game and it‚Äôs definitely a one of a kind.",5
"It‚Äôs a facade, the graphics are ok but once you start getting into the game it‚Äôs just boring, the story is boring and other then the story there‚Äôs nothing to do, this is a breath of the wild fraud or should I say breath of the weeaboo, the gacha system is bad and the characters are not even that interesting and especially the main character like the main character don‚Äôt even talk, it‚Äôs free to play but it will take forever to level up once you get deep in the game, you anime fans need to really look at what your playing, this game just has quality in graphics but not in story,  gameplay, and enemies. They just what your money and stop playing this game just because there are ‚Äúwaifus‚Äù as you guys say it there is no build up or quality in characters. Stop wasting your money and buy an actual quality game",1
"I personally really like Genshin Impact. The graphics, character designs, story line, everything is just amazing. Ive been playing for about 3 weeks and I am really attached. I have seen reviews saying the game wouldn‚Äôt load. For those who don‚Äôt know, Genshin Impact has 3D models for characters and the resolution is overall, pretty high. Some devices may not me able to handle that. I have an iPhone 7 but play on an iPad 7th gen (for a larger screen). If none of your devices will load the game, I suggest trying on PC, Ps4, or any other gaming formats. But overall, I really recommend this game for anyone ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"This game is one of the best mobile/pc online games I have ever played. It has amazing graphics, amazing character designs, and amazing story lines. I love how you can both pay to win and also play for free and still be successful. At this point I am AR 33 and I have 1 5 star and all of the 4 stars besides for Bennett and Sucrose, which I have gotten all of for free. I highly recommend this game. One issue I have though is that I feel like trading should be implemented in a way people cannot get scammed, and that getting amounts of XP for ranking up in AR level should be easier. But overall, Amazing game!",5
"So this game is absolutely amazing, I highly recommend it although it is quite addicting. The only problem I have with it is music. Even though the set soundtrack for the game is really nice, sometimes I want to listen to my own music while I play. Even if you go to setting and turn the sound all the way down, you still can‚Äôt play music. This is slightly annoying since I have to connect to a different device to listen while I play. Still, this game is beautifully made and is definitely one of my favorite things to spend my time playing now.",5
"I don't think I have anything to say that hasn't been said already. It runs beautifully on my iPad Pro, and it's especially nice to be able to adjust the graphics to adjust performance. The only thing I would like is controller support for this mobile version. It would make playing on something like an iPad Pro so much better, since it has more screen real estate, and with stands and keyboards, notably the magic keyboard for iPad Pro, makes it feel like I'm playing PC games on my PC... except it'd be playing mobile games, like these ESPECIALLY, on my iPad Pro!",5
"This game is amazing, there‚Äôs so much to do. Main quests, side quests, daily quests, an enormous map to explore, numerous monsters to fight, puzzles to solve for rewards, NPCs everywhere, love-able playable characters, and options to play a completely free game with no purchases! The only issue I‚Äôve had with the game is some crashes when I teleport into a large city, other than that perhaps a fast draining battery. Though, that can be easily fixed by lowering the graphics quality. Those would be my only complaints. 5 stars all around.",5
"The game itself is much larger than I anticipated for a phone game. I‚Äôm sad that you can‚Äôt play interchangeably between platforms, phone to ps4 and vice versa. That would be pretty awesome in order to play on the go, but maybe in the future? 
The controls are a little smushed, but it‚Äôs to be expected since it‚Äôs on a phone. 
The characters are well developed, the gameplay is dynamic, the worlds are very beautifully crafted. I‚Äôve only recently started playing, but have already made a lot of progress. You would think it would be harder to pick up, but it‚Äôs pretty intuitive! 
If you played Skyrim or games like it, and you enjoyed it, then you‚Äôll definitely love this game. 
My one critique would be that the menus are a bit convoluted. There are a ton of ways to get to everything, but they aren‚Äôt all easily deciphered. I still have great difficulty finding the daily log to
Check in and get my daily boost. Seriously, it‚Äôs frustrating.",5
"The game itself is actually very good! Graphics are amazing and character design as well as story are remarkable however, I believe I‚Äôve found a bug. When attempting to download the extra data via inside the game it tells me I have no storage and it can‚Äôt be downloaded even after clearing out my phone and checking, deleting, and closing out the game multiple times- I know I have more than enough storage with 200GB of space but it still tells me otherwise?? I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug or not but I can‚Äôt seem to actually play the game because of this.",4
"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin... this game is unbelievable! For those of you out there who have reduced this in your mind to being nothing more than a Zelda: Breath of the Wild clone I would dare you to try it for yourself. It is so much more! Heavily inspired, true, but it has enough of its own identity to stand apart. A breathtaking world filled to the brim, just waiting to be explored. Fast paced, engaging combat with rewarding equipment customization. A rich, interesting story that will keep you hooked. There‚Äôs something here for everyone, and being free to play (not even pay to win) there‚Äôs no excuse not to try.",5
"I have been playing this for about 3 days now and I absolutely love this game. I have been looking for a good rpg style free roam forever and I came across this while scrolling through Snapchat, and I thought I could give it a try. Long story short, I really underestimated how good the gameplay was, and how amazing the graphics and textures are. I like how much it resembles Zelda Breath Of the Wild as far as combat goes. But the thing that tops this off is that you can use elemental skills to defeat your enemies. I can‚Äôt wait to see this game become huge",5
"The game play is really great, more of the same from a great phone game dev. The characters are very cool and feel different from each other. But like my title I feel the system this game uses to fund itself is a huge scam. It charges an overt amount for people to roll for characters, with less than 1% chance to get what you actually want. Especially during these hard pandemic times it is such a shame to see such blatant thievery from hard working people to gamble their money away. I hope the devs fix their monitization of this game and really allow for a wider audience to enjoy the beautiful stunning world they have built. Final note from playing the start is a little slow, but after you finish the start area the game lets you explore more and is just amazing.",2
"People have got to stop giving this game low stars just for a laugh or because they didn‚Äôt get their desired character. I doubted this game at first but after playing the quests I fell in love with the character designs and stories. The animation and graphics are the best I‚Äôve ever seen and each story is thrilling. I also love the open world part since I don‚Äôt have to be stuck in just one place and enjoy touring around the landscapes, including designing my teapot. Overall it‚Äôs a great game and experience I hope everyone can enjoy.",5
"When I first started Genshin impact, I remember how bad I was at the game. I used to think we were able to collect every character if we did all the quests - so I stayed up all night to do the Stormterror  quest. I also remember my very first main. It was Xingqiu. I used to be embarrassed that I mained him cause he wasn‚Äôt a 5* and I thought I was the only one who used him. But now I‚Äôm AR 58 and I main Our trusty lawyer Yanfei. This game has always been in my heart. But playing Genshin now will never feel the same when I played it for the first time. <3",5
"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews, but THIS GAME. Maybe it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm a loser and have no social life, but this game is my relief and refuge. I recommend this to anyone who liked Zelda, Breath Of The Wild. I personally think it has a more engaging story line, beautiful graphics, and characters with SUCH personality. Honestly, I‚Äôm impressed at how well this game is made and maintained. Thank you, Mihoyo, because wow. This game feels like it‚Äôll always be there for me.
(However, i feel the characters lack representation cus guys the new characters are literally glowing with whiteness pls just add some POC characters)",5
So I play on one of the newest iPhones and snide it‚Äôs an iPhone the battery power is not so great I have Genshin on my computer and ps5 so I know the game though am not sure if they can fix it also it‚Äôs hard to even get good primogems also for people saying it takes up too much storage there‚Äôs nothing the developer can do about it the more they update it the more space it takes for quality that‚Äôs just how it works so maybe try getting it on a more compatible device if you can anyways that‚Äôs the end good luck for people wanting 50/50,4
"TOF user has no clue what they‚Äôre talking about when they say better games. daylight being lazy and not work for your stuff but yeah I do understand why menu bedroom players needs better game thing I do a group. 

I do wish the developer of this game will take veteran players into consideration when building future updates so it can be a better experience for everybody. this complaint has been going around for ages I do hope it gets addressed but other than that it gets a fire for newcomers.",5
This game is amazing but there is one problem I have been stuck with for the last 2 months. So when you reach Adventure rank 25 you have to do this test to move on and it happens every time you rank up 10 times the tests are really hard to beat and some of them are timed I have not been able to beat the last boss for the last 2 months I spend 1 hour each time doing the Challenge and so far no changes maybe make the changes a little more easy and have a different boss for the end that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking thank you for reading this,4
"Game is great, awesome open world with cool enemies, characters, and quests. Kinda feels like if you mashed TES IV: Oblivion into BOTW. Everyone jokes about going bankrupt paying for stuff but you can get lots of characters without paying a dime. The only reason this game doesn‚Äôt have a solid 5 stars on the App Store is the losers giving the game one star complaining about ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù and ‚Äúxenophobia‚Äù because they don‚Äôt have any POC in the game (even though they literally do). These people don‚Äôt understand the game, don‚Äôt listen to their stupid reviews",5
The story and graphics of this game is actually stunning for it to be free for the most part. I haven‚Äôt played it in about 4 months because of the storage issue but what upsets me the most is the fact there are so many regions and the game introduces different cultures yet they refuse to have more variety with the characters‚Äô skin tones and body types?? Only 2 characters have tan skin out of all of the rest and it doesn‚Äôt make sense considering one of the regions it would make more sense if their skin is darker because of climate‚Ä¶.disappointed but not surprised i just can‚Äôt support the company anymore. the game gets boring if one of the main things; gacha is what keeps the fandom going and you make them all look the same with different clothes.,1
"Genshin impact is a great game overall it has cute characters, fun adventures, new updates all the time, etc. but the thing is, the genshin impact developers don‚Äôt treat their fans with respect. There has been so many instances where they just completely ignore the wishes of the community. Currently with sumeru on its way, many of the upcoming characters have been leaked. Almost all these characters are pale/white. This does not represent the many cultures which inspired sumeru. If you want to incorporate different cultures into your game, don‚Äôt pick and chose. Actually add characters that will make sense and make the people from these cultures feel represented. This is an act against people of color. And if you want people to enjoy your game, listen to your community.",1
"Okay, here we go. Genshin impact is an AMAZING game with lore, open world exploring, challenges weekly to daily, cute fun characters come on banners for 3 weeks at most if no delay. BUT, the one thing I wanna see happen with this game is to MAKE MORE DARKER SKIN TONES! Honestly, we all should‚Äôve said something AWHILE back so HoYoverse could hear us, but we waited too long. They wont change the models designs, but we really wish they could add new five stars with darker skin tones. They are still POC, which is rep for POC, but‚Ä¶ WE WANT DARKER SKIN TONES. Not everyone is allergic to melanin. HoYoverse is amazing at game designing, modeling, researching cultures, creating characters, writing lore, making challenges so the game isn‚Äôt dry. What they lack is skin tone diversity. Download the game, but help us make change with the game.",2
"Titles confusing, but, hear me out. The game is amazing, cool characters, beautiful world, and with INAZUMA out, you‚Äôll never run out of things to do. I must warn you; the game will eventually start feeling like a something on your to do list. It ruined my mental health for a long time. It‚Äôs not deep, but this game drags on and makes me feel anxious, because you have daily tasks. I feel that I don‚Äôt have a choice and I have to do my daily tasks. It‚Äôs horrible. It‚Äôs ruining me. If you are going to ignore my negative comments, that‚Äôs fine, the game is very beautiful though.",5
"‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è the download takes a while, leave your phone screen on with the app open while downloading

buuuut on with the review.... this game is the best!! i love it so much, if you've ever played Zelda Breath of the Wild, this is very much like that, with the added elemental powers. speaking of those, i like how they work together and the elements make combos to deal more DMG. i've only had this game a week or so, but i love it! the whole wishes thing to get new characters is pretty confusing, but i'll figure it out, and so will you!

‚ú®you will be addicted to this game!‚ú®",5
Ok so I do it on a mobile phone/ iPhone and I can‚Äôt even play the game no real problem is it was going to take all my phone data storage because of how much it had to put in there so I can play it I can‚Äôt even play it that‚Äôs why and it‚Äôs so annoying I feel like you don‚Äôt even read any of the reviews and I didn‚Äôt even update it! I would not recommend this for any kids or anyone because you can speak and if your young you may share information and you can get hacked or tracked so please make a chat and no mics and have the chat with hashtags that will block personal information like age address    and phone numbers please make this better and I will read any response and reviews to see if I change my mind. One star,1
"Genshin offers an open world exploration that I can‚Äôt find in any other mobile game. I can play with my friend who‚Äôs on ps5 and the gacha is forgiving enough get units I really want if I save up for them. Four stars are viable in this game, and there are tons of weapons to craft and ways to build characters. The game is not perfect, but it has room for improvement. It‚Äôs really the community that ruins the experience. So for a new player, I strongly recommend beginning the experience far away from the toxic environment this game can create.",5
"This game is a blast, great graphics, great combat system, and a pretty great story to go with it. 

The two biggest problems (at least in my opinion) are the gacha system and the amount of storage the game takes up. 

The gacha system makes it very challenging for free to play players to get the character they want. With only around a .06% chance of getting a 5 star character the game basically forces you to make 90 wishes and get the soft pity where it gives you one of the 5 star characters you want. And even then, if you get the one you don‚Äôt want you need to make another 90 wishes before getting another pity. With how long it takes to grin wishes you‚Äôre pretty much required to pay money to get a character. 

The other problem is the storage. The game itself is 3.42 GB. That‚Äôs not too much for how great of a game it is. But currently, the game takes another 14 GB of space in data. I‚Äôm not even super far into the game yet but it‚Äôs still taking up almost a third of my available storage.",3
My game was hacked after spending money on the game back when it was first released and I was waiting for the next update for the next part of the story unfortunately my game got hacked and sold on the dark web I presume and it honestly sucked a lot coz I had a lot of the characters and I lost all of it. I barely started to play again and i just wish there was more protection in the account. Other than that I love the game a lot and it‚Äôs amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to get past the first part of the story again to continue the story.,5
"I think that genshin is just automatically a good game the graphics are amazing and there's overall a lot to do in the game but always when I'm playing with my friends one of us always needs something that someone else has so basically I'm saying that there should be trading you could give Mora, ascension material, talent lvl up materials, resources like flowers, and even primogems! 
It would be really helpful to not just me and my friends but others too! I'm positive that other people want it. It would be a great and hand new thing to add to the game!!",5
I gave a 5 star but the problem I have is that I just started playing this game a few days ago and I have a problem I tried to download the full package and apparently I don‚Äôt have space I deleted all the apps I didn‚Äôt need anymore and I was left with a few apps and then apparently I still didn‚Äôt have space I have no other problems but I did want to play the full game without no problems anyways this game is fun and I really appreciate it on how you made this be a game. Have a nice day :),5
I totally love this game! It was one of my first ‚ÄúGacha games‚Äù and one of the first games I was willing to spend money and time on. I‚Äôve met a lot of nice friends from co-op and the graphics are amazing! (Even on my crappy phone). There is one weird glitch I have where I‚Äôll go to teleport somewhere for a commission (mostly time challenge ones) and suddenly my language is changed to Chinese and it only turns back to normal when I log out and log back in. Other than that this game is amazing I totally recommend it & their other game Honkai impact! <3,5
"This game is amazing! I know a lot of people were mad at first because they thought that Mihoyo was copying Breath of The Wild, but personally, I think it‚Äôs far from it. The mechanics are great, and it‚Äôs easy to control. I find it super addicting and play it every chance I get. The wide variety of characters is awesome. There are so many more things I could write about in this review that a newborn would die of old age before finishing it. Long story short, great game and I am happy to say this is the most satisfying game ever to exist on mobile üëçüëçüëç",5
"Genshin impact is a great game but I have two tiny problems with it‚Ä¶The first problem is that it takes up a lot of storage in my iPhone, and the second problem is that the fives are pretty hard to get, but on the other hand it's a great game it comes out with new characters and new content like the newest version! I have been playing for a while now but I stopped for 1-2 months only because the new version was too big for my iPhone sadly.
But that's all I have today and im excited to get the new version done updating!!!",5
"I started playing during the initial release of the game because I maxed out in FFXIV and WoW. This game has been amazing to me ever since. I play it nearly everyday. There are some kinks to knock out but the events always gets me going. The story mode is pretty cool and so are the side quests. Though some people spend their time running through the gacha system, the game makes it so that you‚Äôre able to still play and enjoy the game with all of the free characters you get initially. It‚Äôs a cool game to play when you‚Äôre taking a break from other video games, like I am, and it‚Äôs a great game to play.",5
"As pretty as this area is, sheer cold is by far the worst thing to come from this game. It is so annoying and tedious. Most of my friends and I agree that if we had started in dragonspine, none of us would have ended up playing this game as much as we do. In coop it‚Äôs somehow worse, as only the first player can interact with the pylons around the map and move seelies. This means that the players have to either hug the first player or play as a pyro character to light all the fires as they go. It‚Äôs ridiculous to think that I have to either wait for the host or play as bennet if I don‚Äôt want to die from sheer cold. A great aspect of this game is that you can take your time exploring, and really soak up the atmosphere. But They threw that out the window as dragonspine. It‚Äôs a real shame that such a pretty area is so horrible to explore.",1
"When I was fighting Childe I got to the third part of it but when I died it wouldn‚Äôt let me revive so I have to start all the way over which is upsetting and I was hoping it would save my place. Another thing is how come Venti, Childe, and Zhongli not in any of the wishes, I think it‚Äôs not fair for people who‚Äôs new at the game and didn‚Äôt get a chance to get those characters, I was hoping you would be able to earn them by doing those story quest with the purple keys but you just get to try them out, I guess it makes sense since there all five star characters but it would be nice. I really love the game and will be playing it more in the future üòã",4
"The game is fun at the start when you have a bunch of chests and things collect. But once you opened everything, the only way to get more gear is by spending an oddly large portion of original resin for dungeons/ blossoms.  I‚Äôm not at that stage yet, but I can already tell since the world got really empty once I completed the Mondstadt Archon Quest. Also, certain bosses like the Oceanid has too many ‚Äúhit you no matter what you try‚Äù attacks, which is incredibly frustrating if there‚Äôs a bunch of crows keeping you in stun-lock. I hope this game gets major improvement, it‚Äôs so good, but seems too against the player sometimes.",4
"I‚Äôve played almost every mobile RPG there is and this is the first one that is indistinguishable from a console or PC game.

Genshin Impact made the smart move to avoid auto play features. I have deleted every game that uses auto play.

Also, there is no pay to play. I am enjoying the full version of the game entirely for free. I would happily pay $5 or more for this game.

I am leveling up based on game xp and not paying them. I love that they avoid micro transactions and p2p.

The controls are great as well. A bit rigid at times, but nothing that effects the game play too much.

The story and graphics are next to none. Incredible voice acting and a vast in depth story. 

It‚Äôs challenging as well. I‚Äôve died multiple times before figuring out how to fight certain bosses and it forces you to do the side quests to level up or some bosses are too much. 

If you like fantasy RPGs, this is the best mobile game you can possibly download and it‚Äôs entirely free.",5
"i loooove the story of Genshin Impact. It feels like a complete anime story. I like the assortment of characters, and they way the story makes you feel fall in love with them. 

that said, i haaaate the fighting control. the control limits my view on where i am going, and if the battle is happening near trees, it obscures the view. i guess that‚Äôs why they made healing really easy by letting the player pause and get food.

another thing that i hate is the archers controls. i try to aim, but then when i adjust the aim, i accidentally press the aim button so i lose the aim mode. this has gotten me into trouble several times especially in boss fights.

but the story is soooo good, and the graphics even at low setting is fantastic. i also love the glide mode and some small puzzles where you try to figure out what should be done in one situation, then later you find put that you did this before, ie time warp. Thank you so much for making this available as free to play!",4
"I want to give this game a better rating because it honestly seems like a good game and from other players too but for me I also kind of hate it. It‚Äôs not bad to the point I can‚Äôt do anything but it‚Äôs almost as bad. I can‚Äôt see anything except for the character and nearby surroundings so if anything attack me, I‚Äôm doomed. I preregistered for this game but I can even get the reward for that because I can access the preregistration reward from the mail, I also can access literally anything else, all I can do is walk around and climb walls. I can‚Äôt even see the animation of the game. Also, horrible horrible lags, I honestly do want to have this game a better rating because I was looking really forward to it but with things like this I just can‚Äôt.",2
"I have some problem where the world won‚Äôt render past a few feet from my character, and it really cuts down on my ability to play the game, I‚Äôm at the first encounter where your flying in the air, but I can‚Äôt see anything because my render distance just won‚Äôt load, I don‚Äôt know if this is just a mobile glitch but it definitely is a drag because there‚Äôs a lot to see, I just can‚Äôt see it without standing next to it, I‚Äôm giving five stars cause I know this game is good, I just am haven‚Äôt problems with my render distance because it doesn‚Äôt existüòì",4
"I originally had a review suggesting that we should be able to play with friends and it should have a chat system in game but once I got to a certain level all of that stuff is actually there. -facepalm-
I change from 4 to 5 stars since all those features are available. 
HOWEVER I would still like to see the ability to chat in a server chat and direct message to your friends without being in their world. 
Currently I am seeking help to kill 6 of these fatui elemental guys and the only way I can ask is by setting a signature and hoping someone reads it. Or wait for my friend to wake up and message her on discord but that‚Äôs a lot. 

Anyway this game is still a 5 star game. Very impressive for mobile.

Side note: I think the people experiencing issues are likely using older devices. That‚Äôs usually the case so I wouldn‚Äôt pay them too much mind if you have the iPhone X or newer you won‚Äôt have an issue.",5
So I do love This game It‚Äôs quite Entertaining The only problem i have is That when i redowloaded it It tell me to login or to update it and when i go to update it it tells me there‚Äôs not enough storage on my device even though i have plenty But when i reopen the app i decided to just login But it doesn‚Äôt want to give me the option again Which is Annoying and also A bummer But if you could please get that fixed i‚Äôll add the fifth star Other than what i just mentioned It‚Äôs a very fun game and i highly recommend it Thanks and have a great Day/Night ü§óü§ó‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíú,4
"Now, I‚Äôm usually not a fan of gacha games. Usually you eventually have to pay money to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù but so far, that isn‚Äôt the case with this. If you play the game, you unlock wishes which are used to wish for a character. Maybe you‚Äôll find it, maybe not. But at least it‚Äôs not locked behind a paywall. The gameplay is very fluid and I‚Äôve had very little problems with it too! While there‚Äôs some farming you have to do now and there, it‚Äôs not to bad either.
With that said, 12 or so hours in, this is shaping to be a fantastic experience",5
Great game beautiful art and scenery. But they don‚Äôt treat the players respectfully and you feel it while playing and you can tell that the developers only real goal is money which draws away from the beauty of the game. The rewards for the anniversary and in general are very disappointing. Every action they take seems like they are trying to leach money out of the players. The game would be a lot better if money wasn‚Äôt always the #1 priority. Also better floor 12 rewards or something as there is no point to late game. It is also 20gb on my phone.,4
"I‚Äôve waited around 6 months for Dehya and have been saving and also spending money in order to get her and what did I receive in return? An unfinished, buggy character with a barley useable kit. Her burst cancels when you jump, and if you‚Äôre frozen and your on mobile have fun!! Her scalings are lower than a 4 stars and she‚Äôs a 5-star. And when you use your burst and move into an immovable object your burst cancels. And now she‚Äôs just on the standard banner because you guys are too lazy to improve her kit? Never have I ever seen a character with such a disastrous kit this feels so awful I just want to be able to play one of my favorite characters and enjoy the game but no I guess not thanks for not rewarding your players with the satisfaction of a good character.",1
I think its about time that mihoyo works on balancing some characters. There are characters that don‚Äôt perform well and its because this company refuses to revisit old characters. It makes it inevitable that characters will get power crept and fall off as the game goes on. Not to mention how they released multiple unfinished characters. There is a good chance that any character you want will be shafted because they never release them as finished products. You shouldn't have to wait 11 patches later for a character to finally be good??? Either take more time creating your units cause obviously y'all cant work fast and make a good product or actually listen to the community when they say hey this character doesn't work and fix it.,1
"The game is beautiful and it could be a lot of fun to continue playing. However, the customer service is abysmal and they refuse to provide actual customer service. If you pay for anything in-game and you don‚Äôt receive the product or service, then oh well- they will spend weeks acting like they don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to explain to them. You‚Äôll lose money, time, and patience. They talk to you like you‚Äôre ignorant no matter how many screenshots or messages you send, covering everything they have asked you too. It is truly disheartening. The lack of customer service and a company that doesn‚Äôt care, make this game unworthy of your time, effort, and money.",2
"I started playing shortly after the game released and absolutely love it. The scenery is gorgeous, the characters compelling, the storylines interesting, and the events well-designed (and fun!). I can play a little each day and don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting left behind, and I can spend days playing way too much and not run out of content (for long, anyway).  Just when I think I‚Äôve done everything there is to do, a new update comes with exciting new characters, stories, and events. Definitely worth playing!",5
"as much as people like to nitpick this is actually so amazing considering it is a free mobile game. You could even debate that it is the most impressive FREE MOBILE game out there!! I mean seriously who else makes such beautiful open worlds better and more accessible? Im pretty sure nobody. 

since feedback is always nice to grow though i would really like if windtrace was all year round and if quests gave slightly more primos. Theres nothing more unsatisfying than doing a quest for an hour only to not even get more than 1 wish at best :/",5
"After the announcement of no end game because it ‚Äúwill heighten anxiety with players.‚Äù The game has lost a lot of its players due to said ‚Äúanxiety.‚Äù Because the pills and characters they‚Äôve gotten will go to waste doing repetitive events and the bi weekly spiral grind.

The thing keeping me to the game is the possibility of raids and raid bosses being a thing, so I made investments with that in mind. Getting the best healing characters and decent tanks. Tower of fantasy seems to be pulling ahead in the longevity category.

Now this could all change when they retract that statement and surprise us. But as of now, the end game is boring. And the story is good enough to scrape on by.",3
"Hey genshin, I love the game, I really do. Keep up the good work! 
Now on to the request;
So, I know you just came out with a new update.. I can‚Äôt update Genshin because it requires too much storage. I‚Äôve deleted every thing that I possibly can, but still can‚Äôt update it. 
Can you maybe make the updates require not as much storage? I believe it would help some people who would love to play this game. If your reading this then I hope you think about this. Thank you.

"When ever i joined for the first time i wasn‚Äôt able to play, but the second time worked but i had exit and rejoin over and over again but i finally got through the cutscene it played it normal i really in joyed the first few moments, but when i got to the village it said i HAVE to download the new updated version, and so I‚Äôve been downloading and deleting the game ever since then, it‚Äôs probably because i play on an iPad but i really want to play it and yet it still doesn‚Äôt work, it still says that i have to download the new version. I hope you fix this bug so i can play, I‚Äôll give 5 stars if so. Have a good day ü•∞",3
"My experience with Genshin was really to know what are people in class into these days but, when I started playing it got really addicting I deleted EVERYTHING in my iPad for the new update but it seems like it‚Äôs not working out. However the characters are so cute and each have their own story. I‚Äôm just new to this game, but, I still have goals to accomplish like *getting a 5 star character *. I think this game is really fun and worth all the storage and effort your sacrificing.",5
So I haven‚Äôt played the game since before the first expansion to the map came out. I dropped it for personal reasons but I decided to pick it up again since I have time to kill. I have tried downloading the update a number of times but the App Store keeps saying to update it. I have trouble doing the in game update because it says there‚Äôs not enough space even though my phone still has half its storage left. I was able to log in and play using my Apple account but that‚Äôs restating from the beginning and I don‚Äôt want to do that. I keep trying to login using my personal account but it just keeps saying verifying then stops nothing happens and I have to press login again for it to do the same thing.,1
I love genshin I‚Äôve been playing since 1.3 it‚Äôs fun and i love the story. However with the new content coming out it seems to be harder for new players as the new events are based off of how far you are in the game. So if you‚Äôre AR 25 and below or just a casual player then you won‚Äôt qualify to take part in new events. Also because certain items are region blocked if a new player gets a new character they have to speedrun the whole game just to get to the said region in order to upgrade a character and that just takes the fun out of the game and makes people stop playing.,4
"I don‚Äôt know why but whenever I try to join Genshin Impact, it would say insufficient storage. I deleted so many apps and pictures and it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I of course had apps that I couldn‚Äôt delete due to their importance to me. If the developer reads this review, please tell me if this is a bug or if I need to have only Genshin Impact on my IOS. If this is a bug I really need it fixed. 
Thank you for your time. (It‚Äôs only rated 5 starts so that the developer reads it, and because a friend of mine plays and loves it.)",5
"This game has been really fun and great, but again I feel genshin is missing something? Maybe make it more fun and seem worth it. The rewards are a little crappy and eh. The quests are fine but sometimes it‚Äôs hard to do certain things. I also think you should add another character! One that‚Äôs a bit similar to Albedo but different! She‚Äôs an adult and works with geo. An artist with tattoos and whatnot, maybe something like that? And dark skinned too! Please? I love the work but try adding more excitement and better rewards.",5
"Genshin is a great game I love it. I made a mistake tho. I tried to switch email accounts because I used one that just automatically filled in and not my personal one. And I‚Äôve been playing for a couple months now and made a lot of progress and had a decent amount of characters although I never had luck wishing. But anyway I tried to switch account but as soon as I tried it reset my entire game. And idk what to do, and I‚Äôm scared to finish the begging cut scene because I don‚Äôt know what to do. And I really don‚Äôt want to lose the progress that I‚Äôve made. Mihoyo please help!",4
"This game is basically everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a game: An open world where I can fight monsters and do quest while playing fun characters. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs also a lot more games like that out there but I don‚Äôt think they can come close to the same quality as Genshin Impact. I find everything in this game to be absolutely gorgeous and it‚Äôs going to be hard to find other games that can top this one. This is a truly wonderful game and has changed my life a lot, thank you.",5
At first I didn‚Äôt really think much of it but the The first time I saw this game was on TikTok and then I downloaded it for fun the next thing you know I start to get addicted to it and it became my number one favorite game. I quit other games just to play this game and played other games under mihoyo. But just so you know even being a mobile player comes with consequences like your battery compatibility going down.  If you‚Äôre mobile player playing on iPhone I check your battery compatibility just in case.,5
Hi about in may 2021 I got genshin impact it looked like such a cool fun game at first I didn‚Äôt understand ANYTHING but after about a week or two I figured everything out it‚Äôs a bit confusing when you first start but watch some other people play it and you‚Äôll know what to do anyway I totally recommend this game it‚Äôs super fun super cute and there are a lot of defrent characters to collect and there‚Äôs also multiplayer later in the game genshin impact is also a really friendly community so definitely consider getting this app!,5
"Hey Genshin, I know you work hard to make us smile. but I just want to say something. Thanks for giving me the 5 star I wanted, thanks for doing everything you done for us. I‚Äôm so sorry about people not liking the game on TikTok. Your also taking on to much on us, take a break. People need to Learn there lesson to be greatfull for y‚Äôall. I hope u always get lucky, Don‚Äôt have a good day! Have an amazing day! Thanks for being nice to us :) also don‚Äôt give up yet, you might want to still keep doing it.:)",5
"I will admit, when my friends first got me into it, I didn‚Äôt like it at first. But after Learned more about it and went on quests I have been having a lot of fun! This game is visually stunning, with great character designs and graphics! It is a bit harder though when you don‚Äôt spend money, but I have been doing all right as a free to play player! For parents, this game does have some violence, but there is no gore throughout the game. It‚Äôs the perfect game for tweens and up! I totally recommend this game!",5
"First of all, the graphics are literally so amazing, this is probably the best game I‚Äôve had on my phone, I‚Äôm addicted, seriously, I wouldn‚Äôt delete this game for the world, its really fun, even when I don‚Äôt have any resin theres still stuff to do, I love playing with my friends in this game and I love all the character designs, they‚Äôre actually creative tbh, especially kokomi, I love her design a lot and the colors, good job mihoyo, (I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs actually how you say it) but thank you for making this game, I haven‚Äôt had this much fun in forever",5
"I love this game and have been playing it since 2020. The only thing i‚Äôm kinda sad about is that if you wanna buy genesis crystals it‚Äôs not a good deal, especially because i can‚Äôt waste hundreds on it . Also my luck is trash. I wanted to get Targalia and got qiqi, i mean she is pretty good but not enough to waste you pity. My sisters account is an envy to every ftp account account. She got two five stars in 5 ten pulls and she is not even half way to soft pity LIEK GURL WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET THAT LUCK . Any ways i love the game.  My most favorite thing to do besides getting boba üßã lol.",5
"The game it self is great and wholesome . nice combat system cool characters and amazing story , breath taking scenery and map ‚Ä¶.etc but as a players we kinda need to feel appreciated for our support since it‚Äôs the game 1 year anniversary some people like myself who love this game and considers it their favorite game it feels like an overly underwhelming anniversary especially with the rewards so mihoyo needs to address that. So they don‚Äôt end up losing the support they have from the people who loves the game with that being said I will continue to play the game and support in any way I can but it‚Äôs nice to feel rewarded for that.",4
"For a month playing this game I am impressed by the graphics Mihoyo has come up with even the styles of clothing, they‚Äôre amazing. No wonder people love this since I was a bit curious in a way when a friend on mine introduced me this game but I never tried it till a month ago. Now I know why she‚Äôs hooked to it every time we hangout ü§£ I am the same. Great work developers! Please continue to make people smile & have fun since reality isn‚Äôt much on good terms as time goes by. We all need to smile and have fun once in a while.",5
"I love this game so much. It pains me to leave a review so negative, but this morning I woke up with my account completely gone. I never shared my password or did anything warranting my account being removed, but here I am. I pray that this is a horrible glitch but for now everything I have tried failed and I don‚Äôt even know how to contact mihoyo to help me get my account back. Truly devastating and sad. If anyone has tips I would appreciate it greatly. I‚Äôve spent over a hundred dollars on this game and countless hours, all lost.",5
"From my experience, it feels like a 5/5 perfect game when there is meaningful content to do.

Disregard what people say about the Gacha rates. Having played multiple other Gacha games, I have to say this game has the best f2p Gacha compared to others. Getting a character feels special and a big step for progression.

However, every so often you‚Äôll find yourself stuck in little or nothing to do. It‚Äôs at time like these that the game feels like a 3/5 experience. And it just so happened that the Anniversary date of the game was in one of those periods, which led the game to getting lots of negative reviews.

The game is still amazing and a breathtaking experience.

Ps.: if you have a busy life you can disregard the content drought entirely. The game was made for 15m-1h30m playtimes depending on your dedication. So it‚Äôs perfect to play after a long day of Work or University to relax and talk to friends with.",5
"This is me trying to help with the current situation. It has come to my attention that people are starting to get angry with the anniversary rewards for some reason. Of course, most of them are regarding the primogems. I don‚Äôt really care about primogems, some people might, but I don‚Äôt. I love the adventure and the characters. We get the luxury of having RERUNS for goodness sake. If you didn‚Äôt get someone you wanted last time, save up, buy primogems, but don‚Äôt bash them about not getting enough. That‚Äôs all :). 

TLDR: Don‚Äôt complain about primogems, save up or buy it >:)
Bye bye <3",5
"This game has amazing graphics, gameplay, character designs, storyline, good mechanis, and last good VA's. For some of us first day player yes it's a little smaller than other events I have heard people say we didn't get anything for the top game of the year we did they gave out many promos and the community just keeps wanting more and more but if you haven't played since 1.1 or the early stages of the game development than we should have no complaints we get primos every day for just playing and the events",5
The game is fantastic and really it‚Äôs a ton of fun. There is a lot to do and they continue adding content and events consistently. Even when there‚Äôs no new events and you‚Äôre all caught up all you have to do is login for about 20 min for the dailies and move on with your day! Only bad part about this game is the community cuz most of them are toxic are ungrateful. Don‚Äôt let the low rates trick you cuz they‚Äôre probably just players mad about anniversary rewards when they are not that bad. The game is great and definitely worth giving a try!,5
"Yes the game is absolutely amazing I enjoy it but the 2 things that worry's me is storage and logging out - logging out make you not get the account back and restart from the beginning and it will get deleted - storage is 4 GB and the game tells you if you wanna get 6 GB That makes 10 GB with all of them combined I would like if you could remove that because it might trigger some viruses that happen to me on my phone so I would like you to remove that / that's all the problems I hope you understand.

Love - mai",5
"I‚Äôve played countless games, gacha games always have anniversaries not to mention non gacha games as well like CoD Mobile. It‚Äôs a way to give back to the people who have been supporting the game. Genshin did nothing, and they had the audacity to put ‚Äú1st anniversary‚Äù logo on their icon, on their website. Umm.. what anniversary? They have made billions of dollars, becoming one of the top grossing games period. This is what we get for supporting them? This is a spit in the face to the players. You claim 1 year is a milestone for you guys, while spitting in the face of the players. All these outside greedy advertising while you do nothing for the actual players who play the game. They have only encouraged us to spend more money and advertise their game while doing nothing for us. Money-hungry, cheap and greedy.",1
"The game overall is amazing, graphics are great characters are great, but then there‚Äôs level 25-26 it‚Äôs an absolute nightmare, for me spending almost a day grinding just fighting bosses non-stop it‚Äôs really time consuming and difficult for level 25, bosses almost 2 times as stronger as you very difficult, in my opinion you shouldn‚Äôt have to fight tons of bosses just to get to a different level it‚Äôs just stupid I get why you do that but no please it‚Äôs too difficult for beginners like me as other people, so im not asking you to get rid of it im just asking to make the 1st ascension not so difficult. üëçüèªüòÅ",4
Hello yes i enjoy the game but the reason i am writing it as 3 stars is because when you switch servers it will not save your progress which is really annoying meaning if you and a friend chose the wrong server in the beginning then you cant play together without having one or the other restart which is really really annoying so if you could please fix that you could possibly choose whether you want to save over progress or not then that would be very much appreciated and if you can do this then thank you this is the only reason if 3 stars and not 4 or 5 stars so if you fix this that would help a lot thank you.,3
"You could completely ignore the Gacha elements of this game and just play it as a breath of the wild clone and you would probably be very surprised at how high-quality the adventuring, combat, graphics, and story/voice acting is of this free game. 

If you choose to engage with the paid elements (battle passes, buying wishes, etc) obviously be careful but this game is more transparent and less obnoxious about throwing those mechanics in your face compared to others in the genre. With enough time, you can complete almost everything without spending. 

Runs shockingly smooth on my iPhone 10S however there is substantial frame dips on my wife‚Äôs phone. YMMV.",4
"Game is beautiful and well made. In the beginning they get you hooked by making things seem easy and giving you lots of free stuff. Mid-late game is where they get ya. The momentum runs out, things get much harder, and you want to be as successful as you once were. There are almost no free resources in the late game. The quests and achievements stop. You have to pay to continue and they always seem to make the goal just out of reach. You‚Äôll never have that perfect team. You‚Äôll never even be able to play the characters you want. Save yourself the time and money and move on. This is just another gambling game and the house always wins. They make millions a month and they won‚Äôt even give away a single free character once you‚Äôre hooked.",1
I usually don‚Äôt like spending money on games and this games does have transactions so when I was going into this I thought That it was going to be hard to get good things but they way the game is designed is that artifacts is what makes a character really good and there are a lot of ways to get resin when you are a F2P Therefore the people that pay for genesis crystals aren‚Äôt going to have much of a advantage. So if you are worried that in order to be good in the game you need to pay money you have no more need too,5
"I can‚Äôt even tell you the kind of masterpiece this game is because you have to play to know. You know how you hardly leave reviews but then you discover something THAT NEEDS TO GET MORE RECOGNITION? Well Genshin impact is definitely that for me. From the animation to the storyline and the different characters and materials and towns and people, everything is perfect. As soon as I wake up the first thing I click on is this app because it‚Äôs just too beautiful and addictive. If you‚Äôre not playing Genshin, what are you doing with your life seriously ?",5
You should create a open world mmorpg mobile with similar features. But this time make it where you loot on kill and stuff also the servers should‚Äôve opened you know. It shouldn‚Äôt be you got to invite people to your server. I know it‚Äôs like a story game we‚Äôre everyone is the same character. But you should do something like kurtpel is and anime open world game that is fully online but if possible make it mobile that would be a hit game. I know it can‚Äôt be exactly like a pc game but I think it would be the first one in a anime open world online game,5
"My friend recommended this game to me, so naturally I decided to try it out. I was really hyped up to get in and play it, and the loading screen was beautiful, but.... nothing. The bridge loading thing just kept going on and on, and as a very impatient person, this really annoyed me. I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug or not, because my friend said their game loads in 30 seconds or less, but I sometimes wait for over 20 minutes (still nothing after all that waiting ). Another thing is that I don‚Äôt have a Game Center account, but I really want to play this game with my friend. Is there a way to play the game without an account?? And if the loading screen is a bug, could you please please please fix it??",2
"Dear *explicitly deleted* this is the most beautiful app game I have ever seen or played in my whole life! I‚Äôm not being paid, I am not being asked to write this by anyone, I am not in a basement somewhere being held hostage. This is literally all me saying WOW I can‚Äôt believe how amazing this game is. 
I have literally been addicted to this game since I downloaded it and I erased any other games I had on my phone üòÇ 
If you like open world, fantasy/magic/medieval, rpg, story driven games that are so beautiful to look at, you need to play this game!
I am Rae Serbeck and I approve of this message!",5
"I‚Äôm actually a Game Art major and after pouring hours into this game I‚Äôm addicted. Though a lot of the core mechanics are ripped off from Breath of the Wild, don‚Äôt let that fool you from the amazing gameplay, storyline, characters and missions. There‚Äôs literally always something to do in game that takes my breath away and I get excited over playing almost every day. Not to mention a game this size and quality is FREE TO PLAY! Sure, it has loot boxes and wish rolling, but you do not have to spend money to advance in the storyline nor spend months grinding to get the same advantage.",5
"Genish Impact is a really fun game, but the reason why i gave it a 4 stars instead of a 5 stars is because I can't login into any other device. I recently linked my socials but it still doesn't work. When ever I try to login, it says account error, which is a big problem. Another thing is it sometimes crashed while I'm doing a quest, meaning I have to start all over. I think thats all but please fix the login account error thing, I'm getting anxious that one day my device that I play on will get kicked out and I can never login back into that account full of progress.",4
"This game is good in all, but I played Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild 2 years ago and the story, mechanics, and graphic are almost completely the same. For example, the gilder you get at the beginning is of the game works the exact same way the Zelda one does, the stamina bar, the climbing, and the evade mechanic are exactly the same as Zelda, and the four temples of air or whatever are like the shrines in Zelda. I mean, they literally glow blue when you use them and if that doesn‚Äôt wring a bell then i don‚Äôt know what does. Again, this game is cool, and I haven‚Äôt even finished it so maybe I‚Äôm being crazy, but it‚Äôs a close game to Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wilds. Thank you for reading.",4
"This game is beautiful, and I was having fun playing it and happily investing money into it...until they released Zhongli.  Zhongli was advertised as a shield builder that could also dish out ‚Äúenormous damage‚Äù according to one of their trailers.  Sounded fun to me, so I spent money and got the character (pity, of course).  After many people tested out the character it was found that his damage dealing was lacking, and people complained en mass.  Mihoyo then released a statement that the character was intended to be a tank.  I felt cheated out of my money and will not spend anymore on this game.  Also, be careful of your account, the games security is very poor, despite the company making record profits, they have not acknowledged this problem, and have not released a statement about plans to upgrade.  Such mismanagement of a potentially great game.  Stay away!",1
"This game is a great open world game with strategy, action, fighting, exploration, stories and so much more! I love the combat and I think and think that they did a wonderful job with the art. I only have 2 problems. 1)Traveling is hard, it is good to explore but you can hardly ever just get where you want easily, even with teleporting. 2)It keeps kicking me out. I think this is common for some people on this game but is very frustrating, please fix it! Other than that it is an awesome game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

PS. If your reading this still, just download it, it is soooo worth it",4
i absolutely love this game it has good graphics good music lots of characters that help with battle strategies and well it‚Äôs just overall an amazing game but we need more end game content because i may not be end game but most of my friends are and they tell me how there just isn‚Äôt really much to do when you finish all the awesome and fun packed quests and explore all of the cool places to go we just really need more end game content for the people who have been playing enough to get all these fun things done,5
Honestly its been almost a month and you still haven‚Äôt fixed the rendering bug with ipads like bruh i‚Äôve been itching to play this game since it came out but because of that bug i could not play at all imagine you spent most of your memory to download a game you couldn‚Äôt even play because of a rendering bug?and you don‚Äôt wanna get rid of it because of the ridicolous time it took to download all the assests if you would fix that tiny problem your player base would probably go up by 20% more if you fix the tremendous fps loss for mid tier phones that would increase your players by 30% more please its been almost a month please please please fix the rendering bug we beg of you,3
"I love this game. It‚Äôs beautiful and the gameplay is amazing, kind of like BOTW. I would love to praise this game more for its quality and story, but let‚Äôs face the facts.

Less than a day after installing the full version, I found that this game had already taken 6.8 GIGABYTES OF MY STORAGE. The game doesn‚Äôt run as smoothly as I‚Äôd like and it makes my phone overheat. Thankfully, these problems are minor and easily fixable, but I can‚Äôt erase the fact that this game, in less than 24 hours, took up more storage than 4 years worth of photos.

It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I enjoy this game, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if your current phone isn‚Äôt in peak condition.",3
"I‚Äôm sure the review will be blocked like always. But I can‚Äôt believe the released Dehya in the state she‚Äôs in, she‚Äôs barely even playable. She‚Äôs basically a worse Albedo in every way. Her skill‚Äôs pyro application is too slow, and doesn‚Äôt have enough uptime. She can‚Äôt even burgeon well cuz of the slow application, and the burgeons don‚Äôt hit tall enemies. The burst you can‚Äôt even control, it just goes on autopilot, and is buggy cuz getting stuck on a rock or box cancels it, and can‚Äôt even hit bosses. The burst also repositions the skill, but doesn‚Äôt refresh it like Kokomi. Her tanking mechanic is worse than weak shields and isn‚Äôt active enough. As a 5 star, she generally performs worse than 4 stars with similar abilities and does less damage than even support 4 stars.",1
"Amazing game and everything at the beginning but stuff like daily commissions get a bit repetitive and the thing I love second to most about this game is that I have seen less than five bugs throughout my five-month playthrough, although I would agree with other players that we need a little bit more customization for things such as character hairstyles maybe, weapons, etc. If you hate this game, my brain cannot tell y‚Äôall in English words how much it will never be friends with you.",5
"Easy free to play without having to pay honestly!! Quests are fun to play and fun to solve! Storyline and lore is amazing and honestly enjoying every bit of it :) Daily quests are quick and easy to complete, and easy for those who have relatively busy schedules. With the new content, I hope they do improve on a bit more rewards system with the game in general. The graphics in this game is great and honestly dont need a nintendo switch to enjoy like Breath of the Wild (lol) Lore, character interaction, side quests, daily comissions, great to play!!",5
"This game has an expensive words, tones of amazing characters, and a great story. I took off one star just for the fact that if you are susceptible to luck based content that in app purchases would increase your chances for, then you may not want this game. However, this a NOT a pay to win game. They give you plenty of opportunities to get new characters and all the materials you need. Their are only a few outfits and weapons that are behind a paywall, but those are not necessary in the slightest. I loved Breath of the Wild, and I count this game as equal in my enjoyment and is a similar play style.",4
"I‚Äôve never experienced a more gorgeous game. The graphics are incredible, the storyline is touching, the characters‚Äô stories go deep‚Ä¶ this game has everything you want. I‚Äôm a big Skyrim and BotW/Zelda guy but this game runs circles around those. I‚Äôm constantly impressed. 

I do wish I didn‚Äôt have to spend quiteeeeee so much money whenever I hope to upgrade a character, but that‚Äôs literally the way this game was made so I won‚Äôt fault it. It‚Äôs an incredible business model, used by Fortnite and other free to play games.",5
"This is an amazing game, but one thing I would like to add is the event map, you can find conches to get Fischl‚Äôs new skin, I believe it‚Äôs just me who‚Äôs missing a conch on the map, I looked everywhere and even had to look up places on where to find the conches, but it seems I‚Äôm actually missing one, the conch I‚Äôm missing is on Minacious Isle, it was the conch that you had to climb the tree roots and get to the top, then climb the ladder, and go to the rocks and then you‚Äôll see a conch, but I‚Äôm missing that conch.  If you‚Äôd please fix this I‚Äôd be so grateful, thank you!",5
"now genshin impact is an amazing game just thte only thing is i can barley play it, to download the game its lots of storage and when it all loads, the door appears. u wanna go through the door and then it give u to options, to download the full version, or to remind me later. if u press download full version u might get u dont have enough storage, or it will let u wait until it all loads and u can play, and the remind me later button just puts u back at welcome, i got a little annoyed when i pressed remind me later bc it didnt let me in the game. when i pressed load full version it said my storage was full! like how can i download a game perfectly fine then right after i wanna download the full version if there is it just says ‚Äúno storage available‚Äù like what i dont get it. the game is amazing just its so much storage! and that prevents me from being able to play.",5
"this game is good obviously, but theyre treating sumeru like one sick joke. obviously its a fictional game, but each area is based off of the actual earth. its no secret that sumeru was suppost to be in parallels with south asia/middle eastern area. still having a couple white characters is fine, since not all natives are dark, but the entire cast is pale white except for a FOUR STAR that is ‚Äúlightly tanned‚Äù. the archon especially shouldn‚Äôt be white, and the game creators/developers know that. even the dori girl that was leaked, not only is she extremely white (lighter than diona) but she is a stereotype against south asians (her leaked idles revealing that she is a ‚Äúscammer‚Äù type character) and has an orientalist design. this company is big enough to push back the release of sumeru and at LEAST fix some of the characters skin tones.",1
"Genshin Impact was a game I downloaded about a few months ago, and ever since has been never ending fun! With all the quests, regions, and characters to hang out with it all comes together to create the beautiful world of Teyvat. Now I will admit genshin has had its faults in the past, and should really give better endgame, but if you play casually you should be able to enjoy the game as intended instead of playing 24/7 and running out of content. Play the events, save for characters you like, and go at your own pace. Good luck!",5
"I have played this game for over a year and I‚Äôm still not bored of it, very fun and great story quests and characters, however what the heck mihoyo. With the new region coming out, Sumeru (based on culture from the middle east) I simply cannot stress enough that they are whitewashing the characters to the point that they are whiter than some of the actual Europeans in this game (from Mondstadt). Adding on to this, one of the new characters leaked (by reliable sources) Dori, has a stereotypical genie theme, being as she is one of the first characters coming from Sumeru, Mihoyo really glanced at the middle east and thought, ‚Äúgenie.‚Äù Not to mention she‚Äôs whiter than snow. The representation of middle eastern countries and culture needs to be FIXED. Please do more research.",2
"As we all know each of the regions are based off different places in real life. Sumeru specifically is based off of Southern Asia and the Middle East both of these areas have people with more darker skin colors. So it would only make sense for characters from Sumeru to have darker skin colors. Yet, based off the information we have (leaks, npcs, the comics etc.) the characters from Sumeru are pale. I‚Äôm honestly so disappointed in this game. The amount of research and detail put into places like Inazuma and Japan and Liyue and China only for Sumeru to be completely stereotyped and inaccurate. Of course when it comes to creating fantasy nations it doesn‚Äôt need to be 100% accurate but when its something as big as inaccurate Skin colors it becomes a problem.",1
"Great game for the most part but I‚Äôll come back when I‚Äôm able to pull for a character and grind for their constellations instead spreading hundreds of dollars only to get 2-3 copies of that character. Should‚Äôve just kept the rates where they were at honestly. Same for the weapon banner, I shouldn‚Äôt need to spend a 1,000 more dollars for 1 weapon to be maxed out. And for people that can‚Äôt spend hella money, they‚Äôll never be able to play their 5* characters at their full potential which I find unfair if we‚Äôre comparing this game to other popular titles. Hoyoverse is to greedy and inconsiderate of its f2p players.   But that‚Äôs just my opinion.",3
Normally I don‚Äôt really like games like these as they are quite boring and not very fun to play. I saw this and downloaded it to see if maybe it would be worth it and it definitely surprised me. The vast selection of almost everything is really well mapped out. The games not too hard but not too easy to play and it‚Äôs overall very fun to play. There‚Äôs a great story line with amazing side quests and it‚Äôs so fun to discover new things. This is the best game I‚Äôve found 100% it‚Äôs easy to understand and it‚Äôs very worth the time spent on it.,5
"To be honest these developers have probably took a long time to make this so let‚Äôs support them for making a good game! Also, the graphics and combat in this game are beyond exquisite. I hope you continue to make good games just like Genshin Impact. We will support you along the way too. Just tell us when you need it. The characters, skills design, and effects are very great. Remember that you‚Äôre great like everyone else is. I hope you continue to make great games like this exquisite game. Have an amazing day! Bye! :)",5
"I love genshin impact, it‚Äôs only been a day and i already love it! The stories and background are all so good, and so are all the little scenes. I love the trial feature as well as the gliders! Also the work put into all the areas of genshin impact, especially monstadt. Although on mobile devices (mostly ipads and tablets) it can get very annoying to constantly get kicked out. also whenever you exit the app and not close it, it doesn‚Äôt save the story your in and can start it from the beginning of the quest/story and that can get quite annoying. other then that this game is the best!",4
This game is the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. It has literally ruined my life but it‚Äôs also my only hobby. Don‚Äôt ever wish on the weapon banner. It is Never worth it. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible to get the weapon you want before max fate points. The game reads your mind and it knows. It knows which standard five star you want the least and every time you lose the 50/50 it will always be that five star. I‚Äôve been playing this game since the day it released and I can genuinely say I would be so much happier if i never even knew it existed. My self worth has become inextricably linked to my primogem balance. I am nothing.,3
"The game has the same style and so as it has the same map fetuses, ‚Äúteleport‚Äù feature,monkey like people in masks with a red eye on the white mask attack you just like the people in the same mask that are known as your enemy, but what I found out is that they have the same bases as the goblins from breath of the wild. I love the character design and the way how you can tell they inspired the game off Zelda but I love how they changed it up a bit also. Amazing game. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Zelda, lore, and combat!",5
"I can‚Äôt with Genshin ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôve been playing since release and I can‚Äôt with this game. It‚Äôs amazing, and I‚Äôm practically addicted to it. It‚Äôs an interesting storyline, has beautiful characters, and the graphics are spot on.  But before getting this game, make sure you are willing to give up 
15 GB of storage for this game. And, it can be super laggy on old devices, take it from me. The game can be kinda complicated, but you will quickly understand after digging through research, watching gameplays/gacha, etc. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do üòª",5
"Alright. I‚Äôll say what everyone is. This company is one of the greediest, stingiest companies ever. However, they know full well how to make a fun, adventurous game with a fun gacha system. However, they could spare a few primogems every now and then. Also, a reset hero option would be delightful. I‚Äôve noticed it in many other games with a gacha system and it makes them a lot easier. I hate to compare, but games like Idle Heroes, AFK Arena, and Cookie Run are all generous when it comes to their rolling materials. A little more generosity would make this game extremely fun. 

Tldr: greedy but fun game, add reset hero option",4
This is a great game beautiful worlds and great quests. But one thing is that I delete genshin by accident and I downloaded it again and I did the password. and it was correct and then it saids not enough storage. I deleted some of my apps and offloaded some of the apps and it still says not enough storage. And then I searched what can I do if i don‚Äôt have enough storage space for genshin and I read all of it then I did what it said. I deleted it and then install it again. And like I said I deleted some stuff and offload some apps didint work.,5
"Genshin impact is awesome, the art, animation, scenery, everything. It has its few problems, like the anniversary prizes could be better. But that‚Äôs pretty much the only problem. I‚Äôd highly recommend for you to play it. It‚Äôs free, with only you having to buy stuff in game, which is only these crystals called Genisis Crystals, and they are used to get primogems. Primogems can be used for wishing to get new characters. Genshin impact includes fun adventures, emergency food who is named paimon, and lots of other fun things! ;) have fun with the game if you downloaded.",5
"I have been playing Genshin impact for a long time, and I haven‚Äôt really experienced any bugs, this game has nice graphics gotta say, the character designs are very unique in a different way. 
Mihoyo can you add like a gifting primogems system? Because I have low primos and my family wants to give me some but they can‚Äôt, so sadly I had to stick with low primogems.
Thank you for reading! I know it‚Äôs short- but I tried my best because I didn‚Äôt have a lot of ideas on this game to add, it‚Äôs pretty well already, not much to add or stuff. 

:)",5
"I‚Äôm blown away, the art is gorgeous, it reminds me of a mix of kingdom hearts and breath of the wild, mixed with elements of an anime called ‚Äúerased‚Äù. The music is gorgeous and i play this nonstop. The only thing I wish there was. Was a easier ability to heal yourself without having to travel to a idol, or eat food. Also, more opportunities to earn in game currencies or at least some way to not rely on currency to evolve your player. 

Fantastic game. I‚Äôm looking forward to updates and changes in the future. You have earned yourself a lifelong fan.",5
"Hello, I am a player for genshin impact. I like this game a lot and is very happy that the game is free even though I got no legendary. But I would like ask a question if you guys are trying to put many different cultures into your game. Your new map seems to be based off of Japan. It would be cool if you guys did Korea since it has many beautiful places to. But if not I would like a map based off of the Greece/ Roman time period. (This is only a recommendation based on my opinion). I hope you guys read this comment! If you guys reply to this and answer my question I would appreciate it.",4
"Mihoyo, thank you for creating this game. it‚Äôs really entertaining and fun to play. working hard to get characters, quests and much more! the anniversary rewards are also very nice! When i first started playing the first thing i said was ‚Äúwow! such nice graphics‚Äù and i was right. the graphics are also amazing. the character designs are also very pretty. this game has made changes in my life. also, when i was adventure rank 1 i didn‚Äôt know what a gnosis was‚Ä¶now i‚Äôm adventure rank 50 and i still don‚Äôt üòÇ thank you, again!",5
"Words cannot describe my love for this game. At first, I was unsure about it but once I started playing and leveling up, I couldn‚Äôt stop. I have easily spent 8+ hours in one day playing this game. I love rpgs with a great story, and Genshin gives just that. The fighting mechanics are very easy to learn too. Ok mobile it‚Äôs just a button and on pc, simply press your mouse. This game has also brought my friends closer together, since we help each other explore the world map and fight bosses together. Overall, 5/5 game. Highly recommend.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since zhongli‚Äôs banner. (If you haven‚Äôt ever played he‚Äôs a 5-star in game). All that to say I wish I had played sooner! The animation is great and already I‚Äôve seen improvements in character design and cut scene animation in just a few months! I would really love too see this game available on a Nintendo switch as my iPad and iPhone are going to be overloaded in future updates, but so far I have no major complaints over the game. It is highly addictive and entertaining but I encourage everyone to give it a try.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for half a year, maybe more and I love it. I will say though, saving up primogens is annoying, and getting characters is completely luck based. You also don‚Äôt know when there will be reruns of banners for certain 5 star characters. It‚Äôs buggy sometimes, but most of the time the game runs great. I have a lot of fun with my friends on there. The graphics are beautiful as well. I do wish some characters looked liked their comic counterparts a bit more, but that‚Äôs just a personal preference. Each character still looks great. 
I highly recommend this game",4
"This game is super fun however it crashes more often now on mobile that it‚Äôs basically impossible to play. I enjoy the game a lot but ever since the new update came around now my game wouldn‚Äôt even load because it‚Äôs so laggy. And if it did load, it would simply just crash and i would have to repeat the process again only for the same thing to continue. I haven‚Äôt played for a few days so now i‚Äôm very left behind :( I also can‚Äôt really play on the new map either as it‚Äôs also very laggy and caused my game to crash multiple times too. (I can‚Äôt play on computer because of storage reasons.)",3
"All I want to say has already been said regarding the open world aspect, incredible voice acting and detail to the plot characters and world. 

I wasn‚Äôt expecting much since I heard about it through some from recommendations and am more than pleasantly surprised by it. 

Obvious conflicts come up with gatcha games, but seeing how other games handle their lottery type ways to get items and characters compared to this game don‚Äôt even hold a flame to this. Thank you so much for all the hard work put into creating this world !",5
A few days ago I saw my friend playing this game while I was over at their house and asked him if I could play a little too after a bit and immediately fell in love.  So I put down the control and immediately went to download the game but before I hit the begin game button it asked me if I would like to download the full game so I pressed yes.  And when it finally finished downloading I went to verify my email address and then hit the begin button only to be kicked out of the app I then tried a few more times only to receive the same reaction.  I ended up just giving up after trying some stuff and deleting it off my phone.  Good game but non-downloadable.,2
This game was really fun for about the first three months i‚Äôve played it. The story quests in the game get progressively worse. I used to actually read the dialogue for the story but now I just end up skipping through it for the completion rewards. Honestly Mihoyo has really given up on the more recent story quests. Also I would like to bring up the fact that the boys in the game literally have the same faces as the girls. I was a mega Childe simp and then I really looked at him and his face has zero masculine features. He looks like a fem au of ed sheeren. Also it gave me a gambling addiction. thanks mihoyo üòöüôèüèº,4
"I love the game, I enjoy being able to play with other played too, the graphics are amazing I especially love the characters, The main problem I have been having is getting kicked from the game. I don‚Äôt know if this has only been happening to me or if it‚Äôs my iPad but every time I join the game it loads it does what it has to do but once I‚Äôm actually in the game and being able to play my screen turns black and it kicks me and takes my back to my Home Screen, I was just wondering if there is any way to fix it or if it was just my device. Please let me now üëç",4
"Before I begin, I love Genshin. I love the graphics, the story, the characters, and the inclusion of real world cultures like Mondstat-Germany and Liyue-China. The thing that holds this game back is the gacha. I understand that the gacha is how Mihoyo makes money, but the rates are horrendous and the amount of primogems given out is hilariously low. Many other gacha games out there have sparking mechanics which can guarantee a character after a certain amount of summon. Other gachas are much less stingy, giving out lots of free summons. Other gachas have better rates than Genshin. Examples included like Fire Emblem Heroes. I love the game, but the gacha is disappointing.",4
"First off, I will say it, this is essentially a Zelda botw clone. And mean just like it, and it is well executed. This is not a knock to the game, I think anyone who has played Zelda botw knows it‚Äôs an amazing game, so really this is a win, as far as game play. Great graphics, fun for exploration, fun story line so far. If they Could rid the game of the pretty consistent lag. And PLEASE put a skip button for cut scenes, I rather burn through battery on my phone playing, not watching. Overall, I‚Äôm open to adjusting my rating if these things can get squared away. Honestly, great game though. I look forward to what more it has to offer.",4
"I love this game. Everything the graphics, the story, and the characters. Words will never describe how much it means to me. I‚Äôve been playing for a few months. I‚Äôve was depressed for a good half a year before that. Something about playing this game makes everything so much better. I love the exploring it satisfies that part of me that wants to climb everywhere and jump off tall buildings. I love the music and the backstories for each character. I love this world thank Mihoyo for creating it.",5
"Quite a good game if u do say so myself, however, I have a bit of a problem. If you guys could implement maybe a one time way to transfer saves to another server would be great. My friend on EU server told me about this game and wanted me to play so of course I made an account on EU so we can play together. However now that friend doesn‚Äôt play the game anymore sadly and that‚Äôs fine because more of my friends play this game HOWEVER that‚Äôs ok global server. If you guys could please just add this maybe 1 time feature to the game it would make my day. But none of The less this is probably one of the best games I‚Äôve played so far in 2020.",4
I play this game 4-5 hours a day since it launched in fall of 2020. It amazing I can play it on my phone when I‚Äôm out and pick right up on my pc when at home. The game is tons of fun. The multiplayer could use some work but it‚Äôs not horrible. The graphics and game design are very exceptional. I will warn tho it is very pay to win in that paying is the best way to get new characters. Better odds on the free summons would be nice. The story does not require more than the character given thru normal game play which is nice considering the story is amazing. Would recommend this game to anyone.,5
"Lemme start of by saying I freaking love this game it‚Äôs caught my attention for a while and I can not stop playing it . There‚Äôs up and downs like any other game though 

1. First starters there‚Äôs so much potential for co-op and it did not deliver my friends and I were a little disappointed friends couldn‚Äôt actively open chest together and do quest together ,only domains essentially your friends are there to help the host lvl up but why not have all the players be able to have more Liberty 

2. The game runs smoothly when it wants to I‚Äôve already have had 3 friends I recommend this game to have trouble with lag ,the game not loading the world in ,the game crashing /so I suggest an option for graphic settings 
Overall the plot is great ,the settings and atmosphere immaculate (when it loads ) 

I don‚Äôt have any consoles and I wanted to play breathe of the wild so bad and you ended up bringing me something better !!",5
"Overall, it‚Äôs an okay game to kill time. Lots to explore and do until you get bored out of your mind fighting domains over and over for supplies. But the one thing that bugs me the most is the garbage responsiveness. They tried to make some high mechanical boss fights that needs quick reflexes but the camera, dashing, and attacks lag behind the command or simply doesn‚Äôt trigger at all. At first I tried to live with it, but then it keeps happening and keep getting instant killed by bosses because the characters are just standing refusing commands!!! It‚Äôs not my phone, the connection and digitizer is fine. Imagine playing smash bros when half your buttons is broken or unresponsive and joystick drifts. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like but this is the fault of the software.",1
"I downloaded the game about three weeks ago. For the last two weeks straight it has been my most used app... the game is AMAZING! It has GORGEOUS landscapes, and engaging adventures.

I typically play mindless games on my phone, as I use them as time passing tools mostly, but one of my friends told me to try this game so I did.... for the first time ever, I‚Äôve found myself sitting for HOURS on my phone playing this game. 

I HIGHLY recommend this game, especially during quarantine, it really gives you something fun to do even when everything else is boring.",5
This game isn't like other free to play games. It actually rewards you for playing and leveling up and doesn't force ads on you while you play. There is in app purchases but they aren't necessary as they give you some for free and have multiple ways of paying with items earned in-game. Takes a long time before you can play multiplayer and if I put the settings on max it overclocks the iPhone 12 Pro Max and makes it very hot and the game isn't even in 4K yet still studders while playing on 60fps. Other than that I'd give it 5 stars. Please try to make the game run smoother for iPhone 12 pro max and I'll make 5 stars,4
"This game became my favorite game in 2 days. People are saying that there are things wrong with the game but they aren't realizing  that this game was made in September and is still fairly new so give the developers sometime to figure out how to fix the bugs and everything will be ok (hopefully) anyways back to how good this game is. So when i first downloaded this game i didnt really expect much but man, this game is wonderful  i havent found a great game like this since The call of duty series and minecraft. For the people looking for new adventure games and love free roam games this is it. This will be an awesome journey",5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game. I‚Äôve been playing since December and now I‚Äôm AR 47. The story is awesome, and while I love the characters, I noticed that all of them are white. Kaeya and Xinyan have slightly darker skin tones, but I wouldn‚Äôt really call that diversity. I‚Äôm not saying they ALL have to be dark skinned, but come on, at least have maybe half of them. 
Aside from that, this game is great in my opinion. It‚Äôs just the whitewashing that has me kinda put off. I still love this game though and will continue to play it.

But please Hoyoverse, stop whitewashing all the characters.",4
Wanted to like this game. But after putting some hours into it... all I can say is it‚Äôs a boring and lame rip off of BOTW. The story is horrendously bad and extremely cringe worthy. After a couple of hours you‚Äôll have nothing left to do in the game. The Resin cap ruins your momentum. Most of the time you‚Äôre just doing mindless tasks and fighting enemies that you insanely out-damage. This game WOULD have been GREAT if it was a mmo or at least a co-op game. The co-op in this game is freaken terrible. Level caps don‚Äôt allow you to join each others games. If you‚Äôre in a friend‚Äôs game you cannot collect the chest treasures and are very limited on what you can do. You also have to reach level 16 before you can play together which is LONG and GRINDY. There‚Äôs no raid bosses that need coordination. It‚Äôs just a grindy boring game. Had potential....,1
The game is good and I think it‚Äôs great fun. The only problem is that mobile doesn‚Äôt have a controller support. The controls are mobile are wonky. And I thin controller support would be an amazing addition to the game. But till then I‚Äôll play it now and again. If I had a function able pc or console id play it there but unable to. And it‚Äôd be so much more fun to grind with a controller so I think this is a very important aspect that the devs should look into! But till controller support is here I‚Äôll be only playing it for smaller amounts of time. I look forward to the future of the game.,5
"I want to download this on my pc but it‚Äôs really bugged so I can‚Äôt for the time being... I was never a mobile person but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised- however there are just a couple things I hope they update. 

A screen lock where the screen turns with your character, my phone is really larger so having to hold and turn makes my fingers cramp up and I often need to take breaks in during battles.

MOUNTS. Traveling is painful- while some areas are plush with chests others make you walk for ten minutes through crappy wall climbs and rivers that takes FOREVER. It all apart of the grind I guess but it does get boring for someone with ADHD. 

The game is beautiful- and I look forward to the update and even would love to see this become an open world MMORPG with servers.  Although I don‚Äôt know the scale of this game but I feel like if they expand more this could become more legendary than the every famous world of Warcraft.",5
"When I first downloaded this game, I absolutely fell in love with it. It was really fun and one of those games that I would spend hours playing. But I found out that it would heat up my phone and made me lose battery super fast. So I went to download it on my laptop and the game would crash too. Then I went to download it on my iPad. It worked fine with some lag the first couple days but now I can‚Äôt even open the app. I would give this app a 5 star rating if it weren‚Äôt for this problem. Please fix this!",5
I gave this game a 1 star without even playing it myself. But after playing for about 30 hours on PC  I decided to give 5 stars. This game is amazing. For those wondering about the gacha system. It‚Äôs really not that bad unless you are a collector. I just did 1 beginner summon and have been using the characters I got from it for 30 hours. If you can master your characters you obtained from the beginner pulls you can easily beat content. The only way I would do more summons is if I get bored of using the same characters (which I‚Äôm not). Can‚Äôt wait to see the other worlds. Beidou #1 btw ü•∞,5
"The game is stunning visually, one of the most beautiful games on mobile, it doesn‚Äôt feel at all like you‚Äôre playing a mobile gacha game or mmo. It feels like a full fledged story focused adventure JRPG. Which is incredible ignoring the gacha and enjoying the story is very easy to do. 

Then comes the bad optimization the overheating, I‚Äôm playing on a iPhone 8 so I can max out the graphics have a few hiccups which is alright but when it crashes like after every 20-30mins like srsly it just kills the mood, and you don‚Äôt feel like hoping back in just to face the crashes again! Once this crash update fixes. I‚Äôll rate it a full 5*s, till then imma have to keep like this. I‚Äôve played Honkai impact and I never had issues like this! So fix it fast MiHoyo.",2
"I‚Äôve played Genshin for a while now and I love it. I finally got my favorite character Kamisato Ayaka. I was super happy. But there‚Äôs another character who really needs a rerun. Eula. She he and Ayaka deserved that rerun especially shenhe because it was actually her first rerun. But there‚Äôs a character who really needs a rerun that character is Eula. It has been over a year since Eula had a rerun. I myself am not a Eula wanter. But, I am speaking for those who are Eula wanters.  Not to mention I just found out that Eula will not be present in 3.6. But please for Eula wanters make her rerun soon.",5
"Hi let me start off by saying that I‚Äôm playing this on iOS. So my problem is that I got to the screen that was there for loading the full version of the game but I have waited about a day and a half and it is still not loaded. It‚Äôs going up little by little and taking so much time. If you have a solution to make this go faster I would really appreciate it.

Edit: after two days it finished loaded and I will tell you it is worth the wait 5 out of 5 for me",5
"Yes, this game is quite action-packed but you can tell that a lot of it was loosely based off of other games‚Ä¶ the most evident being Nintendo‚Äôs BoTW. I know this has been said many times before, but if it wasn‚Äôt such a clone, I think I would‚Äôve personally liked it more. The content is dry and boring, the quests are annoying and way to long, with 90% of just talking. The map is way to littered with enemies to even enjoy the graphics or beauty. Character designs are the same, with only a handful of body types and color pallets. And the lack of detail in some areas is unreal! The npcs are plain and tasteless, with a flat and quite sad finish. They are to bland to face the playable characters. Honestly a disappointing game, what a shame.",1
"The only reason why I‚Äôm giving this game 4 out of five stars is because of how much room on my iPhone it requires. Took up nearly all of my space and I had to offload many apps for the game to even work with the full download. Now it won‚Äôt let me even play because the new update takes WAY more GB than I can offer willingly. If there‚Äôs anyway you can fix this, please try. For the few days I‚Äôve been playing I had a blast! I loved the art style and mechanics, the elements, Characters and etc! Truly loved playing this game and am sad I couldn‚Äôt continue with it.",4
"Overall i like the game I would have gave it a 5/5 star, but it deserves a 4/5 star bc there is one quest called the defeat the miasmic tumor and it‚Äôs very hard to do when you have a tumor literally shooting stuff at you and you have to fight every time the tumor goes back up, plus there also electro stuff that‚Äôs killing you, and it kills you very quick, pls genshin either make the purple stuff stop killing you very fast or make the puzzles a bit easier than the way it is‚Ä¶ but overall it‚Äôs a good game to play but it‚Äôs just that quest that‚Äôs annoying asf‚Ä¶",4
"Although the game is very fun to play and has lots of places to explore and enemies to fight and new plot points, they don‚Äôt have much in terms of skin tone

I am pretty pale myself and the fact that even with Sumeru coming the darkest character isn‚Äôt even darker than me strikes a bit of a error if they are trying to base the characters off of who they claim to be based off of

So far their are two brown skinned characters xinyan, and kaeya that you can get by wishing but with these new characters who are from Sumeru they are all even paler than me even though they come from a country based off of middle eastern and south Asian culture. It comes off as odd and is misrepresenting those places and cultures",2
"I am a big fan of Genshin Impact but I did quickly realize that there no Vietnamese character. I am Vietnamese so it really bothers me to not have a single Vietnamese character. I would love to have a banner with two Vietnamese characters. I would also want one to be a 4 star and a 5 star. If you make these characters, please make them good characters that people would like and use. If you make these characters, it would be really nice if you gave people a free 4 star Vietnamese character. Me and one of my best friends really want Vietnamese characters.
Please make two Vietnamese characters.",4
"I mean, like it‚Äôs a great game if it didn‚Äôt have so space to take‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs an Awesome game!! But still if it didn‚Äôt have a lot of space, also I understand it won‚Äôt allow music from other apps but like, STILL I wanna play my favorite songs!!! Great game however you spell your name but I wanna play music from other apps! üòí Also why do you have a setting to turn off the genshin music, but when I turn it off, I STILL can‚Äôt play my favorite songs. I would love it when you turn it off you can play songs from other apps!",5
"This game is amazing. It has so much detail, from the music, world building, and the characters. There are so many things you can do to keep yourself occupied. I really like the fighting mechanics, although I wish there was a setting to change thumbstick in the bottom left of the screen, it was a little difficult for me to use personally. But sadly, I had to delete the game because my phone was having issues with the iCloud backup. If I could, I would definitely download this game again. 10/10 :)",5
"although i hope it can come to macbooks and stuff, this game is the BEST - first, it‚Äôs easy to learn and although the gacha system makes me mad, it‚Äôs so fun to wish. there‚Äôs lore and it‚Äôs interesting. my favorite quest was when i had to visit ningguang in her jade chamber or when we had to fight the sea monster and i received blessings from xiao and the others. i am a lowly ar32, but i hope to grow more :)
i had a friend who used to hate genshin and refuse to play, but now he‚Äôs so mad that he can‚Äôt reach ar16 üò≠
anyway, best game ever, and i love playing <3",5
"I just wanna say that am very upset about the new sumeru characters and very disappointed. Why? U may ask, because of the way hoyoverse made the half of the sumeru characters all pale. Especially the main reason why am very upset. Is because of the way your whitewashing the characters and how sumeru is part of Indian culture and south asians and the way ur taking what represent them most. i would love it if hoyoverse didn‚Äôt take all the melanin from the characters and made the characters how they are supposed to be. I hope hoyoverse reads this and understands that this is not okey and I would like it if they showed more dark skinned characters. Finally hopefully they change the sumeru characters please and thank you.",2
"Yes the game is good but it is very hard to get primogems. Well I mean I know that you can easily get 60 primogems from doing commissions and ad astra abbesosque-ing but I feel like it‚Äôs gonna be so long to get a whole 1600 for a full pull, and then you end up getting no one. And I‚Äôve pulled for Kamisato Ayato many many times and I still have got him. I‚Äôve only gotten Xiangling. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something I need to fix, but I‚Äôve done more than 50 pulls for him and I still haven‚Äôt gotten him. I guess it‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt have great luck.",5
"So I first started when I saw a bunch of ads and then I finally decided to download it. It looked really cool on the ads and I thought I could try it out. When I first started, I loved the graphics and the animation. At the start when I met Amber and got her I was obsessed. Later on, I got used to the game and um‚Ä¶ my grades fell a lil. I fixed it now, don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs just REALLY addicting. I recommended it to all my school friends, BFFs, Family and online friends! I love this game because it has a great storyline. Keep up the work and I adore y‚Äôall‚Äôs game! ü•≥üòÖü•∞üòÖüòùüòÅüò©ü§™",5
As you saw in the title it is good but it doesn‚Äôt let me enter any since hu tao banner and so I would like this to be fixed because I have deleted many apps just to play this game so I would like mihoyo to fix this I have tried every day trying to get in‚Ä¶but I cannot for some reason and I DO NOT want to lose all the progression I have done so please fix in an update. But it really is a good game and has good characters and I love it this is just one of my complaints the second is really not THAT important‚Ä¶but I always‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶kinda‚Ä¶get crashed when I do co-op so I also want that fixed hehe‚Ä¶,4
"Well, genshin impact is an amazing game but there is just one problems. When I try to load into where I left off I get stuck in this loading screen. I looked up on how to fix it and none of it worked. I got so fed up with so I deleted it. After some months went by I decided to give it another chance but then after about three days of playing it, it started to do the exact same thing. I just find it very frustrating. Yes it is a very good game but the errors that just occurs randomly inside it makes it lose all my excitement for it",4
Hello love the game but I find myself playing it less and less because of the character leveling system. It‚Äôs almost pointless to wish for new characters because it take forever to level them up. I can‚Äôt enjoy the story or the new characters because I find myself stuck will low level characters that die all the time so then I have to spend days trying to get EXP material to get past enemies and through the story. I would love to recommend this to friends be don‚Äôt because of this issue. I wish you guys would give you exp for fighting like other games or put a lot more exp materials in.,3
"These are very simple requests disregarding the crit rate.

Kokomi‚Äôs really difficult to fight with when she takes a while to move after her attack, I don‚Äôt have a problem with that with Yanfei but I‚Äôd like Kokomi to be fixed. One is being able to rearrange the jellyfish healer, and the second one is letting her move better after her attacks because I don‚Äôt want to keep wasting stamina. The third is if she‚Äôs a 5 star, why can‚Äôt she travel on water without using her ult like Mona and some other 5 stars? It‚Äôs a shame you nerfed her walking on water when that bug is actually enjoyable to players.

Otherwise she‚Äôs really fun to play with, I just want her to be more easy to play with.",2
"I have been playing this game for a long time and I really like it. But when Update 2.0 came out, I‚Äôve been seeing excessive crashing every several minutes. Also, it shows the glitch in the software when I see red and black pixels flashing for several milliseconds on screen. The software glitch is still isn‚Äôt fixed‚Ä¶ yet, and hundreds of people have reported this situation. This is an awesome game, it‚Äôs just that the glitch makes my device crash. Please fix this so I can enjoy the nonstop gameplay on my device. Thank you.",4
"These predatory business practices of selling gambling to kids 12 and up needs to stop. We need to get together and send messages to our government representatives for now laws and regulations so it stops .these companies make too much money to care about the harm they cause.

Now maybe it will let me add to this without deleting it, I want to add even after all this drama they still refuse to update the game and refuse to make raising characters fair. They expect you pay for refreshes and such, I never seen a game strong arm someone so hard to raise chrs. They do that because they have a limited number of chrs with no content so most of the content is around leveling and gearing characters.

Fix this game and I will put money in it",1
"This game is flawless in almost every way. Unfortunately even making millions in its first year, they give us a anniversary that is worse than the start up rewards. Millions are in edge and upset and there is no response from Mihoyo. Thank you for appreciating your players (sarcasm). No point in playing this game if all you‚Äôll get for being a committed and dedicated player is just a CHANCE to win  $10 worth in prizes if you do cosplay or art which could cost hundreds to thousands that could advertise your game you greedy gremlins.",5
"Lack of true endgame content, once you hit AR 55 be prepared to grind exp for months between AR rank to receive one measly wish. The only ""endgame"" is abyss and even once you are able to 36* it leaves nothing of value to do. Theres nothing to co op with your friends for since everything is already pathetically easy to beat by urself (or even faster on your own because of how co op enemy HP/DEF scaling works). No, I'm not a whale either, I've simply played this game for nearly a year and all my characters are overpowered at this point. Also on top of that the company is stingy and has a lack of gratitude towards the people who do free promo in the form of artwork, cosplays, fanfiction, or even simply discussing the game.  They need to do better.",2
"Everything in regards to the game itself is at least fine or great for a gatcha game. It‚Äôs best played in short durations of about half an hour toward the end game. Do that and you‚Äôll enjoy the game itself. 

But, I wrote this review mainly because of how the managers of Genshin is handling the game. So many issues, so many complaints, and at this point I don‚Äôt think people care about the anniversary rewards or if those things get fixed. It‚Äôs just the lack of respect toward the community by refusing to acknowledge any of the problems, some of which have been plaguing the game for a year. 

The radio silence between the management team and the community really kills any enthusiasm to play. It seems like a PR disaster and I can‚Äôt imagine who or why they insist on ignoring every problem.",1
"I‚Äôve played several gachas and this anniv‚Äôs rewards pale in comparison to the others. It honestly feels like Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt listen to community anymore. Lately, the quality of the game has been going downhill and somewhere along the way, they seem to have lost their magic with this game. Several characters have issues with their kits that the community has expressed but Mihoyo has turned a blind eye to. The story-telling has fallen hard in quality, this Inazuma patch felt so rushed. I‚Äôm sure Mihoyo is aware of the community‚Äôs frustrations and displeasure with the 1st anniversary rewards, but they insist to stand their ground. Nothing really feels special about this anniversary, nothing to commemorate for. Everything has to be shared for rewards which is not right",1
"I've been playing Genshin Impact since the day it came out a year ago. It's truly a fun game with great graphics and an interesting storyline! However, Mihoyo is so greedy. They didn't even give us enough primogems for a single pull for their one year anniversary. As well as never giving us any timeline for upcoming characters until 3-7 days before their release so that people don't have time to save up. If Mihoyo had more timely and in depth announcements, players wouldn't have to turn to leakers in order to keep their interest in the game. I just wish Mihoyo would learn to be less greedy and more generous toward the community. I truly do wish I could give the game 5 stars, but until Mihoyo address their greed, my review will have to stay at 1 star.",1
"I know what your planing... I had to delete 7 apps for you and the last update, you tuned my phone into a dessert. Not an app in sight other then Genshin. 

You won‚Äôt get away with this. I know your trying to make us addicted to it. It‚Äôs my 7th week playing. I‚Äôve discovered everyone and everything I can. I almost icebridged to inasuma before I got struck by lighting.

You are manipulating us into playing your game, and I‚Äôd hate to say it. But it‚Äôs working. Tell my family I love them. I‚Äôm to addicted to stop playing and talk to them.",5
"I was just making space on my iPad and thought to maybe check if there was a good game I could download. I downloaded this game, and I‚Äôm now addicted to it. It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful games I‚Äôve played. It has a fair gacha system, beautiful world to explore, and much more. I WILL SAY it takes up a lot of storage space, and took me more than 2 hours to download. This might be different for some people, but just keep this in mind :) otherwise, I love this game to celestia and back. TOTALLY RECOMEND IT FOR EVERYONE.",5
"I play it everyday day is 100% deserves 5 out of 5. A friend of mine has a 8 year old sister and I showed it to her and she loves it so 8 is really I good age to play ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.if your a mature. But it‚Äôs so fun to play with friends. And there is so much to do. And it is A RPG fighting game but it‚Äôs not scary at all . And you don‚Äôt need to spend money at all . But you can if your play it enough to want to .I mainly don‚Äôt have any trouble with the game and if you ever played legend of Zelda breath of the wild, it‚Äôs a lot like it but better with more characters, weapons, and quests. So overall AMAZING GAME!",5
"I just download this game about 2 weeks ago, and I got to adventure rank 28 just now! It‚Äôs an easy game but it is hard to master. Games like that are the most addictive. Great job!! But I really want the option to change what twin you have, recently I‚Äôve been dying to have the male twin and I would appreciate if you could add that feature!!! Other than that I love this game so much. I play on my phone and it only lags when my phone overheats. Avoiding that, the game never lags!! The characters are so lovable. I love this so much!!!",5
"I love this game, i can honestly play it for hours. however when i go around the area of liyue ( rocky area) there‚Äôs a whole bunch of enemies over there (which isn‚Äôt a problem yet may possibly be the fuel to the problem) there would be like this weird glitch of my screen of glitching color and it‚Äôs weird when i hit an enemy... idk if that‚Äôs to set the tone of gameplay or just my game system having an overload but either this is my favorite game and i would hit for it to be glitched out by doing certain tasks

CAN WE PLEASE FIX THE WORLD RANK SYSTEM TO COWORK WITH OUR ACTUAL CHARACTER LEVELS??? IM WORLD 5 FIGHTING LEVEL 70+ WHILE MY CHARACTERS HAVENT RVEN TRACHED LVL 50",5
I can‚Äôt install the pc version of the game. It just keeps saying failed to check for updates. I have tried every fix there is and nothing works. The community is no help they just tell me to do things I have said already didn‚Äôt work. I have put way to much effort into trying to get this game to work! At this point the game would have to be on the same level as big name games like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim to even be worth all the trouble and It‚Äôs not. I did play the mobile version just to see if it‚Äôs good and it‚Äôs just a ok game at best. You know the only reason people like this game is because of the anime girls! Skip messing with this game and just go watch henti or get some Skyrim mods! Or better yet get a life and go outside!,1
"I love this game so so much! I can never get bored of it, even though I‚Äôm AR 52 and have no quests to do.
The events and character banners are so fun, each one breathes new life into this game. Plus I‚Äôm in love with the Genshin men (ChildeüòÅ‚ÄºÔ∏è) 
If you are looking whether to get this game or not, this is your sign to get it! I wish I could of gotten into this game earlier, this is your time to start! Better sooner than later !!!!
Anyways thank you Mihoyo. This game has helped me through so many times, and I just love this game so much. It holds a very special place in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"When I had this game on my device, it was pretty amazing! I liked the story line and the characters looked amazing, of course it took a lot of space on my device. But I don‚Äôt feel like that should take away stars from the rating. Neither the fact that you have to register in order to get into the game.. all games do that and it‚Äôs normal. To anyone who gives it 1 star saying that you couldn‚Äôt load it or anything like that, it‚Äôs your device.. not their game. Anyway, pretty well done! :>
Amazing graphics, did find some bugs here are there, but it was great!",5
"I was so excited to start playing this game after hearing about how amazing the graphics looked and how cool everything was. I‚Äôm a big anime mmorpg fan, I‚Äôve been playing them for years and years. I cleared up a lot of space and downloaded the game, once everything was in place I noticed that there isn‚Äôt any sort of character customization...even though it‚Äôs an online game. This game had so much potential but I deleted it after I found out there‚Äôs no customization, it‚Äôs truly disappointing. I would happily re download this game in the future if a character customization update was implemented, and I know a lot of people feel the same way. Cheers.",3
"i would‚Äôve given it five stars if not for one key factor, genshin whitewashes every single character, and i mean THEY ARE MINT WHITE, regions like sumeru, where characters are supposed to have more representation because sumeru is based off of india, iraq and other POC countries, THERE ARE ONLY 2 CHARACTER IN SUMERU THAT ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY TAN, not to mention how absolutely money hungry hoyoverse is, a lot of sponsored youtubers claim that it‚Äôs fun even if it‚Äôs free to play. eventually you will find yourself spending money, no matter how big or small the purchase, you will find yourself consistently gambling. anyway that is my review goodbye",4
"Words cannot describe how much I enjoy this game! I just cannot stop playing it, every bit of it is so exciting. It definitely has that ‚ÄúBreath of the Wild‚Äù style feel to it, but with a more variety of characters to choose from. Along with a great story, loads of side quests, and plenty of monsters to fight to keep players on their toes, the possibilities are endless.

The game also has this anime-like feel in my opinion! I can almost imagine them making an animation like series, if it keeps going well.",5
"For a free game (yes there are IAPs), the amount of open and accessible content is absolutely mind-blowing.  The graphics are stunning.  The world has a ton of depth.  The storylines are interesting.  Hours and hours of fun.  There are enough leveling subsystems in the game to feel like you have choices in how to progress (weapons, characters, gear, talents) but not so much it‚Äôs overwhelming.  Travel markers make it quick and easy to get around as you explore the map, which is a really nice quality of life feature for completing things in different areas of the (expansive) map. Highly recommend this game.",5
"It‚Äôs a rly beautiful game and the missions are fun and creative, but it gets hard to get characters later on and basically impossible to the point where u have to spend money. if you get this game, be prepared to either have to put HOURS into it just to level up once, or prepare to put some money into it. And even if you put money into it nothing is guaranteed, i spent about 50$ on this game and have gotten nothing so far, but alas, the game is very beautiful and reminds me of breath of the wild. The soundtrack is nice and basically everything about the game is very pretty :)",5
"I don‚Äôt really know how long i‚Äôve been playing for but i‚Äôm addicted to the game. Everything about Genshin is just so good. The characters, cities, landscapes, art, and the whole game itself. The only issue i‚Äôm having is trying to buy genesis and logging in. It leaves me on the white loading screen you see when you first get in the game or it keeps crashing. It also won‚Äôt let me buy genesis which is annoying but overall Genshin Impact is one of my favorite games. I have so much fun playing this wonderful magical game!",5
"The game looks great an all but the demo version already has a lot of lag and such, and at the beginning where I choose the sibling I can only see a fraction on the animation and when I downloaded the full version I could not even play the game it always kicks me out. It‚Äôs most likely my phone but the lag is probably on a lot of other mobile devices. The game kicking me out is most likely due to my phone if you can make it better for mobile I would deeply appreciate that.",5
"I got this game yesterday and I‚Äôm addicted to it, but suddenly there was a thing, where whenever I opened the app it would just stay on a white screen forever, before automatically closing the app. I just really hope this gets fixed. I‚Äôve tried redownloading the app and everything, nothing works. I really hope the response to this (if I do get a response at all) isn‚Äôt the automated ‚Äúgo to our email for your issues‚Äù response, because that provides no help whatsoever. Thank you!",5
"So I was looking for a new game to play to pass the time, and I was going through the App Store and saw this. I was SO excited because I‚Äôve never played any game like Genshin Impact. So I downloaded the game, even though it took an entire 4 days to download, I was so excited I just didn‚Äôt care ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So finally, I opened up the game and it was amazing until I realized it just wasn‚Äôt going to load on my iPad, it was VERY glitchy, so I didn‚Äôt really get to listen to the opening ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so I deleted the app, but I‚Äôm going to download it on my computer as soon as possible!",5
"Honestly it‚Äôs been a long time since I found an amazing game like this. I played honkai impact and it was absolutely amazing but once I saw ads for genshin I knew it was going to be amazing. And it did not disappoint. My only problem is, is that it‚Äôs annoying how you have to level up your adventure rank to continue on with the quests and it‚Äôs pretty easy it just takes some time but, sometimes the quests are like continue when at adventure rank level 18 and im only at 15. It‚Äôs a bit annoying but overall an AMAZING game.",5
"Probably the best game I‚Äôve ever played, I thought it was only on the phone and I was super bummed because I thought it‚Äôd be amazing to play like on PS4 because the open world concept is phenomenally executed within this game, and turns out it is downloadable on PS4, although you can‚Äôt log into the account you used for your phone so I had to restart after having completed a couple weeks of gameplay but that‚Äôs fine, i don‚Äôt mind personally. But this game is better than ones I‚Äôve paid for that didn‚Äôt have such a vast amount of content in game, it‚Äôs really amazing",5
"Soooo this isn‚Äôt a problem with higher quality devices but maybe add it to theirs too, I (and many others) have this low vision glitch were it only allows us to see in the direction around us, this makes features in characters dangerous to use and there‚Äôs also this bug we‚Äôre we have to refresh the app when there‚Äôs a cutscene so we have to wait longer to beat the game, I feel like this is caused due to not being able to change the quality to be even lower than the auto quality we get, or maybe it‚Äôs some bugs, I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôll change my opinion if this bug gets fixed",3
It‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôve wished to find a game like this for so longggg! I have only one idea to make it even more fun and open a whole new way to play the game. I wish we could build and buy houses. Like making some of the buildings in the cities and villages customizable houses that you can buy and having the option to build your own house wherever you want so you can pick the location and live as secluded as you want. That feature alone would make this my absolute dream game and I think a lot of other people would enjoy it too.,5
"Yes it has some paid features but I probably have 15-20 hours in and have yet had to spend a penny on this game, in fact I more than likely will spend money just to support this game. For a free to play game this goes above and beyond easy to follow story fun combat giant open and detailed world. The art style is fantastic very much BOTW a lot of the features are similar as well but it sets its self apart enough that it doesn‚Äôt just feel like a knock off. I was super skeptical about downloading this game but I do have to say I‚Äôm happily impressed. Recommend everyone give this game a try",5
When I started to play the audio was scratchy and the video kept on freezing so I wasn‚Äôt able to see anything and then when I started to play as my character and I didn‚Äôt see the environment cause all I saw was black and the only thing I saw is my character and the green ground so then when I started to walk a light would pop up and I could not see my character and where I was going and then any cutscene I wouldn‚Äôt see anything and I could barely under stand the audio then I got to the first boss and I could not see anything at all  so I exited out of the game and came back it did the same thing so when I would not recommend my friends to play this game because it is really bad unless you change these things for this mobile game cause right now this game is not it,1
"I‚Äôm using an IPad 5th generation and when I look at water or the sky there is only a black void. I‚Äôm really hoping this gets fixed because I just started playing the game and it seems to be really fun and also has decent graphics (if they load). Sometimes there is also a huge blinding white spot when I would try and go into the water or if I moved a certain way. Also during the intro video it kept glitching in the video and audio track, mainly dragging out words for long periods of time and freezing on a frame while the audio kept going. I hope to hear from the creator and or team of possibly how to fix this problem because I do enjoy the game.",3
"I would give this 5 stars. I really would. But until they fix the file size of the game, there is no way they‚Äôre gaining me back as a player. I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and a half now, reached AR57, but also deleted nearly half of my photos on my 128gb phone to have this game. I don‚Äôt have any other major games except for this one. There is no reason for the game to be 20gb big and yet be lacking in so many other fundamental gaming elements. Cannot download again, cannot return deleted photos, and will not return to this game until there is a public announcement and apology by Hoyo for making it so big + compressing it into a better version.",2
"I‚Äôd like to consider myself a bit of a veteran in this game. It‚Äôs designs and mechanics are amazing as well as the audio and music. While I do have some issues, I‚Äôd like to address the best parts of this game first.

 The environment is so exciting to explore and it‚Äôs super relaxing. The fights aren‚Äôt to difficult for the adventure rank you are, it‚Äôs paced. The characters (my favorite being Raiden shogun) are stunning and their VAs did absolutely amazing. 

Now for my concerns:
Hoyo. Listen. You‚Äôve heard it so many times. Please just either give us more primos or lower the wishing cost. Do you know how many people would still be playing? Cmon. I know it‚Äôs not your favorite series but‚Ä¶
Also. Farming artifacts. Why not add a setting to where you can send characters out on expeditions for them or something? It‚Äôs a pain. That‚Äôs all. You‚Äôll still make millions off this game hoyo.",5
"I used to have a job, 2 kids, and a wife. One day, I was a little bored, so I downloaded this game. 10 seconds after opening this app, my boss fired me. Then my wife told me she couldn‚Äôt handle me anymore. She left with the kids, even my dog left! I had to leave my house in Malibu to live on the streets of Ohio. 2 weeks later, I was abducted by aliens. They were going to probe me, but then they realized I played genshin impact. They then threw me out into space. Moral of the story, download this game. 10/10 experience, would do again.",5
So‚Ä¶ yeah genshin is 1 of the best games ever it‚Äôs so fun to get new characters and level them up Genshin has been a journey of mine in the past 2 years of Covid it‚Äôs so fun to just sit down after school play Genshin and eat candy or food it‚Äôs such a calming yet exciting game to play sure it takes my money but‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs all worth it in the end I got venti on my 50/50 and that was so fun! I also have Jean zhongli and Qiqi those are some of my 5 stars hopefully soon nahida and hu Tao I love this game with all my heart and I totally recommend getting it you won‚Äôt regret it!,5
"Genshin impact is the best although it take ton of storage to you mobile. Overall is has been a long journey reaching ar 55 the first time I played genshin I didn‚Äôt understand what to do I ask one of my friend to help since they join genshin since it been released. Over time j got use to, it was exploring, collecting weapon and character, and joining other people world. It‚Äôs very fun and sometime I get jealous when my friends got the character that I want. That all I have to say, thank you mihoyo for making this game I absolutely love it!!",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for over a year now. I‚Äôve leveled my main team all the way up, my worlds bosses are over 80, and for some reason I never get the big monster drops. I take on a cryoregisvine a hundred times and only ever get fragments and slivers, I‚Äôm at the point where I need chunks and gemstones which are supposed to be dropped by 80+ monsters. It‚Äôs not just the cryo flowers either it‚Äôs all the bosses. If I‚Äôm defeating 80+ bosses I should get big drops. It‚Äôs a great game, great graphics, and this isn‚Äôt going to make me quit the game, but I seriously think it‚Äôs something that needs fixed.",4
"I was expecting this game to have a diversity not only in cultures but in skin tones as well. It‚Äôs disappointing seeing how this is supposed to be a game about every world‚Äôs cultural areas yet cannot properly represent it. The company has made a lot of money yet cannot find the time to make dark skin tones for not only npcs but for playable characters as well. I hope to see more diversity in the game soon but if not I might just have to fine another open world game that has proper diversity. And this is my point a view, the community as well has a similar point of view as mine but HoYoverse never listens to their communities from neither regional servers. I hope this game and the company take the time to listen to players about character design. :/",1
"The game looks really cool to be honest
Id love to play it, and the backgrounds look awesome 
However, it has simply way to much data for mobile 
It glitches a ton and isn't fluid whatsoever
I played for about an hour and didn't even get to a place where there was too much to load and it crashed 
But instead of a normal game that'll crash the app, and maybe at most freeze your screen - it crashed the entire iPad
Its like i turned it off completely, or dropped it in water
Took 20 minutes of me messing with the on button for it to finally turn back on 
I tried one more time and the same thing happened
So i deleted the app, and even still my iPad will be overloaded and completely shut off
Im and artist and all my art is saved of this iPad - 1000+ hours of work that could be in danger of being completely lost if this iPad crashes 
So if you are interested in playing it then please take into consideration what you would lose if it breaks your device",3
"People in the Genshin Impact community have asked for dark skinned representation since the release. The only two playable dark skinned characters are Xinyan and Kaeya. With Sumeru‚Äôs release you would think there would be more darker skinned people since its, you know, based off darker skinned culture? Nope! The clothing representation is awful, and they cannot even pronounce the characters name correctly! Worst part is that most of them are based off real people. Candace is SO much lighter than who she is supposed to be based off of. People have emailed Hoyoverse complaining about this, but a stupid ‚ÄúPaimon is sorry!‚Äù email is just sent back. Hoyoverse needs to start LISTENING to their fanbase, or there will be more decline in players AND in purchases.",1
"There are two major things that made me quit this game.

The first one is that the higher you level up, the harder it is to do really anything. I understand that‚Äôs the point, but it simply isn‚Äôt the same experience anymore from when I first started and enjoyed everything.

The second one is the lack of diversity, especially from the leaks. I‚Äôve never seen an actual black person in the game, ever. The darkest is probably golden tan and that‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs really disappointing to see, especially since they‚Äôve made certain characters out of stereotypes yet still couldn‚Äôt get the skin tone right.",3
"That is an RPG world with many things to do along with characters items, weapons. They have their own character designs and personality which makes it intriguing. My request is to lower the files. A bunch of people have storage problems. It‚Äôs probably not possible but at least it‚Äôs worth asking :‚Äô). A lot of people are complaining about sumeru characters and well..there isn‚Äôt a variety of black characters (2) At least please add 2 more. Anyways..besides all of that the game is amazing! I love it!",5
"I love everything about this game. The story, the characters, and the beautiful environments are of a consistent quality you can‚Äôt find in other games! I‚Äôve spent a lot on the gacha system to roll for character and I have zero regrets. The community is also a lot of fun because Hoyoverse puts a lot of effort into their Hoyolab app, promoting artists, etc. Now that I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and I‚Äôm still excited for every new event and update, I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôll be playing until the end!",5
"Hoyoverse communicates poorly with their players and hardly makes any changes based on the players feedback unless it‚Äôs affecting them negatively (monetarily). One of the changes they refuse to make is adding more skin tones and culturally appropriate attire for their POC characters. There shouldn‚Äôt be 3 tan skin characters out of 50 if the newest region, Sumeru, is based on the Middle East and SWANA cultures. (All the NPCS are pale too. ) Not to mention all the tan skin characters are only four stars (lower in rarity) compared to their paler counterparts. Hoyoverse does also have a track history of bad darker skinned representation such as Carol and her mom from Honkai impact. And as a POC person, I am uncomfortable playing knowing majority of the characters that share my skin tone are egregious stereotypes or created shallowly.",1
"Great game of course! Everything is amazing except this one thing, its that sometimes things aren't specific enough to the point where i can't understand it, like for downloading if it says your storage is full, its very vague about what i should do to fix it and what amount of storage it will take up. Literally everything else is amazing and nothing is wrong except for that! Genshin Impact is my favorite game, too bad i cant play it since i can't download the updates tho.",5
"I really didn‚Äôt like how much hype this game had around it, so I tried it to see if it was warranted. 

It was not.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a great game. The things that throw me off so much is the rediculous amount of grinding and the essential pay-to-win aspect. It‚Äôs so much harder to level up without buying anything, so at that point you have to choose between mindlessly grinding for hours on end, or spend a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù money to help you out, then you get put in that situation again and again until it isn‚Äôt just a little bit of money anymore. I didn‚Äôt experience this myself, so you can definitely control yourself if you have the willpower, but I witnessed a close friend fall victim to this, eventually sinking over $100 USD into waifus.

"I love all the little bitty details the creators of this game had included, and all the characters. I bet they‚Äôve spent much time not copying every character‚Äôs name in this game except the Katherines‚Äô names.I love how every version they include more and different characters, instead of leaving it as it is. Even though it‚Äôs hard to achieve a certain character, I like how they don‚Äôt just give it to you on the first try and make you work hard for it. Honestly, I‚Äôd recommend this game to almost everyone if I could.",5
Genshin is amazing even tho it lags and kicks me out I also really enjoy it their other game tears of themis?? Is also really good I‚Äôve been playing  Genshin impact since January last year on my PlayStation network account until got logged out so I started on mobile üòä moblie may have a small screen but it works!! The characters are really pretty and handsome the bosses are not hard but not easy so I guess it‚Äôs in the middle. Am on AR22 and I really want to go to inazuma quick because over their is beautiful the cherry blossoms üòçüòçüòç,5
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact sense January of 2021 and I‚Äôve definitely been having a fun time playing! The characters, story, quests‚Ä¶ everything is great, but there‚Äôs one problem; The amount storage of storage it takes up. It took up 17gb‚Äôs on my IPhone! I ended up having to delete it from my IPhone and had to start playing on my IPad because I didn‚Äôt have the storage for it on my IPhone anymore.
This storage problem bothers me still though because there‚Äôs still a lot that is gonna be added to the game, meaning it‚Äôs gonna take up a lot more storage.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while now, and I‚Äôm in the adventure rank 50-55 range. The storyline, graphics, and characters are all REALLY good! It‚Äôs only that when you are around this range, you really have nothing to do but try your luck to get characters..  In my honest opinion, there should be more hangout events, story quests etc to keep end-game players motivated to keep playing. Also, the rewards are a little bit underwhelming.. I mean your other game ‚ÄúHonkai Impact 3rd‚Äù gives out awesome rewards, but maybe just a little bit more primogems for achievements and this game is AWESOME : D",4
"Okay so Genshin is by far the best game I have ever played, and it is my favorite. The stories and the cutscenes are awesome, and the gameplay is fun. I really enjoy this game, but for some reason after the 2.5 update got released, I couldn't update the app. I kept on clicking the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù button on the app store, but after it got to 100% it said ‚Äúupdate‚Äù all over again. This frustrates me, and I really was looking forward to this update. Please fix this! :(

Although it might be apple‚Äôs fault, I am still rating this 4 stars. I might update it if this problem gets fixed.",4
"So when I started this game it was very difficult to get passed the starting point and trying to just stay alive, but once you get passed all of that its really fun with wishing to having a adventure!I have been playing for a year or so and I decided to restart and that way it was way more fun especially with all the new characters that came out!There is no glitches or bugs besides that it takes awhile to load if your joining someone but i do really recommend this game if you seemed interested!„Ç∑",5
"I really really LOVE THIS GAME 

It‚Äôs really fun with the excitement of wishing for characters, doing new story quest, defeating bosses, and more!

I‚Äôm ar 34 right night with some pretty good characters and I‚Äôm enjoying the game a lot

I‚Äôm not going to give it lower stars because of my problems though. I play on phone and yes it‚Äôs going to be laggy and crash on phone sometimes. Just beware of that. 

This really isn‚Äôt the games fault. It‚Äôs not really meant for phones and iPads if you don‚Äôt have a bunch of storage but you can still play on it, it will just be laggy or crash like a lot. If you have a Pc or PlayStation I recommend you playing on there!

Update: I had to uninstall the game due to storage issues but hope to get it back soon

It‚Äôs almost the new year and haven‚Äôt got it yet hope to soon though

Otherwise I LOVE the game and it‚Äôs so addicting 

I just play it the whole day sometimes lol

I miss genshin sooo much and can‚Äôt wait to get it again :(",4
"Very good game though it takes up a lot of storage. I don‚Äôt know if I would really recommend it but f2p players really get the least benefits from this; which really means you would either have to skip a crazy amount of banners to save from the small amount of primos you get a day or you would have to whale. I don‚Äôt think that is really fair, especially with the rewards part. Other than that, there are some bugs I‚Äôve found but they haven‚Äôt been fixed yet. Graphics are good apart from that and I really do enjoy playing this game, but I would be more willing to recommend and spend money on it if these issues were fixed.
Thank you.",2
I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time now and it‚Äôs really fun! I‚Äôm so glad that inazuma is finally out and late game genshin players like myself have new content! I really did wish I could play on my phone again but I get it this game takes lots of storage but for me it‚Äôs worth it loll I do hope you give us more primos tho I know you gave out 12-16 primos for commissions in the cbt 2‚Ä¶. The art and music are amazing!!! The game still looks beautiful even tho it‚Äôs at the lowest graphics lolll,5
"The graphics are gorgeous and the story is pretty solid, but that‚Äôs about where the pros end. The racial stereotypes, the way the company thanks the players, and the way they thank artists, too is insulting to say the least. Not to mention the gacha system is terrible and you HAVE to use it to make your characters stronger (not including the traveler). It isn‚Äôt necessarily pay to win, but your chances at having good stats while being completely free to play are far too slim to be fair. I was a light spender before uninstalling, and I only got a single 5 star by the time I was adventure rank 35. By the way, this 5 star didn‚Äôt come from the beginner‚Äôs wish banner. You aren‚Äôt guaranteed a 5 star on that banner.",2
"The game is such an amazing thing. The graphics are cool and everything but on mobile there‚Äôs a lot of problems. The game was created to be a mobile game but it feels like it‚Äôs not like that anymore. My game crashes every second and it takes forever to load. It would be best id it was also on switch. Another problem I have is the lack of black characters, many people are fighting over whether Xinyan is black or just tanned Chinese. I‚Äôd just like to see more black representation in this media and media in GENERAL. Overall this game is very good and the story line is too.",4
"well mihoyo's server maintenance rewards are way better than the anniversary gems for starters, and don't even get me started on whitewashing THEIR OWN characters. kaeya in that one music official art, where everyone argued it was ""lighting"" when even if it was lighting, he would still be significantly darker. xinyan in that one chibi official art, where they didn't even try hiding the fact that they took all the melanin out of their skin. also kokomi was already getting trashed on for ""being the worst 5 star"", her trailer didn't do her any justice and didn't show her personality at all, it made it seem like she's stupid and has no experience in war whatsoever.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game on the PC rather than my mobile device (personal reasons) but ultimately it has been a blast. Though, I‚Äôm not a fan of throwing money at a game for characters (I know this is optional, but fishing for characters is getting old). 

Even still, I understand many individuals can farm the game for the in-game currency and still achieve in obtaining characters but I feel there should be a free-give first tier character give away. As a casual, wanting to have the new characters but not wanting to put the time into farming and definitely not having the money dip for them it is somewhat dissuasive.

Then again, economical generation can be produced by unique skins or perhaps unique weapons. There are a few games that do this already, and they seem fine.

I understand you guys are having a rough patch at the time of this review, but do endure and learn for the experience.",5
"This is the best you‚Äôll find on mobile. The story is intense sometimes and it‚Äôs really satisfying to be able to go ANYWHERE on the map (that‚Äôs released). The characters are lovable and you can do deep story quests for primogems and lore. 

The people complaining about the anniversary awards are so immature and need jesus. You already get this great game and 1600 primogems worth of wishes but you still complain and leave a bad review for no reason. This is a company and what theyre doing is already great enough. Do you really expect a FrEE FiVe sTar AnD 90 pUlLs each year??",5
"I am writing this review in the midst of the first anniversary uproar. The developer is making a strong effort to recruit new players with multiple hashtag icons on Twitter and numerous paid advertisements on different platforms, but all they are offering to the players who have supported this game for a year is ten free wishes. This ‚Äúreward‚Äù is a pittance, especially when they gave more generous rewards for the Lantern Rite Festival event. They give more generous rewards in the other two primary games they are running. Where is the motivation for older players to continue to support the game? Where is the effort to retain older supporters? I spent money on this game, and I don‚Äôt feel like they care. All they want are more users. They don‚Äôt care about the ones they already have.",1
"This game is SOOOOOOO stingy with their rewards. They have about 30+ MILLION active players and for the anniversary they give us 3k mora and 100 primogems. Those aren‚Äôt even enough for a SINGLE WISH. The players give mihoyo free advertisement, cosplaying, promotions, etc‚Ä¶ and get virtually NOTHING in return. If you want a good game similar to this one, I recommend Cookie Run. They give you so many free gems and you‚Äôre able to get so many new characters just from logging in for a day. Genshin impact is by far one of the worst if not THE worst game I‚Äôve ever played in the apple store. Mihoyo made over 3 MILLION DOLLARS in Ei‚Äôs banner ALONE, yet they STILL refuse to give us at least at free 10 pull? It wouldn‚Äôt cost mihoyo ANYTHING to give the players a free ten pull or 5* character. Genshin impact is the WORST STINGY GAME EVER. DO NOT PLAY IT.",1
"All gacha games are predatory by nature but this one takes the cake. When compared to other gacha games, the in game currency is expensive and does not go nearly as far. This game is also no where near as generous for holidays and events as others despite their profits.  Overall, this aspect is extremely disappointing but is not the only reason for the 1 star. 

The game started out with a strong and interesting plot and characters that somewhat made up for the gacha aspect but their recent content is rushed at best and full of holes. The new characters are shallow and lack any sort of rich or really any back story unlike earlier characters. It leaves you wondering what exactly happened at the company to see such a drastic change in quality.",1
I first started playing this game in console which in console the graphics look stunning and the game was amazing. The story is very amazing and so genius. As you keep playing it gets better and better. The only thing that would make this game is adding co-op but that‚Äôs literally all. Everything else in the game is awesome and this is one of my favorite games. I hope that the creators would one day get a million dollar donation for their great effort trying to help others. I wish you and the creators the best of luck!,5
But one problem i have is that the stamina ends too quickly and if you run out of stamina while swimming in real life its not like you‚Äôre gonna drown and if you are climbing a mountain in real life it doesn't matters if your fingers hurt or you are thirsty you are not gonna let go unless you are weak but if i am going to drown in real life because of low stamina i would just lay back in the water and float it feels the same as being in a water bed well those are my only stuff even do i know you can get more stamina by worshipping the statue of the seven but good game.,4
"This game is by far the best ones i have played, everything is beautiful and u can roam around freely in the game, it‚Äôs an AMAZING rpg combat game, so many things to do, and u get ADDICTED to it, i started playing in February and i there hasn‚Äôt been a day where i haven‚Äôt played genshin since then, the game is amazing and even makes u tear up sometimes by certain story quests, this game is truly splendid, and even if ur bored there‚Äôs always something to do in the game like, fight bosses, play with friends, do quests, etc. Truly and Splendid and well done game!",5
"Dear Mihoyo, I love all of ur apps and games truly! Genshin is my favourite but, I seem to have run into a bit of an issue. I am a us player who accidentally chose the Asia server‚Ä¶all has been well and good until the 2.0 update when everything went down hill quickly. Now every time I come to do anything in the app it Immediately lags me out. Please find a way to solve this issue by either allowing me to keep the in game progress while switching to another server. Or by stopping the game from lagging me out! Tysmmm!",5
"This is a beautiful game and I love playing it, but the drop rates in this game are terrible. I understand that it‚Äôs a Gacha game, but there is no incentive to pay into the gacha system with this game. I play others that reward you for your time and money (Bleach Brave Souls: amazing drops rates & great in-game package deals - rewards you for your time and money) and (Exos Heroes: average drop rates but easy to accumulate crystals for summons - rewards you for your time) This game does not reward you for the time and money that you pour into it. It‚Äôs a great game but, it could be so much better if the drop rates were improved or there were better purchasing options.",3
"So I‚Äôve grown up playing a video game called Zelda and well I‚Äôve kinda grown on the game, and as somone who plays games like genshin impact I have no problem with them, but I‚Äôve seen that a part of the genshin impact community compared Zelda and their game, and as somone who grew up around Zelda and hear that people hated on it because of a comparison, I was really sad but instead of hating on genshin impact which took a lot of effort. I‚Äôve decided to try and play even tho no one might see this review I‚Äôm just glad I got enough courage to play it :)",5
"Mihoyo please if your reading this, the game is great and all but there‚Äôs like way to many game glitched for me. Like the tri seal quest. I‚Äôm trying to peacefully complete it but there was an interruption. One of the tribe elemental things have already been 
 touched and I‚Äôm certain have never been to that spot. So now every if is screwed and I can never complete the quest. :/

this probably is a very personal problem but just wanted to put it out there. Dunno if this only happens to mobile players or what? Just me? :/",5
"This game is the best game ever. It‚Äôs really addicting and all, the characters and plot are amazing. There‚Äôs only one problem for me though. I use iPad to play but it glitches and kicks me out all the time when I try fixing part setup, teleporting to mondstat, checking the battle pass, or checking my characters (to level up/change weapons etc). I hope you can fix this bug! Not to mention whenever there‚Äôs a story it really lags, i hope you can fix that as well. Other than that, the game is chef‚Äôs kiss.",5
"This game is my new favorite game, myself only playing it for about thirty minutes at first, and has the most advanced storyline I have ever seen. Every new quest I find out something new and I love it. Even though I still have much to learn about this game, it is no doubt the most impressive, decisive game I have ever played. The graphics are awesome, the smoothness of mobile play, the STORYLINE (it is awesome), OVERALL detail to everything! There is just so many things you can do in this game. One other thing is the map! IT IS HUGE! 
This is one of the best games I have ever played.",5
"There‚Äôs a lot of good things about this game, like the graphics and score. But one thing that most people do not like (excluding me) is the gatcha system. A lot of people say that the rates for 5-stars are way too low at 0.6%. But I personally think that the 0.6 percent is fine because the 5-stars are insanely good and if everyone had them, it take the thrill out of pulling characters. One last thing before I go... Please put Ayaka on standard banner when she comes out. I have like 50 Intertwined fates plus 29k primos saved up for her. F2P btw.",5
"This game is revolutionary for mobile gaming. Ive been able to get characters up to level 70/90 and have over 150 hours of gameplay from this game that only has 2/7 full areas in the game so far, without spending a dime. It‚Äôs incredible, and the feedback system is actually valuable and the company has made changes when many people ask. I hope they stay this way and are mindful about opening new regions while being culturally sensitive and open to feedback. I wish to play this game for a long time.",5
"SO GOOD!! Such a well made rpg, the graphics are INSANE for a mobile game. totally succeeded my expectations. I love all the characters, and I find the storyline REALLY INTERESTING. The whole world is beautiful, there‚Äôs so much to explore! I do have a complaint tho, i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my phone or if it‚Äôs a universal problem. When i try teleporting, it kicks me out the app. Not all the time, but it‚Äôs happened more times than i‚Äôd like to admit. Other than that, i‚Äôve had no problems! This game is super fun and keeps you hooked the entire time. Totally recommend if you like magical open world games!",5
"So, this game looks amazing and I really want to play it. I can excuse the elephant in the room (BotW rip-off much?), because the game would be amazing. If I could play it. Why on earth is this even in the AppStore?! The info says the game is only 2.6 GB (already kinda big), but it‚Äôs not. Once you download the app and make an account, you have to download the rest of the game from within the app. I looked it up, and the game takes up 30 GB !!!!!!!! That‚Äôs almost twice the amount of storage my phone would have if genshin impact was the only data on it PERIOD. My phone has a total of 16GB. Why would you say on the AppStore that it is compatible with iPhone 6 if it‚Äôs not?! I would definitely give this five stars if I could actually play it.",2
"So the first time I downloaded Genshin Impact it told me that there was a insufficient storage error, and that would pop up every time I tapped to begin. I eventually deleted the game and reinstalled it. The second time it says that the connection timed out, and many downloads later nothing is changing. I tried to look up the solutions for both of the errors but could only find the answer for the insufficient storage error. It says to go to settings, go to storage, click Genshin Impact, and tap clear cache and data. I don‚Äôt have a cache and data button so I don‚Äôt know what to do.",4
"When I first began playing Genshin Impact, it was amazing. Everything was a new experience. The character designs were lovely, and everywhere I looked I saw breathtaking scenery. The storyline was engaging, and I enjoyed interacting with characters. However, a couple of months after playing Genshin Impact, I began to get bored of the game. Logging on every day felt more like a chore, rather than a relaxing escapism from the real world. As you progress further in the game there is a larger need to grind for materials and characters. However, it is still a solid game, and I recommend playing it.",4
Have been emailing them back and forth regarding my account which got hacked. Dont even know how it got hacked my account was mine and was not bought or rerolled. Spent quite a bit of money on the game as well. Its frustrating reaching AR 39 almost 40 and your friends saying my account has been online and i cant access it. Mihoyo fix your dam support. We need replies faster especially since my account had alot of primo gems on it prepping for klee and it gets hacked right after. Seriously i‚Äôve sent you guys countless emails. When i get my account back i‚Äôll change my review but honestly when you use real money in the game i dont understand why they dont have a proper support team to handle these things or even a phone number for customer support or something.,1
"Genshin Impact is a fun game for sure and that is why I‚Äôve rated it at five stars although I did want to give it a four and a half star rating but that‚Äôs not possible. Why? Well as the topic subject of my review states ‚Äúcontroller support,‚Äù I feel like that‚Äôs one of the major things GI is lacking and keeping it from being an even more amazing game. The on screen buttons are cool and all but they‚Äôre not all that intuitive. Hopefully Devs you all will really consider this feature and implement it to GI. I mean Honkai Impact has it right? So I‚Äôm thinking y‚Äôall can do the same for GI. Thanks for an awesome game!",5
"Man I went into this game being super hesitant about playing a new game, as I mostly stick to league of legends, but I was surprised how quickly I picked Genshin impact up and how fun it was! I love the open world design/BOTW aspect the game brings to the table, I‚Äôve never heard of the game until my friend told me about it last week, now I‚Äôm addicted. I play on PC/mobile when I‚Äôm away, I love the F2P aspect of the game so I‚Äôm not spending tons of real money on the game to enjoy it myself. The ONLY issue I have is with mobile not currently having controller support, that would bring this 5/5 to a 10/5",5
"Love that it‚Äôs available on all platforms, but I would hace given 5 stars if the hellspawn Paimon didn‚Äôt exist. She just ruins every conversation in every cut-scene, uncontrolibly saying the worst things you could possibly say to people. She got so annoying one time that it convinced me to write this review.

The traveler could have just done most of the talking in the story, and Paimon could have just played supoorting character, but in this case, shes basically an interpreter; and she even has more voice over than the main character themself.",5
"The graphics are flawless even if you get it on mobile! I adore the storyline, characters, quests etc. I noticed some people have been complaining it has been laggy on their mobile device, but it depends on internet and how good your phone or iPad is. The only thing I have against the game is how long it takes you to level up. I spent an hour trying to get to level 24-25, and getting the teleport things is definitely draining. Other than that I would definitely recommend!",5
"So far, Genshin Impact has been a masterpiece of a game. It‚Äôs been amazing. The score and art are beautiful, and the gameplay and attention to detail are amazing. You even included motion blur! The game is *not* a Breath of the Wild clone, despite what people have been saying. It reminds me of Breath of the Wild, yes, but it also reminds me of The Elder Scrolls: Blades and anime. (Between you and me, though, the cooking mechanic is a lot better and more fun in this than it is in Breath of the Wild.) So far, I‚Äôve enjoyed this game a lot, and I like all of the mechanics. (Cryo freezing the rivers is one of my favorites, though. [super useful for preserving stamina!])",5
"I‚Äôve been searching for games like Genshin for a very long time. I‚Äôve played a variety of mmo/dungeon crawler, but i‚Äôve gotten bored due to styles that didn‚Äôt fit my expectations especially on the mobile. When I discovered Genshin, I was amazed of how amazing these graphics were and how much potential it can have. With crossplay, and party mmo, i feel like this game can become something bigger than it is if they play their cards right. If they listen to the community and continue to update and fix bugs, I could see this game with a huge community!",5
"1. It called itself a open world game. But you cannot proceed the storyline until you reach certain adventure level.
2. You can only find junks in the chest around the map. Because all good weapons and characters are in the pool.
3. Stupid pooling chance. Characters and weapons are in the same pool. 0.6% chance for 5 star characters and 5 star weapon. 1.6% chance for 4 star characters and 4 star weapon. 
4. Expensive in game purchase. It took you approximately 20 dollars for 10 draws. 4 star is Guaranteed every 10 draws. It can be characters and weapon. 5 star is guaranteed every 90 draws. But with my experience, the chance you spend 100 dollars on the pool, there will be 99% of chance of drawing a weapon.
5. Hollow world. Once you reached adventure level 29, there is no more main story. All left in the game is grinding for gears.
6. You can only farm 6 dungeons per day if you do not use your dollar. Running 6 dungeons will take you about 8 mins. And you have 4 daily quest per day taking you 10 mins. And that‚Äôs all. Nothing else for you to play. All you can do is go offline and enjoy your normal life.
7. Summary. It‚Äôs A game will just waste your time.",1
"Okay Genshin is an enjoyable game. There‚Äôs much you can do at the start, but once you reach the higher adventure ranks it gets easier to understand the creators of Genshin impact are really cheap. For example the newest regions like Inazuma or sumeru don‚Äôt offer as much primos for exploration as they did in Mondstat and Liyue. Genshin also needs to understand that quests should give more primos per quest. If genshin wants to add 12 hour quest then give us 5 wishes or something. Okay and don‚Äôt even get me started on how much storage this app takes to run. Even with many flaws this is a good game for the gays.",4
"First this is an amazing game. My minor complain is buff timers, example when a character gets a shield or attack buff, there is no way to tell how much left. Usually there is a visual effect but it‚Äôs so settle especially when you in battle, you won‚Äôt be able to easily tell what buff you have left on your main DPS. Simple fix yet to see that. Ideally I would like to see it as an option in the settings. Also story line PLZZZ make it shorter conversations and MUCH MUCH MORE straight to the point. Thx!",5
"Okay, hear me out, really good game, love the graphics, but why do we have to download the full game? Some of us don‚Äôt have that space, we already go through a good 6-7 hours of downloading the game in general, so why do we have to download the full game? That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, and it makes me angry that I have to do that because I certainly don‚Äôt have enough space. I can only play the demo‚Ä¶. üò≠ I wanna be able to get the full game without downloading the full game‚Ä¶ 

Please fix this, make it so we don‚Äôt have to download to get the full game‚Ä¶",4
"I‚Äôve had this game for almost a year and I‚Äôm obsessed with it. I love the creative RPG and boss fights. I‚Äôve noticed it gets quite glitchy when playing with others. The best part is (unlike fortnite) You can get all of the characters for free. All of their weapons for free. No money needs to be spent unless you would like a special character outfit (which has no benefits) other than that, fantastic. It‚Äôs my favorite although it takes up 20 GB for me, but i‚Äôve been playing for a very long time",5
I have been playing this game for a few months now and I haven‚Äôt had any problems until recently. I saw someone else that said that they had the same problems in the ratings. I was forcefully logged out of my account and when I tried to log back in I had to start a whole new game. I have spent money on this app and you are going to tell me that I did it for nothing. There was no point. If it‚Äôs not fixed I can promise I will not be opening this app again. Because what is the point of playing and making progress in leveling and characters if I am just going to have to start over again. I was very disappointed. My money was wasted and I was making a lot of progress on my main character.,1
"A lot of glitches, I am AR 35 and I am supposed to be AR 36 by now but my game doesn‚Äôt let me, another glitch happened in inazuma I needed to cook pizza for Ayaka when I cooked it I could give it to her it didn‚Äôt show the submit button, it‚Äôs really important because I need to be AR 36 to finish one quest and I can‚Äôt also I can‚Äôt finish the inazuma quest I tried everything it didn‚Äôt work but in total the game is fire really good just pls fix the glitch, also if anyone knows where to ask for help pls tell me",5
"I got really into this game! It‚Äôs really fun and inspired me a lot! Until now I still continue to play. Why? The graphics are good, the story plot the ART, EVERYTHING! I really love all the character designs and all the puzzle quests make my brain hurt, but it‚Äôs still worth playing! The best part is, that the app is free!!!(unless your lazy and don‚Äôt wanna get primos) 
The only thing that makes things difficult is the app size ;-; 
The app is so big I have to get rid of so many things hehe. Buuuuuut, I decided it‚Äôs worth it once again :D
Thanks for reading!",5
"The touch d-pad has a fixed position which is an awful decision. I used to play Diablo immortal and it has perfect natural movement  controls, I just don‚Äôt need a game pad at all with it. genshin Impact is just unplayable, I always move back instead of moving forward. I deleted the game because of that at the game release. I decided to give it another try several years later, same awful controls... deleting again. Why they can‚Äôt make the virtual dpad work as camera controls. Just divide the screen on 2 half‚Äôs the left half is for movement, the right is for the camera.  Now the camera takes the space even above the virtual joystick, so if I miss it I control the camera by the Left thumb. Awful.",1
"as a new player i loved and connected with a lot of characters physical appearance . but with more characters coming out ( which all look amazing and i love the thought behind each design ) i just hope some diversity when it comes to SKIN TONES comes around . I rlly lack a lot of connection due to the shades of skintones of all these characters and it offends me due to our only brown skinned female character ‚Äú Xinyan ‚Äú being a stereotyped amongst darker skinned women ( loud, outcasted and etc ) i really hope for the best of this game to bring some diversity amongst different regions and such . Since you guys are inspired by such games like legend of zelda breath of the wild, i would hope to see diversity in cultures, skin tones and cultural backgrounds like breath of the wild :}",1
"the outlook for the sumeru characters is not great. aside from the fact that it‚Äôs already a melting pot of SWANA cultures, the designs are made with no regard for the actual cultures being used in the first place and every single character is pale. what, scared of some melanin? it‚Äôs been annoying enough watching official art of kaeya and xinyan being made pale, now an entire nation that has the chance to be some sort of representation in genshin impact has no characters with darker skin. the colorism has got to stop, this is exhausting. and it makes all the characters look the same, it doesn‚Äôt matter how elaborate you get with the clothes and hair if the skin is just shades of white every single time. we‚Äôve seen the effort put into the characters and nations. do better.",1
I honestly seen so many good reviews but this just makes me sick as a mobile player. I first started playing this game on mobile but I had to delete so many of my other apps for this game to work. I loved it when I started playing but because I was on mobile it constantly kicked me out of the game. It was getting really annoying so I deleted it and started playing on pc and the quality was so much better. I recommend not playing it on mobile because of how much storage it takes up but overall a great game.,4
"The start of the game was amazing! The cutscenes and the handsome/beautiful characters are amazing! The grinding of this game just makes you obsessed over the game and honestly I stayed of over 1AM just to play it and grind. I‚Äôve had a BLAST playing this!!!! And the story line and the plot all like fold in together, but‚Ä¶ I did kinda hate how my cutscenes would glitch but I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just because the device I play (IOS) but I don‚Äôt know it could just be that my iPad couldn‚Äôt handle it? But either way this game is the best! Recommend ‚úîÔ∏è",5
"So this game is absolutely amazing and it is free! It‚Äôs is the only good free open world mobile game that I have come across. However, because of how much content it has, it can be hard for older and lower storage devices to handle. Currently I have been playing for a bit over a year and IT NOW TAKES UP 23 GB OF SPACE ON MY PHONE!  I mostly play on my phone which is new and it runs great, but it isn‚Äôt the same for my older iPad. Even at the lowest possible graphics setting it will sometimes crash if I click too many buttons at once or if I open a menu right after switching characters.",3
So I‚Äôm only 2 hours into this game and there is so much to take in. I wish these free to play games didn‚Äôt have sooooo much crap to go through. Just make it simple. I am learning now more about the game and it‚Äôs getting easier. The graphics are great for a mobile game. This would be even better if it was a paid game not a free to play with iap. Like a monthly subscription cost or something. I‚Äôm very much enjoying this game and plan on playing it for the foreseeable future. Looking forward to the new update. Is it really that important to get the right character?,4
"I love Genshin, I‚Äôve only been playing for a couple of months but I‚Äôm in love with this game, it‚Äôs so fun and has great storylines, maps, characters, and much more. Im also really excited for upcoming banners like Yelan and Dansleif and other reruns. I also like how unique the characters are and their attacks, and I think it‚Äôs very unique on how you can build characters and the whole game in general is very different from all the other games and that‚Äôs what makes it fun. I‚Äôm really excited on future updates and hope your guys stay safe!",5
"Pretty good game, my only problem is that it‚Äôs a hassle meeting the requirements to play the game and it would be much easier if it was ported to the switch. Not to mention some of the main plot gets a bit convoluted. However you don‚Äôt need to spend money to get the characters you want. All those low star reviews talking about sinking money into the wish system are completely unnecessary. You can get more than enough primo gems by just playing the game. I know. Imagine that right? All in all stunningly pretty and fun game.",4
"I just love Genshin, it‚Äôs my favorite game of all time. I‚Äôm usually a PC player and it runs really nice. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not always at home and when I have Welkin activated (I‚Äôm a low spender account) I tend to miss a lot of it, so I got it on mobile! The only problem is that now, with 2.3 out, I can‚Äôt play anymore because my IPad doesn‚Äôt have enough storage to get the update. Genshin takes up a little under half my storage, and it makes me sad that I can‚Äôt collect my daily things while not at my PC.",5
"I love this game so much and I play almost everyday but I would love to play on my macbook! You can‚Äôt play on your macbook unless you boot camp it to windows 10, I would love for it to be available on macbook without having to boot camp it. Besides that I love the game, I play with my friends and I love all the quests. The characters are amazing!

Edit: The anniversary rewards aren‚Äôt even that bad, we get a whole event that gives us a bunch of primos and 10 free wishes for logging in along with 4 gifts we will be getting in our mailboxes.",5
I love this game. I wish I had a video game console because I imagine it‚Äôs even more beautiful to play. Unfortunately the iOS version is super glitchy. It will INEVITABLY crash at some point by clicking on the map or menu items. It also sometimes randomly crashes. Also there is no enjoyment to be had from the video sequences. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs iOS or whatever but the video and audio skips the entire time. You can‚Äôt make sense of anything. The game also lags occasionally but honestly I‚Äôd be over the moon if they could just stop the game from crashing. Happens once every 5-10 minutes or so.,3
"Anniversary rewards was a disgrace. You have only a chance to earn anything and even if you win out of the millions of participants, it‚Äôs barely anything. Now, they are releasing more amazing rewards! Of course it‚Äôs a competition or challenge such as following their account to advertise for them. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still playing‚Ä¶ I am just waiting for ganyu but without a roadmap, it looks like I might move on before then. Lost many players, Mihoyo‚Ä¶ just listen a little or at least fix some of the glitches or weaknesses of characters and definitely boost our rewards. You‚Äôve earned billions and have given back less than a drop of our money",2
"I have been playing this game for only about 4-5 months, and I‚Äôm addicted. The game is so good and there are so many different characters to chose from. I also am happy that miHoYo listened to the community and gave more rewards, thank you miHoYo. I can play this for hours, it‚Äôs so fun being able to collect primogems and being able to wish to get new characters. The actual plot line is also very interesting to me too. I appreciate that they have settings to change the graphics level.",5
"This game really brings a new horizon to the mobile gaming genre. Open world games with lots of places to explore. Really enriched story line. And totally new and different mechanism and gameplay. Only problem is the resin limitation. After reaching a certain point the game becomes boring because of resin limitations. You can only play 30-60 mins a day after a certain adventure rank. They really need to fix this resin problem. Otherwise it‚Äôs really hard to enjoy the game, if you are not so lucky in the gacha system.",5
My sister and friends played this game for a while and recommended it to me because I lived Fable 3. I wasn‚Äôt sure about playing it on my phone so I got it for my PS4. I love it a lot. There is mix of so many elements from all kinds of games and it is fun every time you get a new character or weapon. I found myself playing on breaks at work and whenever I have a spare moment. I am hoping it comes out on Switch soon because playing on my phone is a little challenging because of battery life etc. Reccommend it!,5
"The game itself is great. Fantastic world setting, lots of interesting characters and great for anyone that loves exploring. However, the company is awful to the playerbase. Very greedy practices even for a gacha game. The 1st anniversary has started, and they haven‚Äôt even given us a simple letter in the mail thanking us for the time and support we‚Äôve given them. miHoYo used to at least do the bare minimum to keep the players informed, but recently they‚Äôve gone pretty much radio silent and don‚Äôt respond to anything. Play the game if you like open world RPGs, but don‚Äôt expect anything in return gor your time or else you‚Äôll be very disappointed.",3
"Genshin Impact has been an addicting game to me for the past few months. I play on mobile, and there‚Äôs one thing that just stresses me out. Redeeming codes. I went to the Genshin Impact website, and it said I hadn‚Äôt created a character even though I did! I tried it in the game and it didn‚Äôt show up even though I am above Adventure Rank 10. This is something that bothers me, and most of the time I would report more things, but I have nothing else to say. That tells you that Genshin Impact is a great game.",5
I personally love this game! I was lucky enough to have enough storage for it and I‚Äôm still a new player but honestly this game has amazing graphics and it honestly really fun!! Got it recommended by a friend and Instagram! I love the character design and basically everything about it! Everything is so beautiful and well made! I can wait to keep playing and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for this great game! The community is amazing as well! Kudos to all the amazing people who worked hard on this very poggers game<3,5
"I really love genshin impact and also the characters. It‚Äôs a really fun game and lots of fun missons to do. I really love how you can fight different species. The characters have very nice powers especially Lisa and Kaeya . This game is my comfort game and I love it a lot ! I really hope my friends download it and play with me. I think they would really love it üíïüíï , I really wished I found out about this game sooner so I could have got venti and some other things but that‚Äôs okay ! I really hope the creator of this game is very happy to see their game blow up and lots of people loving it üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíó",5
"If you are looking for a game full of adventure and stories you‚Äôve come to the right place. This game is amazing! I fully recommend. It is full of stories, adventure, and mystery. It‚Äôs got great graphics and not to mention the music is just upright amazing. Even the battle music. When I first came across this game I was thinking this is so fake so I kind of ignored it. Then a friend recommended it to me so i tried it out and I didn‚Äôt regret a thing. Thank you for such an amazing game! Although downloading it is a pain it is worth it. :)",5
"I do not even know where to start! I only just started playing a day or two ago, and I am already hooked on this amazing mystical world. 
Genshin Impact truly is one for the books.

   You start your journey in a new world with your faithful traveling companion, Paimon. Together you get to explore the immense world. The storyline is greatly written, and the quests are challenging and fun to play! You could roam the world and not play any of the quests, and still have tons of fun. While I‚Äôm only 
so far into the game, and have not discovered everything, I cannot wait to keep playing and see what is in store for this game.

   I see very little ways the game could be improved, the one main thing I can think of is do not quit on this game. Keep adding content, maybe expand the map, and make sure to add new adventures and quests for players to keep enjoying. Keep up the good work!",5
"ok i have genshin on my ipad and im writing this from my phone but anyways this game is a MASTERPIECE. sure it may be similar to BOTW but it definitely aint a copy. also hu tao is just ADORABLE. but i have 2 complaints:

1. ridiculous stats on artifacts
ok so today i was doing the wuwang hill pyro artifact domain and ofc for the award i got a pyro artifact. but the main stat was a hydro dmg bonus- like, ik stats are randomized but a hydro dmg bonus on a PYRO artifact is just hilarious 

2. gacha
ok so gacha is my second fave part of this game besides exploring. but the thing is five stars (like diluc, keqing,mona, etc.) are almost IMPOSSIBLE to get. well, hu tao is an exception but the others nah mate- i suggest to make the rates a little higher. and also if someone already has a c6 chrctr they shouldn‚Äôt be able to be pulled anymore.

ok! thats all! i love this game and if youre just checking out reviews before downloading i EXTREMELY recommend downloading this game! its epic and very exciting! ok, thanks for reading! :)",5
"Its a cool game with a nice storyline, even tho I think they should show more dark skin representation, its a pretty good game. I love the graphics and the characters. The game is honestly amazing and fun, but once you start to get into the higher ranks it starts to get a bit more boring, like you‚Äôve already done everything. But, it fun getting to play with other people within your server in co-op, and having them help you, or you help them with bosses, domains or quests. But thank you so much for giving me Scara even tho I won my 50/50 like 3 times before I would've cried if I didnt get him.. üò≠",4
"This game felt like playing a slightly jankier version of Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. There‚Äôs a big difference between having similar ideas, or taking inspiration from something, and directly stealing the entire look and feel of that thing. 

There are in-app purchases on this, so while the game is free to download, money is still being made off of this copy. I honestly couldn‚Äôt play anymore because the similarities became so blatant it was jarring. Fire causing an air updraft for you to be able to ride your ‚Äòtotally original air-glider‚Äô on was the last straw for me, I believe. Honestly surprised Nintendo hasn‚Äôt attempted a lawsuit on this one yet. 

In short, the game looks and feels like a B-list Breath of the Wild... I really wanted to enjoy this game as well, as there really aren‚Äôt many good games on mobile.",1
"I love this game so far, the details, the stunning scenery, solid storyline, and good fighting system is amazing, I have a problem where the game would lag on the cutscenes or kick me out on random times, I would highly encouraged a free wish every day, because it‚Äôs hard as a f2p player to get the characters you want from wishes or can increase the amount of priogems, hi I‚Äôm back I still love the game but for the love of god why does the game always kick me out when I‚Äôm using the teleport waypoint to mondstant or liyue it‚Äôs annoying plz fix this",5
"It‚Äôs honestly such a beautiful game, with so many voice actors that I can immediately recognize from other dubbed anime. It has so much content and so many characters that it‚Äôs hard to get bored with. I don‚Äôt entirely know why there‚Äôs some hate around this game, Personally, I‚Äôm excited to see where this game goes.

Side note: it would be nice if I could change the app icon to a guy or something that doesn‚Äôt immediately make my friends think I play a hentai game. I know it doesn't inherently look like such, I just get a lot of comments from anybody who sees it.",5
"This is absolutely one of the best free-to-play games I‚Äôve ever encountered. The gameplay is massive, the soundtrack is a masterpiece *chef‚Äôs kiss*, stunning art and impressive voice acting especially JP ver. It‚Äôs so addictive and don‚Äôt get me started with the gacha. I was lucky enough to roll Diluc on my first try and that‚Äôs pretty much it for my luck. People might really have to control their spending otherwise they will go broke. I hope that mihoyo would add an option to dress up the characters. We can get outfits from either missions or the gacha. But, here‚Äôs your five stars mihoyo, y‚Äôall know what‚Äôs up.",5
"Hey. I never find the time to write reviews usually, but I feel like this game is just so amazing. It‚Äôs qualities, music, and everything about it is so charming to me. Today was actually my birthday, and they even sent me a little something, so thank you for that. I really do recommend this game to people who really like BOTW. It‚Äôs just so much fun, and you can do so many things. I was one of the people who pre-ordered the game and I do not regret a single bit of playing this game. The graphics are just as stunning, and it‚Äôs just amazing. Try it out yourself :)",5
"Great graphics, good story, good designs, creativity wise beautiful absolutely amazing. However much of the content as you get further into the game turns into a cycle of grinding with a terrible resin system. Although I understand most mobile games aren‚Äôt meant to be played for more than an hour or so this is a big game that doesn‚Äôt even work with many mobile devices and is accessible on computers and gaming consoles which are usually more fit to actually have the game installed please fix the resin system and add more content for higher levels so that we can continue being in love with this game and not just do our daily commissions for 30 minutes at ar 30.",3
"Initially game showed white/black screen and crashed. Solution: slide up, take off screen orientation lock, turn phone in orientation sideways, launch game. 

The frame rate is smooth so far, and no crashes. Battery drains quickly however (brand new battery) on my iPhone 7 Plus. 

Awesome game. I truly dislike the high-pitch anime voices, but that‚Äôs a personal preference, and the voice acting itself is very high quality. Graphics are fantastic and gameplay seems highly developed and of outstanding quality.",5
"Genshin Impact is definitely my favorite game! Amazing graphics, pretty characters, cool storylines.. But I really do think they need to work on their representation! They're pretty ignorant when it comes to culture. If the regions are based off of real places and in some cases people, I don't see why you can't represent them correctly? I do absolutely love this game, and I'm aware that there are other things to worry about than fictional characters' skin tones, but I'm positive I'm not alone when I say that they should represent cultures and places more accurately and show more diversity.",4
"TikTok, you don‚Äôt even do anything to the accounts that are actually bad and violate things. But you ban innocent accounts and remove perfectly fine videos. I love this app but not how you manage it. I had found a gacha haters account and reported it because it was toxic to the community and you did NOTHING. That just shows how messed up you are. You banned my best friend for NOTHING. When people report bad things you do nothing but when someone did absolutely nothing and like ONE hater reports them, you ban the creator. And you say you look over it when you probably don‚Äôt or you probably just see if you like it or not, if you don‚Äôt like it but it‚Äôs perfectly fine you ban it. I hate you TikTok.",1
"I love this game, and so do all my friends. The only thing that could be better is the prices! Hah. It‚Äôs like a playable anime. Everything is so beautiful, to the maps, to the entities, to the detail, to the characters. It‚Äôs quite easy to understand, and it‚Äôs great that it gives you challenges, and that you can find strategies to improve your experience, this is the best game I have ever played- besides Minecraft. I like to play music while listening to this and just vibe, but it is also fun to just explore the areas.",5
"Hello! I recently downloaded Genshin impact afte reading the amazing reviews and my friends telling me it‚Äôs really fun. I have no problem downloading it and I cleared some storage space in the process, and I registered with no issue, but when I tried to log in with my correct sign in information it says ‚Äòpoor quality of network‚Äô even though my wifi is full bars. I also deleted then redos loaded the game, and shut off my tablet and turned it back on. It still won‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug, but could you please find out what‚Äôs wrong? Thanks!",4
"I absolutely love this game, it is extremely addicting, and there is so much too explore!  
The characters of this game are well designed, and put together. And the worlds are just magnificent, but I hate that you can‚Äôt be in friends worlds, and stuff while you are taking a break from a quest. And every activity is timed which can be extremely frustrating and difficult, along with the ascending adventure rank quests. But besides that I think this company is doing a great job with their work! Good Job!üëèüèª",5
So I brought some wishes but they never came so I would like my 30 wishes to be here by tomorrow or I will not play or review good please fix this for me I need to get yefei or whatever her name is thank you and please your app is very good but I want my 30 wishes on my account is cupcakeshymia or Game Center‚Äô is violetcold my cousin picked my name is so funny bye and thank you when I get my stuff I will leave a better review and will thank the app for this blessing you or a great person so I‚Äôm hoping you can fix this or I want my money back is really important I have saved that for this and your so great and good so I wish the  for god to make you have a blessed day and god loves you and everybody your so nice thank you and bye!!!,2
"I love this game but I couldn‚Äôt play it because it need a lot of space so I cleared out some space and it did work.
 But every time I had to download a new update I had to erase another app at the same time.
I had to delete almost every app in my iPad to play and I did it because it is such an awesome game but when I did it, it didn‚Äôt let me in it sead you have to much space in the iPad or something like that when I only had like 4 apps in my iPad and to this point I won‚Äôt be able to play.",5
"Honestly, this is a very good app to play when your bored. It take‚Äôs a lot of storage but I think it‚Äôs worth it. The people there are kind and it‚Äôs not a issue. You get this main character Lumine or Aether and you have to complete quests around the map and fight. You can wish for more characters to get. From playing the game for about a year it‚Äôs really good. You might get confused playing it in the beginning but you will soon know how to. The problem is that it takes way to many storage.",5
"The recent adjustment to Yae Miko‚Äôs target priority system has had a significant negative effect on her gameplay. The change from random to closest on her targeting has made her C2 nearly useless, with the increased range being meaningless if it will not target farther enemies. If an enemy is immune to electro or shielded the Sesshou Sakura will still target the enemy that is unable to be damaged. This has greatly reduced her damage, flexibility and fun. Personally I and many others used Yae Miko for attacking enemies all across the field, with her taking down the farther enemies, so the active character could focus on the immune, shielded or more threatening enemies, rather than being distracted by the support enemies, such as samachurls.",2
"I love the game don‚Äôt get me wrong,the story is well put,graphics are great(heats up your phone if you play on mobile)My only problem is that I can‚Äôt make any top-ups because of the fact that it‚Äôs restricted to the device that the account is originally made from. It‚Äôs probably for security reasons but I wish this was changed since it‚Äôs irritating when you can‚Äôt do it on the original device if it‚Äôs damage and broken,making it difficult for me as a player",5
"I totally adore Genshin Impact for atleast a year I‚Äôve been wanting to play this game and I finally got to! 10/10 for me, the thing is I‚Äôm stuck on the in the mountains quest for quite a while, I‚Äôm on Adventure rank 45 and I have yet to finish it, Genshin takes up a lot of storage overall, I loved it when it first came out and I wanted to try it. It didn‚Äôt work because of the storage but I don‚Äôt blame the developers for this, but Genshin is definitely one of the best games in the App Store

Sincerely, one of your players",5
"I‚Äôll try to keep this short, love the game I‚Äôve played for about 250 days but I have some problems. 

1. Aiming a bow on a grid is terrible, I got Ganyu on my 9th day and have been suffering from this aiming system since, it also moves multiple grid spaces no matter how slow and sensitive you are when aiming. Please give us more customization in terms of controls
2. Lag, for the most part I can run high textures and 60fps with no lag but in some places, mainly in Inazuma I can barely run minimum textures and 60fps because of lag.
3. Anniversary 
4. Artifacts, since they are almost completely luck based it would be nice if it cost less resin or none at all, I‚Äôve basically stopped farming artifacts because of my very bad luck.

If you fix these things I‚Äôll probably play for years to come so please listen to the community for once and fix some issues.",5
"so i love this game and it‚Äôs definitely one ive been waiting for!! but im gonna get straight to the point about the bug i got, which basically keeps me trapped in my teapot. i went into my teapot to put some furnishings, but after doing that i couldn‚Äôt open anything. such as the map to get back to tevyat, the paimon menu, things like that. im gonna try redownloading the game, but if that doesn‚Äôt work i dunno what to do,, it‚Äôs still an amazing game with a lot of thought put into it, but i really don‚Äôt want my experience to be ruined because im stuck in my teapot :(",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since around December and I‚Äôve honestly really liked the music, graphics, but the rewards this game gives is so horrible. I stopped playing last month because of how bad the rewards are in game, and how they even made the weapon banner good only for people who spend tons of money. And the #1 thing that ruined it all was the anniversary. I was going to continue playing the game since I‚Äôve been waiting for Kokomi to be released, but when I saw the anniversary rewards I immediately stopped. This game has finally been out for a year, and the rewards are a gacha?? No free 5 star, no new outfits, but just a free 10 pull?? and not even considering the online rewards where you GACHA for rewards. You have got to be kidding me.",1
"Hello! This is truly a splendid game to play, I spend all day on it! Though, usually whenever I want to go to the character menu or onto another menu, the game crashes randomly. This doesn't happen very much, such as right when I open the game, though in 1 - 5 mins playing it, I open a random menu, and the game crashes. It's pretty annoying, I also don't have many apps on my device so GB and such isn't the problem. My WIFI is usually alright too.

Please fix this! This is still a very nice game to play, as all the characters are certainly interesting!",4
"To be completely honest this game is amazing, yes there a few glitches in the game but the glitches only add more fun to the game. The story is amazing and same goes for the all around quality. Though there are somethings that needed to be updated its not to seriously I just would like if it was updated, like for an example haveing a higher chance of getting 5 star characters and better quality trees, other then that this game is amazing and i definitely recommend it to people who have good internet and storage.",5
the game is so worth it you gain characters do tasks if you don‚Äôt want you can have the world to your self after getting characters but if you don‚Äôt like them you don‚Äôt have to! The only problem I‚Äôm having with the game is that I can‚Äôt danload the full version even tho I only have 18 pics and 2 games but others don‚Äôt have this problem I think. Can you make the whole game full version for the people who can‚Äôt danload it? Thank you for reading this god bless you,5
I got this game because I saw my friends playing it so I thought I might as well download the game and I‚Äôm sooooo glad I did it‚Äôs the funnest game I‚Äôve ever played fight monsters trying to get 5 star hero‚Äôs and sword and weapons you will not get board of this game it‚Äôs adventurous rewarding fun and has tons of action my personal favorite part of this game is battle in bosses and getting new hero‚Äôs I‚Äôve only been playing this game for about 1 day and I‚Äôve come so far it‚Äôs a fun open world with tons of action I think a lot of people would love this game.,5
Extremely fun game that combines both RPG and gacha elements. Hours of fun alone or with friends! You can assemble your own team of adventures and set out on quests as well as just explore the world of Teyvat. Be warned though that at the end of the day it is a gacha game so unless you put in a decent amount of $$ you most likely won‚Äôt have every character or weapon. If you‚Äôre a collector be prepared to spend since drop rates low even compared to other gacha.  It does have an upside in the pity system.,5
"At first I heard a lot of people talking about Genshin impact I though I‚Äôd try it out. And lemme tell you I was surprised that the game was even free! It‚Äôs such a amazing game. My favorite part is that you can build characters,play with people/friends and it has a variety of updates! New characters new things to do! But I did realize the more you level up the more you won‚Äôt have anything to do but I have no problem with that because I can play with other people. I just love the whole mindset of the game. As the game grows I will always be by its side. P.S wHY IS DRAGONSPINE SO ANNOYING.",5
I love this game! The graphics are amazing and you can adventure everywhere you want in this game! The characters are all unique and the quests are all really interesting. So far I am loving this game and I am so glad my friend introduced me to it. I hope there will be more features to play and more ways to grinds primo gems and other things. The voice acting is incredible and I am seriously in love with it. I love RPG games and if you are looking for a game to be addicted to I highly recommend genshin impact! Big shoutout to everyone that was involved to make this game fantastic.,5
Think game is amazing but it can be very laggy and tend to crash a lot with higher visual quality for people who have a potato pc or an old device like mine. If you lower the graphics the gameplay will be just at that point where it won‚Äôt be annoying enough to crash all the time. This is a gacha game though so if you plan on having a bunch of op drops all the time then you better prepare your wallet but the game is also perfect for free to play players. Try this game out it will not disappoint.,5
I love this game it is very interesting and the characters and story line are so cute my only complaint about the game is on mobile apps it keeps kicking me and my friends out when we try to play the only other thing is do you think it will ever be possible to link a playstation account with your phone account that would be great but other than that the game is perfect and i am excited for the 1.3 update but it would be great if the whole kicking players out problem would be fixed.,5
"So I downloaded this game with super high hopes because it reminded me of a game called The Legend Of Zelda, breath of the wild. I registered with my email and when I pressed start it said I had a insignificant amount of storage space, and I was like, ok I need to delete some games anyways! After multiple tries of deleting and coming back I deleted half of my games still wouldn‚Äôt let me play, all my other apps I actually need, my wifi and storage space isn‚Äôt even that high so I was super confused? Am I doing something wrong? I may be reading this wrong considering I‚Äôm not the best when it comes to storage space or it could just have another meaning.",3
"To start the graphics are just amazing the art style is 10/10 the gameplay is probably no not probably it is the best gameplay I‚Äôve seen in a mobile game, I‚Äôve never played a console game and gotten as much joy out of it as I have this game, and the fact that it is on mobile is just crazy. I really recommend you to try this game it have really my my day to day life more enjoyable.  I hope that the developers will continue to make games in this art style with such a good story.",5
"It‚Äôs my favorite game right now and is unlimited in both creativity and opportunity, the only thing I would change is maybe outfit customization. Like you could be able to receive them as gifts for special occasions or main storyline missions, and be able to buy them or get them as special rewards for events or quests. That would be great! Also it would be amazing if you could sell things you gather at certain stores in the cities and villages or have trading posts of some kind. 
Keep up the good work! Love this game!",5
"I‚Äôve tried to play it but it lags so much and heats up my iPad like crazy....when I get the chance to up grade to another iPad maybe I‚Äôll try it again but pointless to use on a mini 4.

Resent review 
Still unplayable on iPad mini 4....
Come on guys,let‚Äôs fix this already,lags and black background until you get close to something...
It maybe open world but I see nothing but a black background as I move around. Look at the negative reviews, there‚Äôs a lot of us that want to play but can‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs been a month and still no word about fixing the black sky issues and others? It works on newer devices only and that‚Äôs all they care about. Obviously üò°
You need to edit what devices it works on specially if you‚Äôre not willing to make them work on said devices.

Edit 3: so we‚Äôve gone from unplayable to barely playable with the new update? Forgot this game if you don‚Äôt have any of the newer devices , sad,I would love to play this but I‚Äôm done waiting for devs to fix these ongoing issues that other games don‚Äôt have. 
I‚Äôm tried of the long download times only to find it unplayable.",1
"I love this game. Really fun, character designs are great, and voice acting is fantastic. Progression is easy but challenging and all the characters are fun and unique. My only problem is that it crashes way too much. I have never played a single time where it didn‚Äôt crash on me once or twice. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when you almost got a boss down but the game crashes and your health is still down but the boss‚Äôs is now full. I‚Äôm talking to you Eye of the Storm. Great game please fix al these crashes.",5
"The details are something I will never get bored of. Not to mention having a good story and explore while still having quests. Honestly I wish I could give more than just five stars. I dont think I‚Äôll ever find a game with so much flexibility such as this one in which the characters have such cool skills. Some are even adorable and I sometimes forget I‚Äôm in battle, just observing the little animal decoy. Other times I forget I‚Äôm even supposed to do quests as I get caught up in exploring, finding what‚Äôs out there. 

Please keep up the good work cause your amazing!",5
"I got both pros and cons. For pros, It is a great open world rpg with engaging storyline and graphics. There are a lot of choices for team composition and play style. For cons, comparing this to other games I played. The energy system in this game is probably the worst. It cost way too much to run a single dungeon and with max energy. Some fairly easy group content can only be ran three to four times a day. Lacks the perspective of multiplayer because of this. It is extremely hard to get new items and the refresh time is extremely long. The gacha rate is one of the lowest in current gaming market. Overall, I‚Äôm kind of disappointed considered that I spent quite a fortune on this too.",3
"The open world loads itself seamlessly, and a combination of enemies makes for a good challenge of your know-how of the elements and their weaknesses. The lore and character interactions are abundant and meaningful. The gacha system in Genshin Impact is an afterthought. What makes the game more unique than other gachas is the pity currency and how its dupe system improves characters and weapons significantly - not their stats, but their passive abilities, making them much more effective in a combat system that relies on environmental mechanics more than numbers.
One major weakness is the game's lack of free currency, or rather, the amount of Primogems being limited to the world. Genshin Impact can retain more players if there's a login bonus everyday, and not just the 1 week event it's holding right now.",1
Alright here‚Äôs why I only gave it 3 stars. Now I don‚Äôt actually know if this is an error on Apple‚Äôs side or Mihoyo‚Äôs side but I played for 2 days straight just grinding really enjoying how amazing this game is just to log on a few hours later to be told ‚ÄúThird-Party account not yet registered.‚Äù I was using Game Center as my account and I had gotten quite far in the game just to try to play again and pretty much be told my account isn‚Äôt accessible anymore. I‚Äôve talked to the support on their discord server just to get nothing from it. Mihoyo if you actually go through these reports actually consider looking into this because I refuse to restart on a new account for your game.,3
"Hear me out. I really like Genshin Impact a LOT. It has cured a lot of my boredom. BUT, it takes up a lot of storage. (Thats why my rating is 4 star rather than 5.) When I first saw Genshin I heard on how it had great graphics and was fun to play. While both of those are true, on the App Store it says it takes up 3 gb. I thought i had enough for it so i decided to download it. Turns out, the demon is 3 gb. While i heard it was different for different devices, it took up 22 gb. If you have the storage, then definitely download it. Its really fun! The storage part is my only complaint.",4
i would have gave this a 5 star if it wasn‚Äôt for the rep this game needs to be more accurate i don‚Äôt like how all the characters are inaccurate please stop sexualizing kimonos and cultural outfits and please make characters that are plus sized if you can make the npc dark skin overweight then you can do that to the characters xinyan is meant to be blasian isn‚Äôt she?so please make her darker alongside with kaeya candace dehya cyno and please make the characters tanner and please make sumeru characters be tan or dark skin or brown east asians arent plain white so are south asians and black people thats it i hope you understand,4
"Hi developers, I have been playing Genshin for a long time, and it has been so amazing. The characters and graphics are amazing. I love this game so much, I spent lots of money on it. When I had to login again I couldn‚Äôt remember my password, so I reset it. Then I logged in. I was restarted and lost all progress. As I said before I spent lots of money on wishing so this was disappointing. I do not know how to retrieve my account but it would be amazing if you could help with this glitch or refund my wishes. Thank you for your time!",5
"Genshin is an amazing, fun, and addicting game and there is plenty to do, you could explore, fight enemies, decorate your serenetia pot, build characters, and wish for the character as well as weapons, but at the same time luck for some people accounts are HORRIBLE and I know that I have bad luck in general but it's gotten annoying considering I'm AR 51 and have lost every 50/50 and only just a week ago got my first five-star weapon, AND I have horrible luck with the artifacts. What am I suppose to do to get some decent luck?????",5
I got this game about five days ago and it‚Äôs a great game when when it tells me it has a update is makes me wait until the next day which is kinda annoying because I wanted to play but I can‚Äôt be it kicks me out of the game and tells me to wait until tomorrow which again it seems really annoying so u was wondering if you guys could fix that but besides that I love the game that‚Äôs the only thing that really bothers me about the game thank you!,5
"I started playing Genshin a few months ago. I think its a really good game, but it is hard to grind for primogems. Basically, one of the only ways to get primogems is by doing daily commisions. Certain events (like Golden Apple Archipelago) are only available to people above a certain adventure rank. I feel like you should lower the adventure rank requirement so more people can enjoy exclusive content. Also, there are a lot of limited events, which sometimes makes it hard for newer players to understand lore. Besides that, it is a really fun game.",4
"The game is so beautiful. It offers many different things to do, and you get to meet characters that have complex personalities. The plot for this game is better then some actual shows that I watch. 

The new characters they bring out are always so exciting and always have a quest to go along with them. There are characters like Klee and Nahida that are so cute and characters that are serious like Cyno and Xiao. 

I would highly recommend that game to anyone who is willing to step into the amazing world of Teyvat.",5
"First of all, I just want to say this game is everything. Graphics, game mechanics, hostile and non hostile mobs, tons of interaction, large map to explore, little secrets almost everywhere. And if there‚Äôs still a somebody not convince and likes a little challenge, try to mix a little of ideas like, only using certain elements, or only starter characters, and so on. You‚Äôll love this game also for it‚Äôs customizable settings and graphics, all device friendly, and overall, the real great landscape of all the regionsÔºÅ",5
"I love this game so much this is the only game I have in my phone I will never delete this as long as I live. All my friends play this and my family does too! Also, my baby brother is learning how to play! I‚Äôm only 25 years old, and I‚Äôm super duper addicted to this spectacular game! At first, I wasn‚Äôt interested, but Mom said it‚Äôs the greatest game on earth! So I played the whole day, but now I play 12 hours a day! That‚Äôs a lot! All because it‚Äôs my favorite! Everyone, if you are reading this, download now and get addicted! It‚Äôs free and no ads!!!!!!!!!!! üòâüôÇüòÄ",4
It's a good game except the creators of it refuse to listen to the players. Many have told them that they want more representation weather Ts fat people or black people whatever the case is. The cheaters put innplenty of research for the environment the cloths the names but refuse to make melonated characters. The few character that are melonated ar only a little tan. The creators were fastvat makin th enemies tan but not the playable characters. They have made characters that misrepresentnpeople such like Dori. And even with a lot of people giving explanations for why it's wrong the creators refuse to do anything about it. Sadly the characters ar startin to look the same. This game would be so much better would have a better reputation an more players if they actually listened to the players.,1
"It is truly a lovely game, from the lore, story line and quest, music and graphics, everything about it is top teir in my opinion. It is a longer game with new content coming out however, I find that it doesn‚Äôt get boring. There is constantly things that you can do from playing with friends in game or playing through the story line of characters. Very high quality game all around!! I definitely recommend if you are interested in the game then you should check it out!!",5
"This is a great game sure this takes up a lot of storage but that‚Äôs a sacrifice. This game is mainly for pc this is just so people don‚Äôt complain about it being on here. People are never happy, no matter what they give them. And people hate on this game and say the people that play it are furrys but that‚Äôs because they feel like their better when they do that. The only complaint I have is 90 percent of the characters are girls, other then that the game is good. Keep up the good work",5
"Currently it‚Äôs version 2.7, and the only tan/darker-skinned characters are kaeya and xinyan. While the upcoming region Sumeru is based off of the Middle Eastern and South Asian culture, we don‚Äôt seem to be getting any npcs or characters with darker skin. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to have an upcoming region based off of the Middle East, to not include any characters with darker skin tones. I‚Äôm hoping in the future, with the Sumeru region, that there is representation. Representation of darker skin tones, different cultures, and that not all characters are white. While Kaeya and Xinyan have darker skin compared to any other character in the game, in official art they‚Äôre white-washed. Please hoyoverse, listen to the fan base and create characters correctly based on skin color and clothing, without being colorist or stereotypical.",1
"Genshin impacts regions are based on different parts of the world. ( mondstadt - Germany, liyue- china, and inazuma - Japan. ) All of these regions show accurate culture from those places, but I don‚Äôt understand why their new region sumeru isn‚Äôt doing the same thing. Sumeru is based on North Africa/ South Asia and based on some images the characters seem very stereotypical as they‚Äôre taking designs from religious buildings? Also, People in Africa and South Asia have tanner to dark skinned skin tones but all the npcs and 6/7 characters are literally the color white and that‚Äôs pretty unrealistic. Yes I know some people from South Asia/Africa are pale but both areas have a skin bleaching problem and the characters in game are literally glowing. I want realistic representation that isn‚Äôt based on stereotypes.",1
"Hello! I‚Äôve been playing genshin since November of 2020. I‚Äôve been anticipating Sumeru, a land which seemed to be based on Middle Eastern and South Asian countries. However, the recent leaks have revealed there‚Äôs little to no ethnic clothing and they‚Äôre all pale! So far, out of 42 playable characters, only 2 of them are darker skinned. It‚Äôs orientalist and blatantly disrespectful to have so much effort and design for your Chinese and Japanese inspired characters, but nothing for Arab and Indian people. I can‚Äôt even see one clear thing clothing wise showing what culture they‚Äôre from. However Hoyoverse goes and hires a professional Chinese opera singer for one character. Is there not anyone you could properly consult? But go ahead and listen to your Chinese audience and their xenophobia.",1
"It‚Äôs impossible to install the latest update. I‚Äôve freed up several GBs of space, and still, this update won‚Äôt finish. I‚Äôve been trying all day. Not only was this super delayed, they made it impossible for people to play. 
2 stars cause even if I could play, late game is super grindy and there‚Äôs not much to do that isn‚Äôt extremely repetitive. It gets boring fast once you‚Äôre a high enough level, unless you enjoy playing the same domains for hours just to *hopefully* upgrade a sword or character. Also there‚Äôs a co-op mode but you‚Äôre prevented from playing the story together, and there‚Äôs nothing much to do together beyond the same old grinding.",2
"genshin impact is a great game! MiHoYo did a great job with it, although they only have a few characters that are poc. otherwise, the lore is great, and it‚Äôs very simple to get the hang of once you‚Äôre far enough in! each character‚Äôs play style is different and very unique. 

although, if you want to play on mobile like i do, best have more than 10GB of space on your phone! genshin takes up almost 20GB on my phone. I would advise to play on pc, or play station to save room on your mobile device!",5
"I love genshin impact and I used to play it a lot, it had amazing graphics, lovable characters, and many things to do beside the main quest, however a glitch happened to my account when I was trying to log in, it kept on bugging out and won‚Äôt let me in, the annoying thing is I can log into my account on other people‚Äôs devices but on my phone it just won‚Äôt work, even when I got a new phone to try and see if it worked it didn‚Äôt, pls help, I would rate this five stars but that bug just really annoyed me, especially since I had spent months on that account, thanks for reading my review",3
I normally don‚Äôt write reviews on games. But. This game is a really good game. It has a great storyline. The characters are unique and the overall set up is just awesome its like no restrictions to the game. I love the co-op mode the graphics are beautiful and the music is amazing as well.  I wrote this review. Not because of the game because I felt like you really took your time to make this game & give us something to enjoy and I really appreciate it I really do thank you so much hopefully you can make more games like this in the futureüòéüòéüòé,5
"this game is really fun, but the wishing system always‚Äî ALWAYS ruined my day. you could literally spend hundreds of dollars on this game and it would still never give you the character you would want no matter the amount of times you would try. the genesis crystals are very overpriced, so many people have been scammed,  the developers probably couldn‚Äôt care less about how much we feel and just want our money. they know that people are desperate for characters, the prices are scams. another thing, this game is way too laggy and it takes up all of my storage. it‚Äôs really annoying and it‚Äôs making me want to delete the game. i freeze every 30 seconds and have to rejoin the game and it will still be very laggy.",1
Tbh I love this game a little to much but what‚Äôs been irritating is that I‚Äôve been have some type of glitch in my world so when ever I beat maguu kenki to halfway of his hp it always restarts so I‚Äôve only been able to beat him ONCE! and I had someone to help me otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have. So I tried to send a feedback on that issue but when I try to type it it restricts me to typing only a sentence and a half then it tells me to describe it differently so how am I supposed to tell them what‚Äôs wrong if I can‚Äôt even complete my sentence.,4
"Genshin is a great game, it cures your boredom. The story quest is awesome and the characters personalities are so fun. It‚Äôs also very forgiving, every 10 pulls you get a 4 star instead of it just being random. But for you to actually enjoy the game you have to grind. It‚Äôs not a problem for me but I know for some of my friends they just can‚Äôt put that much time into a game. If you want be good at the game it takes a lot of effort. Then again you can just play the game for fun. Overall it‚Äôs an amazing game, honestly I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs free.",5
"I love the anniversary rewards they don‚Äôt owe us anythinggg BUT they still gave us ten wishes, the moon chase event were they didn‚Äôt skip out they got allllll of liyues va‚Äôs to be included which i love and they all had decent interaction time not to mention there web event and all the little events apart of it the chests adding up help to get wishes etc and the fish claymore anyways i liked this event a lot and ppl need to shut up abt the rewards and how other gatcha games r better but they don‚Äôt beat the immersive storyline and the amazing graphics anyways. love this game <33",5
"Anniversary rewards were bad but that‚Äôs not the most important problem. There are serval issues like ignoring community feedback for months, deleting 1 star reviews, not letting players change their signature (kinda like a bio or the status feature on discord.) when they get backlash, ignoring bugs, bad business practices, being greedy, generally trash new releases, and not to mention the anniversary ‚Äúevent‚Äù, which is just the player base giving the game free promotion, fanart, cosplay, photos for a tiny chance of winning SOMETHING. The game is dying, the players are angry, and their ‚Äúattempt‚Äù to fix it was horrible. Genshin impact can be fun and it‚Äôs one of her best games out there but they gotta do better.",1
"I‚Äôm really disappointed in the state of this game. Mihoyo has a goldmine here and unfortunately they know it. They have shown that they have no interest in player feedback and the state of the game has suffered for it. The anniversary is nonexistent, maybe they‚Äôll do damage control later but based on the above I kinda doubt it. Even if they do the fact that it took this kind of outcry says everything. The game is filled with bugs that go unacknowledged and have had several scummy misunderstandings that went without compensation. You and I as customers are not valued, it‚Äôs plain as day. It‚Äôs a shame because this game started off on such a good foot. But I guess with success comes complacency.",2
"I have played this since it came out. I am not pay to win so it takes me days upon days of farming to get new characters and keep up. This company is the biggest joke I have ever seen. Not only do they ignore player feedback, they give such little rewards for all the time and reputation the community has put into this game. These people are truly greedy and it is so sad they do not listen to the players. Their 1 year anniversary awards are terrible. I wasted a whole year playing this game and still have seen no changes in how they compensate the community. We are just here to advertise and give them our money. Mihoyo is a joke. Dont get sucked into this game. You WILL regret it.",2
"I absolutely love the game and character designs. The graphics are gorgeous and the gameplay‚Äôs fun at times, except for the slime balloon daily commission. The commission isn‚Äôt the only problem I have with it, it‚Äôs the fact that I can‚Äôt play the game without my device crashing. I have it set on the lowest graphics setting possible but it still won‚Äôt run the game without crashing seconds later. 

I‚Äôve started to play less because of this but I‚Äôd love to get back to playing more of Genshin when the game is finally able to run properly, especially since Inazuma‚Äôs out. Mihoyo, please fix this!",3
"Its a great game and I‚Äôve been playing for a month or so but ever since the Inazuma update it cant update, It starts updating then as soon as it‚Äôs almost done it just stops. I‚Äôve been trying to update it for 2 days now but it can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve tried on and off WiFi, I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone and deleting enough stuff to let it update but nothing works. I really hope this isn‚Äôt something wrong with my phone and instead something wrong with the game because I don‚Äôt have enough money for a new phone right now.",4
"While I don‚Äôt play on mobile, I want to put this review here so people can see it before they consider downloading it on PC

The first time I downloaded Genshin, it took multiple hours.  The second time I downloaded Genshin, it took two days.  I constantly have problems when I update the version.  I have to use the repair files so often it isn‚Äôt funny anymore.  If it was quicker I wouldn‚Äôt mind so much.  It‚Äôs a fun game.  I find myself spending hours playing it sometimes.  I‚Äôd rate it as 5 stars but I can‚Äôt take the download speeds.  Please fix this.",4
I‚Äôve seen the good reviews on this game and I wanted to try it out. I‚Äôve also seen this app on ads. I can‚Äôt really say anything about the game cause I can‚Äôt play it at all. It might just be my phone but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs not the case. It lets me in the game. The data loads and then I tap to enter the door. That‚Äôs when it crashes. It loads and then takes me out. Idk know if it‚Äôs my phone or not but I still want to play the game really bad.  So can I maybe get an answer why the game keeps crashing? Thanks.,5
"Hi! Just wanted to say that this game is absolutely amazing and the story, combat, and characters are very well made. I‚Äôm new to games like this and I find myself playing for hours and hours straight. However, even though I have a lower end-ish IPad (IPad 5), even with the graphics on the lowest setting, the game constantly crashes when I open up the menus, and when the large cutscenes are playing, my screen freezes while choppy audio plays in the background. I was hoping that there would be another update for lower end devices, and optimize the game. Besides that, this game is amazing.",4
"It was very annoying, i got recommended about this game by a friend and i tried to download but it downloaded and i was about to play the game, it was loading, and then it went out of the app on to the home screen, and i tried this multiple times but it would always be like this, I would have thought that being on an iPhone would be able to play the game but i guess not, it you have a iphone or a phone, i would recommend not getting it, it is a waste of time",5
"First off this game is great, when I can log into the game. This is the issue. I can not log into the game anymore. The email I used and password no longer works. It‚Äôs been 3 months since I was able to log in. I used the link in the game to reset my password, well the link does not work period. No email is sent at all to reset your password. If you want to delete your account to restart the game, must use the same link to reset your password which does not work. And yes, I did check my junk mail inbox. I also receive all kinds of email from the game publisher but zero mail to reset the password. I am giving up trying to reset my password and playing the game.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing this since December 2020 and still absolutely love it. I love open world RPGs and this does that right. Combat is fun, the characters and stories are really interesting, exploration is engaging, and the world is absolutely beautiful. I have a few nitpicks (more dynamic interactions and routines with NPCs like in games like Dragon Age/Mass Effect, Red Dead Redemption, Elder Scrolls; entrance to more buildings; etc.), but they‚Äôre small compared to all the developers have managed to accomplish already. I have a feeling I‚Äôll be playing and enjoying this for a long time.",5
"Ok, I‚Äôm not one of those paid people who write a review... if you don‚Äôt believe me, then whatever . I love this game, I love the characters, their voices, etc. the only problem I have with it, is that it‚Äôs too addicting and the story line is bootiful üëåüèªüåù and developers, PLEASE I BEG OF YOU! BRING BACK SOME OF THE LIMITED TIME CHARACTERS! My advice to- Stay mad trump- 
Wish for Noelle, she is Supa strong, I got out of every temple in under 20 mins because of her. It was so easy with her power move, just hold down her sword and she does a power charged spin attack",5
"Plays very well, not cash shop dependent I was able to get everything so far by just playing the game. Large area to explore, lacks quests compared to other open world games but I kind of like the amount of quests. Story is fun not so mich logical but its based on a strange world. Fighting and tactics are great your knowledge on elements plays a major key. Interactive to the open world it all makes since and works well. Audio does not sync in English looks more natural with Japanese audio. Graphics are stunning considering I play on my phone and it looks even better on pc.",5
"FYI I‚Äôm rank 51 as of writing, I use a physical dps build for playing. (Fischl arrow spam)(Sucrose aoe)(Xiangling for fire)(Qiqi healer)

The endgame just becomes a grind with the only difficulty modifier being more enemy DMG and HP at every world lvl up. (Also rank 40-50 is a slog to get through).  If you play normally all enemies will usually be at or above your lvl. The battle pass is really lackluster only offering 1 special item after you hit lvl 30 in it. Just feels very redundant to play.

One good addition would be a house with garden plots to grow materials. It‚Äôd also be cool to be able to build something in the game yourself. Actually be able to see progress. But hey, that‚Äôs just me.",3
I would give this game a five star but for some reason it keeps kicking me out after a couple minutes thankfully I don‚Äôt lose any progress I keep the same items and I‚Äôm normally in the exact same place( unless your last action was teleporting and then when you come back in you‚Äôre at the place you teleported) the only thing that‚Äôs different is if you have navigation on for a quest that you just picked up along the way it‚Äôs gone when you return and you can‚Äôt find it again which is very frustrating.,4
"I played on every device I could a few weeks ago before the update but nothing worked. My computer couldn‚Äôt get past the first few seconds, my phone was laggy, and my Ipad had the infamous black background. 1.1 fixed all these issues except the lag on my phone but it is a 6S (don‚Äôt judge) this game isn't meant for mobile device but the new update made it possible. Its an amazing game and it looks like something Nintendo would make. If the lag got fixed it would be one of the best open world games.",5
"Hello! I love Genshin Impact. I, by far, think it is the best game I have ever played. I love how lively it looks and how there is always so much you can do, but I tried to play it one time and it kicked me out before I could even get to the Home Screen. I thought it might just need an update but it didn‚Äôt and I tried again, but it still didn‚Äôt let me in. I really hope you can fix it because I don‚Äôt want to not get to play my favorite game. Other than that though, it is still very much my favorite game to escape to! üòÅ",5
"It‚Äôs a really good game only issues I see is the loading times and that the game is still kinda buggy. What I mean by the loading time is just how the game loads stuff like enemies or the world and well... the main menu. It‚Äôs super fun I just hate waiting for my menu to load where I‚Äôm just stuck there waiting for it to pop up whenever, or when I try to do something in game like do challenges I basically sit there waiting for the enemies to spawn and even the chest take forever to spit out the items. I truly love this game it‚Äôs probably one of the first of its kind to be available on mobile for free",4
"The game is great and interesting, the graphics and graphics are really nice, I like this game a lot even though I just played it yesterday, but one point I'm disappointed in this game is the controls  of this game.  I played it on the iPhone so it was a small screen unlike the one on a PC, so when I wanted to change my own controls in settings to make it easier to move because I always accidentally put my finger in  the control button is on the right.  I have been looking for it and want to adapt it to my movements, but in the game settings there isn't any place to set up new controls.  I hope that Developer can add a new setting on how to set up their own movement controls in this game.  Thank you very much.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",2
"In my honest opinion, this is such a fun game beautiful graphics, love the gameplay. I want to give this a 5 star but unfortunately, to get multiplayer you have to basically do the all of the campaign and side quest, the fact that you can‚Äôt open chest in other players world let alone get the rewards it completely unacceptable and should be fixed right away. Unfortunately I have stopped playing this game due to that reason cause I have multiple friends who would love you play this game together but we don‚Äôt want to if their is no reward and it‚Äôs just not fun. I hope you these issues get fixed soon it really is a fun free to play game.",3
"I think Genshin is one of the best developed games I‚Äôve ever played. It maxed out every compartment to make a great game. But, it got too much. When I say that, I‚Äôm not a lazy person. I do ballet 6/7 days a week, sometimes 7/7 days a week. The quests and updates were too fast and I was falling behind very quickly. I tried to stay on top of everything, but eventually I called it quits and stopped playing. It‚Äôs an amazing game is you have a lot of free time, but if you‚Äôre like me and you have other things to do. Just consider that this game is a lot of work.",4
"This game is a clone from multiple popular jrpgs. The is content from Zelda, Tales, Sword Art, Ni No Kuni, Final Fantasy, the list goes on... That is not all too, the game has the worst gacha rates compared to other games in the same genre. The concept of this game shows how greedy this company is. In Japan, there are laws to protect consumers from spending too much money or placing a minimum on gacha limits. This game from China has no problem making you homeless with the 0.6% gacha pull rates.  And what is worst, out of the 0.6%, 0.3% chance for a character and 0.3% for a weapon. I cant even progress into game with such a poor design for the rerolling process. This game is beyond frustrating for me already. The original concept of a game is designed for the players to have fun, not make them more stressful!",1
"i play this game everyday, i love it. I love my characters. i love the fighting. all of it, except for one thing. there is no accurate poc characters in the game. Sumeru, based on African countries, has no actual positive playable characters. Candace, based off a real person, has been wishwashed. Cyno, is very light skinned, and Deyha is even white washed in the advertisings of her. The only dark skin characters in the game are the enemies, like be for real. Hoyo verse can and has made amazing characters and amazing countries like Liyue, based in China. So they can do it. They instead choose to whitewash and villainized black people.",4
"coming from an end game player, this game is kinda gettting worse. Why? Well, the game doesnt even make that much updates so this is literally all you do: do daily comms, spend resin or get condensed resin, and hop off. literally. I would give this game a 10 star if i was still new to the game but its like im too strong now. Yea im grinding artifacts but what for? A
I can already 1 shot tons of bosses without any buffs if this game had an unlimited event that fun then i would have infinite content and would be happy. Sadly, mihoyo doesnt listen to us so ima have to rate this game a 4 star",4
"It‚Äôs a good game, with flawless character designs, and wonderfully coded gameplay. But it needs for instructions for some things. For example, when you‚Äôre on the quest with a famous chef but then when you need to hit 4 fire üî• pedestals, they keep fading and it‚Äôs kinda hard for new people, or people who need more instructions. Like, should you use Amber Or another fire related Genshin character for the fire pedestals? Some people just don‚Äôt understand ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. If you give a setting option to enable more instructions about what you‚Äôre supposed to do, then that would be very helpful. Have a good day or night ‚òÄÔ∏è üåô",3
"Ok I would first like to say that I highly enjoy playing this game,I love the characters designs and personality .the graphics are amazing and the archon quest are fun, and if like fighting games this is the game for you .know the complaint I have is the events  sometimes like you have to be a certain adventure rank to do some and if you just started you missed a lot of fun quests like I missed the first golden Apple event and I wish it was just a archon quest but that‚Äôs just my Opinion it isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.",5
"I am just in love with this game and can never stop playing ( cyno though üò≥) and I probably will never stop playing the game, if you are thinking of downloading this app just note it‚Äôs an RPG and NOT a pay to win! you. should. play.

This game has really cool twists, amazing characters, a beautiful fantasy land that keeps expanding and like no bugs! Most of the bugs are found by accident because how well they are hidden. So you shouldn‚Äôt have a big problem with the bugs!

The game is well designed and the game is progressively getting even better, playing doesn‚Äôt need you to pay where ever you go! The wishing system? ( a gacha system ) oh! It‚Äôs a great machine to get your favorite characters. Like Qiqi‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

"This is the sort of game everyone is here for, and all sorts of audiences are standing by watching the game grow. I‚Äôve only beaten the first boss and have not ranked up once yet, and doing those dungeons are hard. But I need to get gud because that‚Äôs a me problem. The gacha system is BALANCED and doesn‚Äôt need to be changed in any way. I hope to see the next three areas, and play them or watch them (depending on if I get gud). Anyway, recommendations on getting my current team stronger for the rank up?",5
"The developers barely ever listen to the players, there are so many issues in this game that are ignored and I just wish the devs would listen‚Ä¶. I mean why bother survey us when you‚Äôre not going to make an effort to improve and enhance the game so it becomes a much more enjoyable experience. Sumeru is dropping and I hope it‚Äôs changing this game because it gets boring after a week of an upgrade. The events have been quite lackluster and don‚Äôt get me started on then dialogue‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so long it‚Äôs like the characters never stop talking,,, it‚Äôs sad because I used to enjoy this game a lot when it just dropped so Id really like if the devs would be much more interactive with players",2
"I‚Äôm honestly so sad about the new Sumeru update and how it‚Äôs being executed. Only 2 of the playable characters have SLIGHTLY darker skin tones while the rest are pale. It would be appreciated if the people of the various cultures of SWANA were represented correctly and respectfully. There is little to no diversity in the game and the only characters with darker skin get little screen time and are heavily lightened in art. It baffles me how you guys are obviously very capable of making a culturally accurate character when it comes to east asia, but when it came to sumeru, it was clear there was little to no research to the character design or respect. I wish I, and many others could be excited for this update but it‚Äôs just incredibly disappointing and awful.",1
"So I downloaded this app, because it seemed really cool and I‚Äôve seen many people play it. When I got into the app, I signed up and played the beginning story, but I hadn‚Äôt downloaded the whole version. So, I went ahead and tried to download it, but it said I had to make more space on my device because of lack of storage. So I deleted all of my photos, my attachments to messages, and so much more. I then yet again, went back into the app just to get the same message. I have deleted several apps that I use daily, just to keep getting this message. Please give feedback.",3
Not going to lie when I first started playing I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but who would‚Äôve known this game could be so addicting I remember playing this when it first came out and I hated it. But now I can‚Äôt put my phone down for anything unless it‚Äôs to charge thank you so much for the game improvements thank you for giving me hope that phones can actually play games without stupid ad commercials and thank you for the RPG affect you guys rock can‚Äôt wait to see many more improvements,5
"Genshin Impact itself ifs a very good game, dont get me wrong on that, but the representation that people of color are getting in sumeru is completely unacceptable. All the new upcoming characters are almost the exact shade of white, not a pale skintone, but white. Characters in sumeru should have darker skin and it should atleast be darker than the characters that are out now. The upcoming characters were compared to mondstadt characters and ended up being even more white than them. THIS is not representation. None of the upcoming characters are brown or darkskinned. There is currently only two playable brown characters and they are 4 stars.  Some of the npcs in sumeru are darker than Dehya. Please add some darker skinned characters because this poc ‚Äúrepresentation ‚Äú that you guys have is unacceptable.",1
"Genshin Impact is amazing as a free mobile game.  The exploration and story are as full as some console titles.  Unfortunately it adheres to mobile gacha strategy (gacha pulls, lots of grinding, pay to win aspects, daily stamina limits, etc.) but as a regular player I feel like I never run out of stuff to do.   I like being able to play a game like this casually when I‚Äôm on the go without having to invest a lot of time just to enjoy the core elements.  It runs really well on my phone even in spite of the huge size, too.",5
"I have had this game since it‚Äôs release and I can honestly say that this is the most immersive and enjoyable game I have played in a while. As a person who started out playing Skyrim and listening to a lot of twenty one pilots and K-pop: it has lore, it has interactive elements such as books and quest to keep you entertained. 

I love the gatcha feature and how the characters add to the rich storyline and all have a part to play in the ever continuing story. 

The game also has that element of farming if you have no more quest to do or if you get too far into the quest and you want to take a break. 

There is a manga series as well to go along with the game and even extra videos to watch outside of the game that have bits of lore as well. 

Whether you want a game to pass the time or love learning about fictional worlds as much as me, this game has something for everyone!!",5
"As more and more leaks of the new region ‚ÄúSumeru‚Äù are coming out, i saw something. If Sumeru is based of India, or South Asia, why are none of the leaked characters (excluding Collei) brown or dark skinned? And there are only 2 characters with dark skin and that is Kaeya and Xinyan. And that is 2 of of 50+ characters in the whole game and you‚Äôve managed to whitewash both of them in character art that YOU, the CREATORS OF THOSE CHARACTERS have made. Although i love this game as a whole and have made many many memories within the game, the fact is that you need to do better with skin colors and also some representation(which i wont list). So please Hoyoverse, do better with the 3.0 Sumeru characters and NPCs!",2
"This game takes inspiration from real world events and countries, yet fails to do the basics of accurately depicting characters that are from these inspired nations. There are over 40 characters in the game, and out of all of these, there is currently only two that have what is barely considered a tan. Sumeru and Natlan are the only nations that are based off of multiple, smushed cultures and countries (these two nations do not have pale skinned folks), which is extremely disrespectful in itself. These nations already have characters being depicted in a stereotypical manner. The lack of different body types in this game make the characters feel repetitive. This game has so much potential, but it is severely lacking in the diversity department, making it unenjoyable.",1
"I absolutely love this game & everything that comes with it. However, I'm a mobile player & I don't know if this is what it's like on another device, but I crash frequently each time I play it. It sometimes happens when I'm trying to change the members in my party, when I have just teleported somewhere, or when I'm just playing in general. I don't think there's anything wrong with my phone, and a few of my friends have told me they've experienced the same issue. So I believe that should be looked at sooner or later!",4
"Hello, the game is overall good and the characters designs are very nice and pleasing! It makes me wanna have every character in the game, but there‚Äôs something I want in the game that‚Äôs seems to be missing along with other things. One of them is darker skin tones for the new region Sumeru. like character kaeya and xinyan I think they‚Äôre should be more darker characters since Sumeru is coming out and it will make sense since Semeru is kind of like the dessert. Maybe some characters like, with tans? I think GENSHIN players would be happy about it!",5
I really enjoy the game a lot and honestly it‚Äôs the one thing keeping me from being bored. Although there is one small problem and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just me or not but when I got to Adventure rank 25 it kinda just bugged out I guess and now my adventure EXP is above than what it needs to be to get to Adventure rank 26. It‚Äôs not that big of a problem I don‚Äôt think but it‚Äôs just something I think that needs to be fixed. But other than that small bug I‚Äôm having it‚Äôs an excellent game!,5
"This game is so fun! I‚Äôve been playing it since the beginning of 2020 and I‚Äôm still having fun! Although, it‚Äôs kind of gets boring that you don‚Äôt get as much primo gems in updates. üòî We should usually get at least 10 wishes every update. I‚Äôve kind of stopped playing Genshin daily since I don‚Äôt have enough time to always try earning primo gems to save up for characters I really want.. I ended up skipping almost all of my favorite character banners since I was always so busy everyday. Anyways, this game is really detailed and fun for me! Thank you. ü•∞",4
"This game is honestly great it runs good on mobile (IF YOU HAVE A GOOD WORKING DEVICE) ! Theres one problem, this game gets boring really easily at higher ar or honestly when your world quests are done when theres a new update i mean it gets fun for a day till you finish it so its really easy to get burnt out. Like for example when sumeru comes out it‚Äôll probably be rlly fun for maybe like a week I guess, but you‚Äôll get bored easily. I left this game for a few months and honestly I‚Äôm doing fine without it, BUT I love this game so much the characters designs are amazing AND yae miko is out now!!",4
"Having grown up on RPG games, I‚Äôve missed from time to time the immersive storytelling and exploring I got experience. While spending hundreds of dollars on new counsels and games may open up future fun memories, this game allows me freedom and new memories without a hefty price tag (so long as I don‚Äôt alway pour money into the gatcha mechanics available). 

I regularly consume anime as well, so this game‚Äôs aesthetics are right up my alley. It is nice to know that this game is available across platforms besides my tablet. So when counsel upgrading comes, this game can travel with me to those controller systems.",4
"Liyue and Inazuma scenes remind me of my hometown, I‚Äôve been watching the fireworks with my grandparents in my childhood and I cried in every a midnight 

I still love it so much but maybe you can change back to low size GB because I can‚Äôt afford icloud storage and genshin‚Äôs update size 3.44 in same time, I won‚Äôt download new package has 3.44 size after new patch 2.2-5.0 maybe increased size GB. also I haven‚Äôt been use my laptop is old and don‚Äôt working as well to downloading it was a small problem only I use my own iphone",5
"Game looks good, has a decent story, and fills that need to explore/fight monsters.

Outside of that, that‚Äôs all there is. The endgame is non existent. You just continue to grind using resin (basically stamina that allows you to collect rewards) for new items that may or may not have the stats you want (it‚Äôs random). And even when you‚Äôre trying to grind for better gear, the resin cap is so limiting that it‚Äôs hard to do. 

Also, it‚Äôs not new player friendly. The game lines to advertise new characters. As of writing this, Kokomi is the current banner, but even if a new player obtains her they have to go very far in the story to be able to even get the items necessary to upgrade her. 

Anniversary can be it‚Äôs own topic. However, as a player who has played since the beginning, always bought Welkin moon and battle pass, along with the occasional top ups, it‚Äôs very disheartening to see how stingy Mihoyo was with anniversary rewards. The company does not care about its player base, so why should I as a consumer care about giving them money?

If you play, do so as free to play only, as I will moving forward.",1
"Mihoyo went from being very generous towards genshin players, but as time went on and more, Mihoyo became greedy and catered mainly to p2p players. while it‚Äôs not necessarily bad, Mihoyo is a billion dollar company that refuses to even give us decent anniversary rewards, which is unfair to all genshin impact players. we all expected something like a free character, or at the very least 10 free wishes to HOPEFULLY win their terrible gacha system, but all we‚Äôve received so far is a web event where you walked through your adventures (which was nice) and 40 primo gems for all of the work and money that‚Äôs gone into this game. For something that‚Äôs supposed to be going on for 10+ years, Mihoyo sure did cost themselves over one anniversary, and that‚Äôs just disappointing",1
"I adore this game but omg stop the crashing, it happens at least 3-4 times when play it and my phone gets super warm too the touch, it‚Äôs like the mobile version can‚Äôt handle the game. Fix this guys, I‚Äôm sick of the crashing and sporadic crazy bad lag. I play on iPhone with IOS15 so I have what it needs to work so why the crashing and lag. I have fiber optic internet so it‚Äôs not my internet speed. I read lots of reviews that complain about crashing too so this is a real issue. Who cares how fun and beautiful it is if it keeps crashing, major turn off and if gets any worse I‚Äôm going to stop playing.",3
"Ok, I am FREAKING OBSESSED WITH THIS GAME! Its graphics are incredible, (as well as the story) and the new characters and updates are frequent. Here‚Äôs the thing. I was completing the Find a Way Through the Wind Storm, when one of my characters died. I teleported out of there to a statue, and when I went to go back in, it wouldn‚Äôt let me back in the wind barrier! I tried looking up glitches and tutorials on what to do, but none of them worked, and I‚Äôm panicking right now! Please give me a response so I can figure out what to do!",5
"Genshin Impact is one of the best games I have played in my entire existence. It is playable on the computer, PS4, PS5, phone, and it will arrive on the Nintendo Switch soon. It does take up a decent amount of storage, but it is well worth the enjoyment that you get. With the sleek character models, fast paced combat system, amazing sound quality, unique gacha system, and a open world at your fingers, it feels as if you could be one of the characters. As there is much more that I haven‚Äôt explained, I implore you to experience Genshin Impact for yourself.",5
"This is such an amazing game with the graphics, character design, music, etc. I have put time and money into this and have work hard to get where I am in the game now, but genesis crystals prices are a little high for me. I am a user of the younger age section and have limited money. I would like to but genesis crystals to roll for more people since it takes me a couple days to weeks to move up for a 10 pull. Overall, it‚Äôs a beautiful game that is absolutely worth the time and I love it.",5
"This game is amazing, and is definitely the best game that I have ever played. I love that you can play it anywhere with your iPhone/iPad, it isn‚Äôt just on computers and consoles. The anime-styled graphics are gorgeous, and there is a near endless amount of exploration and quests to complete. I don‚Äôt really like the gacha mechanic to unlock new characters and would prefer to outright buy them, but I understand that they would make more money that way. Regardless of the gacha component, this is an amazing game and the best open world RPG by far.",5
"this game is by far the best one i‚Äôve played, i honestly cant believe that this game is free. the storyline, quests, characters, graphics, designs + more are amazing! of course, i do have some problems with it since i‚Äôm f2p, for example, the wish system, or getting game currency is hard. you get 1 wish every 3 days. it‚Äôs SO HARD to get wishes and the wishing system is not it. 90 wishes for a 5 star. that‚Äôs about 14k primo gems. BUT, there‚Äôs the 50/50. that means that there‚Äôs a chance that you DON‚ÄôT get the character promoted on the limited banner. then players have to spend 28k primos, do y‚Äôall really think f2p players can get that much?",3
"This game is really amazing. The graphics are are very nice, and the story is interesting. I can‚Äôt wait keep playing this game every time I‚Äôm not busy! But the one problem is the character that we are playing. I understand that they have a twin, so the kinda will need to look alike. But I kinda would love it if we got to change some of our character outfits, hair, ect... I‚Äôm still in a low level, and maybe once I‚Äôm on a higher level, I can change my character. But that would not make sense. I would really love it if that was an option. Other than that, this game is great and so interesting!",4
"My tablet cannot handle it but that‚Äôs fine, actually, all the more reason to love it! It has amazing graphics, character designs and voice acting, as an aspiring voice actress and character designer (and by that I mean I do it for fun all the time), this is the stuff of my dreams! Going back to the graphics the anime style is absolutely adorable and I could probably rant all day about how much I love the areas and towns and stuff, if you have a strong CPU or Mobile that can handle this i totally recommend this game!",5
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND ADDICTIVE!! I spend 10 hours a day playing this game. All the low reviews are from people who don‚Äôt know how to make an account (it‚Äôs not that complicated), lag (this game doesn‚Äôt lag on all mobile devices, just get better internet üò¨), or saying this game is a rip off (rip-off of what? nothing.)

even before i got my first 5* (venti üòå), this game was still fun. The only way you can‚Äôt have fun is if you don‚Äôt know how to do anything and just go and complain it‚Äôs the games fault

i can‚Äôt wait for more updates :D",5
"I invested time and money in this game , I love the game BUT recently someone hacked my account and stole all my weapons and artifacts. NO I didn‚Äôt give my account or enter any funny website . Someone must have broke into mihoyos servers some how and apparently there‚Äôs been multiple accounts being hacked . And mihoyo isn‚Äôt doing anything about it , they literally told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything ! Not even trying to get my weapons or artifacts back  Or even giving primogems as a compensation for the hacking damage done to my account. After the email I received saying they couldn‚Äôt do nothing about it & even tho it doesn‚Äôt cost them anything to give free primogems or items or artifacts. Am disappointed and I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll play the game again.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing the game for a couple of months now and it is amazing. The animation is so fluid, the story is so enticing, and I absolutely love the characters. I do have one concern, for a few days I kept getting kicked out from the game. Today is the worst of them all, I couldn‚Äôt finish the last of my daily commissions without being forced out of the game and having to start all over from the beginning. I don‚Äôt know if its just me but I hope it goes away soon so I can enjoy the game in peace.",5
"First, just that I‚Äôm on mobile and it‚Äôs really good but the cutscenes are low quality for me. Next, I got a bit far and it was pretty good still but when I got to the town or something where you unlock Amber I did some things. Then, I was going to do anther thing in the game but it glitched and i was going through the floor and random stuff and then I exit out and went back in the game but there was a black screen and I tried over and over even shut down my mobile device but it still won‚Äôt work so I really hope it will go away but I still love this game so it‚Äôs okay",4
"I love this game! I play it all the time. The characters are cool, and grinding for materials is fun. The resin system kind of bugs me sometimes, but I think changing it would be just as hard as keeping it the same, it would have downsides. I‚Äôm only worried that in the future it will take up too much storage space! it already occupies 8 gb on my phone, and we‚Äôve only completed 2 regions.  I also wonder how the leveling system will work over time, we‚Äôre already up to level 90, how would it look by the end of the game? Anyways, I love this game!",5
This game is so amazing. An open world game that actually feels like an open world game that belongs on the ps4. The characters are amazing the story is interesting. There‚Äôs always something to do in this game. You can follow the story or get sidetracked in the open world and explore. There is one thing that kinda takes away the fun and that is the wish system. I wish (no pun intended) that we could get more of those stones to wish more and get more characters. Overall this game already has my attention and I crave more of it. I‚Äôm a week so this game touched my heart and soul.,4
"Hard to put into words. You can feel it in the world, and how it‚Äôs been crafted. it feels like they genuinely care about this game. I could definitely be wrong. But you can usually tell the difference between when a product is good because a company threw money at it until it was good, and when a product is good because someone had an idea for a world they were genuinely interested in building. And guess what? These guys did a spectacular job making this world something I want to explore every nook and cranny of.",5
"This game is really good for a long time. Seriously really good, but once you hit a certain point the cracks begin to show. 

The gacha system is already bad so I won‚Äôt talk about that, but the stamina system is so bad it makes the game just miserable. You are gated hard by the amount you can play because of the stamina system. It makes too hard to raise new characters. So optimally you invest in 1, but even doing that, there‚Äôs not enough stamina to get enough materials/money to even afford 1 character. At that point why roll for new characters when you won‚Äôt be able to even use them?

Not only that but the content is just not there. Once you have explored the world, done the story, and opened all of the chests, your content is now running around opening common chests that have respawned and drop virtually nothing. All so you can push your AR higher to get stuck at another upgrade wall by the stamina system. 

Again this game is incredible until you hit the wall then it just becomes a game of frustration, with no answer from the devs about anything.",2
"For me being on an ipad 6 and it still running beautifully is truly amazing :) there is only one major bug that keeps on happening to me (i know that i have the lowest recommended ipad but i would appreciate it if it was fixed). About every 5 minutes or so the app crashed for no apparent reason. it usually happens when teleporting or going to the wish menu or when entering cutscenes. for some reason it never happens in missions. over all a truly stunning and beautiful app, and if they fix the bug i just stated it would be the best app of it type :) would highly recommend.",4
Hello Developers first of all this game is the best mmorpg game I have ever played in my entire life but I need you guys to fix worship statue into something like respect statue or praise statue because worshipping a statue is against my religious beliefs and even disrespectful so it‚Äôs something that I cannot do so I would like you guys to pls fix that. Pls read this and reply to me that way so I know you guys read the reviews and you guys care about us players thank you. After you fix that issue I will give it 5 stars and even invite my friends to play it. My brother already has it but he has stopped playing due to worshipping the statues.,4
"the game takes WAYYYY too much storage for mobile users but it‚Äôs so good, every now and then i have to take breaks for a bit but that‚Äôs just because i‚Äôm not good at keeping interest in anything for a long time before it feels like a chore that‚Äôs really just a personal problem. but overall, beautiful game

there also really badly needs to be different skin tones and races not just for the playable characters but also for NPC‚Äôs, if you‚Äôre going to make a regional game you need regional people, races and cultures. and that means different body types and skin tones",4
"This game goes beyond my expectations and turn any mobile into console - the graphics and sounds blow me away and the story is interesting so far - the only negative problem now is how fast it drain the battery even though I am playing on an iPad Pro 2018 generation however I must say even if it was on a laptop I doubt I ll get a better battery result duo to its graphics - if you want to enjoy yourself and have fun I recommend this game to everyone. 

Ps: - Thank you developers for making this game and also labeling it FREE it‚Äôs deserve more Praise .",5
"I see so many negative reviews about how the game won‚Äôt open or it keeps crashing or that it won‚Äôt load. This is not the game‚Äôs fault. It even says in the description that you need a more recent phone (iPhone 8+ or more recent in ios standards) in order for it to work. You guys have older phones, of course a game of this quality won‚Äôt work for you. But it‚Äôs not the game‚Äôs fault. Please read the description next time you leave a bad review.",5
"I‚Äôve been recently wanting to merge our accounts because there might be stuff some people want to hear from the auto count and stuff somebody doesn‚Äôt have so you can just transfer the stuff that you want to the thing so if you want a weapon just click on it and then just say transfer to which server then transferred to the server if you wanna transfer the whole account to a different server, did you do that just merge them",5
"Best game I've ever played! It has great Quality and story Plot overall, but, a few things I‚Äôve encountered that Left me a bit confused and a little annoyed, I was going to log in and I put in the email and password in, And I logged in and did the Puzzle quiz, But it said ""Account or Password error"" So, I‚Äôm not sure if it is My device or is it something like a Bug in the Game? It had worked last time, But even so, Keep up the good work! I hope this game goes a long way.",5
"I have been playing this game for a while and I love everything about it. There are so many secrets to explore and wonderful things to discover. I love all the elements of battle and the main story all in one. There are gorgeous graphics and the characters have vibrant and quirky personalities! It does not take up much space, and which I know. A lot of people say it does, but they are really overreacting. Anyway, I really hope if you read this then you will want to download this game soon! Goodbye!üôÇüòÄ",5
"This game is honestly really good and has amazing design, but content started to thin out once you‚Äôre done with everything. I‚Äôve been playing this game for 2 years, and I still love the game but I don‚Äôt go on as much as I did before. I‚Äôm AR 59, and I‚Äôve cleared almost cleared all of the content in update 3.4. I go on for like 5-10 minutes just to do commissions and resin burn unless it‚Äôs a new update. I do recommend this game, but just to let you know, you may run out of content if you spend a lot of time in the game.",4
"I absolutely love this game, the game has amazing character designs, beautiful regions, and the game quality it great to! the only problem i have is the storage, i play on ipad and phone which is a problem bc i mainly play on my phone, when i started playing the game i only had 65 GB when i start, and now so far of playing i‚Äôve had to delete about 2037 photos/videos, 16 apps, and had to buy more storage just for this game, it makes things really hard for me and other mobile players, and as a f2p it doesn‚Äôt make things any better.",4
Genshin. Such a beautiful and amazing game. I started playing last year and I only played it for a bit because I got bored of it and it took up too much space. But after a while I started to play it again back in august. I loved it ever since then. Me and my friends love playing on it and fighting monsters together and talking about it every single day. I love it so much I just had to give it five stars. Thank you hoyoverse (sorry if I spelled the name wrong lol) for this beautiful game.,5
"Every time I try to get someone to play this game and say the amazing facts they keep delaying and hesitating to get this game it‚Äôs really wonderful and to my surprise only a few a worlds in virtual reality has amused me a lot that I wish I was born in this world such as Genshin is the one of the few.   It‚Äôs a adventure and honestly put hard work and time into it, playing it will eventually get addicting, just don‚Äôt push too much

Don‚Äôt rush every journey has its end.

And of course this quote originates from this game.",5
"as someone who has played genshin for a pretty long time (ar 56-57) i recently quit due to boredom since story was non existent and the new gaa event was absolute dumpster fire. but what really infurinates me as a middle eastern, is that Sumeru, a place based off of south asia, has absolutely ZERO dark skinned/ HALF south asian looking characters, and dont even get me started on how the actual dark skinned characters are the ‚Äúenemies‚Äù even though they are the original residents of the sumeru region who are fighting against their colonizors, which are the playable ‚ÄúSumeru‚Äù charcters. Even if hoyo does give us a dark skinned character, it most definitely will be a 4 star and be HEAVILY stereotyped or whitewashed in official art. if you plan on downloading/redownloading this app, dont.",1
"The lore and gameplay is interesting and entertaining, it keeps me engaged. But when playing this game you simply cant avoid the obvious issue of there only being two playable POC characters. The money to genesis crystal ratio is trash. This game is not worth your money. For a game who claims to take inspiration from real world cultures and places, it is severely lacking. The only two black characters are of lesser rarity than the 48 pale characters. They treat their player base badly, and the stereotypes show that this game is blatantly racist. Xinyan, one of the two darkskinned characters is depicted as loud and scary. Dori, a leaked sumeru (middle east) character is a genie, who fights with a magic lamp. Fix your game Hoyoverse. I know those billions of dollars can do something.",1
"To be honest I‚Äôve never wrote a revive before but how the game presents its self on front you might not see it but once you look further down you can see darker things. Every place in the game is heavily stereotyped, like when you look up something and the first image you see in Google. As well with 3.0 on the way, an area based on South African-middle eastern area and what we got for representation and all the characters accept for one are paper white. Many people have spoken up about this and wanting more representation and when you only give people a single character people will not be happy especially with your previous actions of only have two other dark skin toned character in the game and 5 body models.",1
"Ok before I start I love this game
But there are some problems.
First problem is that when your playing at random times it just kicks you out of the game for no reason and if your lucky enough it will kick you out while your doing wishes and you will use the fates and get nothing from them. Example I got yae miko from a wish and because it kicked me out I don‚Äôt have that character anymore.
The second thing is that the fps gets real bad after reaching a new or boss area in the game.
Plz fix theses minor glitches",4
"This game is so fun to play it‚Äôs like a mix of Oceanhorn and Legends of Zelda Breath of The Wild, I love the AMAZING graphics, and how all the characters talk. Paimon is so cute looking and you have several characters to pick and unlock! Keep updating to make this game soo much better. I have one thought that I think everybody who played this also wants so I speak for all Genshin Impact players when I say, please make it so I can play in a server and have a friend and do co-op who is in another server (e.g Europe+Americ). Thanks for the GREAT game keep up the good work!",5
"I am really in love with this game! But the things is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just that it takes up SOOO MUCH SPACE!! I only get to play for a limited time and it is really annoying! If you could make it not like that you would get like millions of people to join. Also, when I try to play on my iMac it doesn‚Äôt work. Like why can we play on a mobile device but not play on the same company-
Apple 
I would love to play with my friends and have more fun, but K can‚Äôt do that at ALL. I keep trying to play and I‚Äôll tell you this‚Ä¶ A LOT of people will agree with me. So please make it not so, big of a space hog, and make it kinda the opposite",3
"i love this game and play it daily but they fix bugs and have updates all the time and seem to really focus on the feedback except one. there is a geoculus bug. to finish a mission, you have to have it and i‚Äôve done all i can to fix it accordingly and it won‚Äôt fix. i‚Äôve never left a review on a game but if anyone else has this issue pls interact with this or leave a review similar. i‚Äôve reached out with pictures and emails and nothing in response. other than seeming to neglect small but important issues, this is a great game to play and really get into.",4
"HoYoverse, you really outdid yourselves when you made this game. During COVID-19, all the games I was playing were getting a bit bland. I had seen it all. Until I saw one of your games advertisements and thought‚Ä¶ this is a great game! I wasn‚Äôt wrong. I‚Äôm happy to play a game every day that I don‚Äôt get bored with. I love the landscaping and the open-world play style too! I can‚Äôt wait to see Sumeru and how the game will develop over the years. 

Overall, my favorite game ever. PLAY IT 
Keep up the good work HoYoverse!",5
AHHHH this gameee it‚Äôs free!?wow it‚Äôs amazing the characters are amazingly designed and adorable it is a basic fighting game but amazingly fun I play it all the time it‚Äôs sooo fun and the graphics are amazing as well if I where you download this game real fast you won‚Äôt regret it it even tells you where to go for your next mission on the map I love to find more characters when I go to explore different places or levels the characters all have amazing background story‚Äôs 5/5 star game this should have a better rating,5
"I don‚Äôt fully blame the devs as China is cracking down on a lot of unnecessary things lately and these poor folks are having to deal with that mess. But it is unfortunate for those of us who live in areas where this ‚Äúcontent‚Äù is not objectionable, we still have to see things censored to appease China‚Äôs increasingly unrealistic standards. I‚Äôm referring to the new cutscene and character design direction going forward.

I worry that it will affect creative freedom of MiHoYo. These devs created a masterpiece of a mobile game and deserve to tell their story and create their characters the way they desire.",4
This game is definitely a must play game if I were to have one game on my device this would be it. There‚Äôs so many things to do and the fact there‚Äôs no ads what so ever is so reliving. Amazing RPG action game and they update not to soon and they don't take way to long to update even though the updates are a must see. I highly recommend playing this game if your an anime fan because the characters are so cute and the game itself is so high quality. This game is the next level!,5
Okay so this game is the best I got addicted like very fast but there are minor issues so in 2.1 I tried to update it and it wouldn‚Äôt work even when I put my Apple ID and password I even changed my password but I had to remove the app and download it again and wait for the full package to download but it did keep my adventure rank and characters safe at the most but I had to wait almost 2 weeks to figure that out and I was extremely stressed and I wanted to get raiden really bad so that scared the life out of me but I kind of worked out,4
"Ok, first of all this game is amazing! Congratulations on making game of the year by the way. Second of all something happened to me. I was randomly kicked out of my mihoyo account, which I don‚Äôt remember the password to. I never really thought that something like this would happen so I didn‚Äôt bother writing it down. All of my progress is gone. Other than that the game is most definitely one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Keep up the great work!",5
"I don‚Äôt typically write reviews because most of the time I let my money talk instead. However, I feel that sharing my insight into this game in particular will be helpful for both future downloaders and the Mihoyo team (if they really do care what people are saying).  

Love the game. There‚Äôs so much to do and it takes a lot of binge playing to get bored (which to me is a good thing). Lots of characters to play and the pace you can progress is decent, neither too fast nor too slow. 

What I dislike about Genshin Impact is that the customer support is terrible. I‚Äôm writing now two weeks into trying to regain access to my account and it‚Äôs frustrating that they make it so difficult to get in touch with someone that can assist me. Seriously, what does it take to make this happen‚Ä¶? I mean at this point an automated response telling me to wait five years would be warmly welcomed. 

I would give this game a 1* if it weren‚Äôt for the excellent graphics and experience in the game itself (which to me is 4*).",2
I love this game my cousin is the one who showed me this amazing app there is not one thing wrong with this game but I‚Äôm in the middle of doing the quest where I‚Äôm getting all the lost books for Lisa but I‚Äôm stuck on the part where I have to defeat all the cyro slimes in 30 seconds but I will defeat all whenever there is about 13 seconds left but it gives me more slimes to kill it‚Äôs just really hard and mihoyo if you see this pls change it. But overall its an amazing game and definitely deserves a 5 star rating!!! üòäüòäüòä,5
"Honestly love the game, so successful and addicting. Only problem is, it‚Äôs hard to play on mobile. Hands cramp, not enough storage, phone overheats and causes more hand pain. I was excited to hear they were going to bring it to the Nintendo Switch but it‚Äôs been like a year since there‚Äôs be any update on that?? I hope they do bring it to the Nintendo Switch because if not, I‚Äôll be forced to just stop playing entirely. It‚Äôs already hard enough to log on every day. Only thing keeping me going is it coming to the switch so I can still be up to date when it comes to.",3
I feel as if they only care about revenue while I find the game very fun I feel that you have to spend a lot of money to get far and for people who enjoy the game but can‚Äôt pay for every weapon banner or new characters banner/rerun I just wish that they were a little more generous as how it is you have to spend money to do well in the game if you don‚Äôt you will most likely have one or two five stars by ar 40 on the other hand you could have all the five stars before ar 20 if you spend money I find the game very fun but I wish it was easier to earn primogems thank you for reading,3
"Alright so I‚Äôve only played Genshin for a few months, but omg I‚Äôm already ar 55! (high level for people who haven‚Äôt played) Honestly Genshin is one of my favorite and (I‚Äôd consider it) one of the best mobile games out there! Yes BOTW and Genshin have many similarities (many) but Genshin still is very different from a lot of aspects! Also when reading reviews about it burning up their phone that‚Äôs only because the quality of Genshin on mobile is much worse than Pc or Xbox, so keep that in mind!",5
"When I start the game, my game just glitch and the image were lagging a lot. The graphics were very great and same thing for the characters. The parachute were so hard to do it because the characters want me to do the parachute assignment. It is go straight then go back. That don‚Äôt make sense because I cant go back but only could go straight down. In the logging in, they want me to said something, when I did it said that your storage is too much, then I deleted my some games and it still won‚Äôt let me in again, I try again 3 times and finally it work! It is cool games I ever played",3
I‚Äôve been playing this game since pretty much release on playstation. The game is truly amazing and even though the anniversary rewards aren‚Äôt everything that everyone wanted them to be i still really love it. but I just want to say thank you Genshin team for making this game I know i might sound weird but this game and the fandom helped me get through this year and i met one of my best friends on this game and had so many great experiences from all the events. Thank you Mihoyo.,5
"Hi!! I love genshin a lot but I have one problem with mobile genshin so I was wondering if mihoyo could fix this, sometimes it kicks you out a lot when your playing out of no where which is really annoying and there‚Äôs been some color glitches and a glitch when you zoom in too close on a characters head and it‚Äôs kinda creepy,the head glitch is on all platforms, but other then that genshin is a great app!! Just the glitches are annoying. That‚Äôs all I have to say.",5
"Players love this game and everything it came to be in just ONE YEAR. With that said, we have been how the game went from basic/standard things to new exciting events or powerful characters. Yet although the game has released more content, like discoverable areas, there other things and  mechanics that don't make sense or in reality won't be used at all, like serenitea pot. 

While many are complaining about the WORTHLESS ANNIVERSARY REWARDS, which are TRASH, I wanna talk about some mechanics of the inazuma characters. They all came out a lil nerfed, or they need buffs. 

Mihoyo needs to do BALANCE PATCHES so we can keep balancing the game with the newer content. So every character is able to keep up in their own way.",2
"Originally my score for this game would have been 5 stars, as it‚Äôs one of the best ‚Äú(gacha)‚Äù games I‚Äôve played in a while (it has the polish and gameplay of a full blown AAA game). However, due to the recent anniversary rewards, or should I say lack of, I lowered the score to 3 stars. Anniversaries are supposed to bring new players in while also providing a reward/gift for those that have played or even spent any money on the game. The lack of anniversary rewards simply make me feel like the time I put in this game throughout the year was not respected. Here‚Äôs to hoping they actually listen to feedback and become a bit more generous‚Ä¶",3
"This game has brought me a lot of joy, and is absolutely stunning both aesthetically and sound-wise. I do have a couple of suggestions and or opinions on a couple of things. If you‚Äôd like to see, keep reading, if you don‚Äôt, just know that i do recommend this game to nearly anyone! <3

Some of my suggestions are...
Some of the SFX for footsteps aren‚Äôt exactly correlated to what the character is walking on, most noticeably, stone. Stone, for some reason, sounds like dirt, and water sounds like squishing a handful of soap excess in your hands. Those two are the only I‚Äôd complain about. 

Now, here‚Äôs what irks me a bit. The obtaining of characters. It‚Äôs so much of a hassle, that I have remorse for the game itself every now and again. It seems really unfair, once it gets to a certain point. There‚Äôs only so much work a player is willing to do just to get a weapon or an item you don‚Äôt need.
Otherwise, this game is delightful.",4
"This game is truly amazing and I‚Äôve been having a lot of fun playing it. Honestly, there‚Äôs no mobile game I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs as great as this one. The only problem is that whenever I play it, 5-10 minutes later I get kicked out of the app. I really like playing this game and this is the only problem I have with it. It used to lag but the update fixed it, so I thought it just needed the update to keep the game from kicking me out, but it hasn‚Äôt fixed that at all. In case you need this info, I play on the latest generation of the iPod. Please fix this, I really want to continue playing.",3
"so i‚Äôve been playing genshin for awhile now and managed to get very far into the game. i stopped playing for a couple weeks because of things coming up and then went into the game the other day when i had some free time. when i go in it takes me to the first cutscene. little did i know, my account had been reset and i lost all my stuff. i also had a different uid than before. almost 450 hours wasted. i tried contacting mihoyo but i didn‚Äôt get any help. long story short, if your planning on grinding the game and spending money, know that there may be a chance you could get all your progress deleted for no reason. genshin impact was my favorite game for a very long time. beautiful graphics, cg, amazing mechanics and so on. i hope mihoyo can fix this issue so we can continue playing the game as normal.",5
"This game is absolutely beautiful and there is so much free content, and not much paid content so it‚Äôs a very unique game. When my friends first told me to play I was very very hesitant because I thought it would be something like summoners war or toram online with either pay to win or constant unbearable grinding(especially unbearable when you have a busy life) but it‚Äôs not like that. The graphics are so cute, amazing characters and almost fully voiced over which helps the immersion üòä",5
"As someone who has played a big amount of Asian mmorpg‚Äôs and just rpg‚Äôs. This is a very streamlined and relaxing experience. Not to mention the giant array of voice actors. 
But this is my first gacha and my wallet is screaming for help. What a terrible game to release during quarantine, lol. 

A Question: Why does it have to be online? So that players don‚Äôt hack the gacha feature? Just disable only it without internet. And to make sure everything is as it‚Äôs supposed to be, you can also keep game files on the server to check in between internet connections. 
This would be fantastic to play on a long plane flight.",4
"I love this game so much and I would totally give it a 5 stars if I didn‚Äôt have this problem. So I can join Genshin like normal but whenever I try to open notices it kicks me out and I have to log in again, this is a problem since I really wanna check notices since it have stuff in it, I really hope you can fix it, if you cant it‚Äôs fine‚ò∫Ô∏è Have a good day/night!

Edit: I tried redownloading it but I don‚Äôt think it fixed it since it kicked me out when I tried to change my artifactsüòï",5
I love the game! As you can tell I have it on my IPad but I‚Äôve even downloaded it on my PS4 and very addicting this game is great overall and I know I will NEVER stop playing this game. I would say the only problem is how low of a chance it is to get things of 5 star rarity and when you do it‚Äôs mostly weapons not characters. So I would boost chances of getting 5 star things to 1 or 2% so that why for people who don‚Äôt want to spend money including me don‚Äôt get to angry at our summons if we worked hard or we had to do hours of farming yet nothing good.,5
"Seriously I can‚Äôt believe that this is a mobile game. I‚Äôm usually the type of person to play a game for a few days and then delete it, but Genshin is different. I have consistently played daily since October of 2020 and this game never disappoints. Of course it‚Äôs not perfect, but oh my gosh is it good. The story is engaging and interesting, it‚Äôs not like any other. The game mechanics are really nice and allows for easy play. The characters are great as well and each has their own developed story. Amazing job and a huge congratulations to the developers and the whole team!",5
"I may be slightly biased because I know someone who did voice acting for the game but I find the game absolutely amazing. The game is similar to legend of Zelda Breathe Of The Wild in the way that you play, you fight enemies and unpack a rich storyline while continuing to grow your power. I enjoy the mechanics and the glider is really fun to glide off of tall stuff. It says it is recommended for 12+ but I think even a 9 year old kid would enjoy it. This game is truly amazing and I suggest that you buy it. Sorry that this was a bit long of a response :p I hope you are all doing well!",5
"This is my favorite gameüíóüíóüíó I can‚Äôt play this in my iPhone because it turn black or the character doesn‚Äôt show up.... even the map tooüôÉ
I play this is my computer but since now we are stay home my brothers are constantly playing the computer but Idk why this is happening in my iPhoneüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢‚úåÔ∏è
Idk but I still give it 4 because when you play it in the computer it actually really goodü§Øüò≥ the characterü•µ you can‚Äôt make a character but the already have a character so you chooses or get‚ò∫Ô∏è
I really hope that some people can play at there phone not just the computer üôÉüíó",4
"I‚Äôm betting this game is going to be great. I downloaded it and played through the first intro mission.  But, and here‚Äôs my problem, after the intro, in order to continue a prompt came up saying I had to download the rest (full version) of the game.  I was playing on my 2017 IPad 32GB, and already had needed to clear space to download the intro.  I‚Äôd have had to clear out most of my other games just to download the rest of this one.
Looking forward to this, but it‚Äôs going to have to wait until I eventually update to a newer, larger storage, iPad.",4
"I hate to say this. But I wish I didnt play th√≠ game from the begining. because its is not just 10/10 but also too touch! 
I have never crying while playing game. but in this game . the later main story the toucher it is. Love, family, relegion. everything are so good and meaningfull. 
This is the 2nd life of me already. 
I dont know should I say thank you to Genshin or not because you really make me feel good in game but make me spend alot of time for it too. 
I guess... Thank you so much! and I am really looking for the new maps and new story .",5
"This game is great, but let‚Äôs be honest, its nearly unplayable on mobile because it lacks controller support. It was developed alongside two other versions that support controller and mouse and keyboard, but this one doesn‚Äôt even support controller. 

For one, it‚Äôs a pain to just pick up items. constantly moving the position of my hand to mash away on items, or even to simply talk to someone is extremely annoying. 

Combat isn‚Äôt undoable, but it‚Äôs clunky compared to mouse and keyboard and controller. Archery is a pain unless you‚Äôve been playing a lot of shooters on touch controls, and tbf, I‚Äôve played mobile shooters and it just seems sloppy on here in comparison to say COD or PUBG. 

It‚Äôs a small feature to add, to simply map the same controls you mapped for the other two versions, and I‚Äôm certain many of us will appreciate that. Otherwise, an excellent game, I‚Äôd give it 5 stars instead of 4 with the addition of controller support.",4
"To unlock constellations you need to actually get the same character 6 times in the shop and that‚Äôs really unfair that‚Äôs a lot of money that most people don‚Äôt have because everything is by chance I think that it‚Äôs unfair and because of not being able to get all the constellations it‚Äôs almost impossible to get your character at it‚Äôs full strength please allow the constellations gems for your characters to be grind able in game like with a boss or something PLEASEEE!!!!! Really would hate to leave a great game because my character is limited unless I spend 1,000 of dollars",4
"I love this game, the story is solid, the characters are fun, and especially for mobile the art is genuinely good. It‚Äôs certainly imperfect and grinding in this game is a little below grueling at times, however it‚Äôs still balanced and in the end it‚Äôs still been less than a week. These few issues are fixable in the likely long time this game will be updated. I can‚Äôt wait to see where the developers take the story and the gameplay in the future. And by the way the music is incredibly fitting in the setting.",5
"I love this game to a T. Even when this is a very new game it makes me want to play it for years. I read the forums on the website with people complaining about it being slow or crashing. Well duh it‚Äôs a brand new game and there are over a 100 thousand people hopping on it at the same time so of course it‚Äôs going to have so many hiccups. For Genshin Impact, I‚Äôd be glad to wait a month or even a full year so I can play it properly with everybody not jumping on it at the same time. Having Patience for a beautiful game like this is truly worth it.",5
"I am enjoying the story, world art style, combat system, voice acting, cutscene animations and would gladly pay a full $60 + $20-30 for DLC to play this game in its entirety, but i just don‚Äôt see myself spending hundreds if not thousands of dollars on a gatcha game no matter how good it is. I highly recommend you play this game as it is very fun and AAA quality, just beware of the gotcha mechanics it revolves around. another note: some of the character art designs are hyper-sexualized which is why i‚Äôm taking out another star. I feel like the Devs could have taken it down a notch. Just be aware if you have younger children who are going to play this game.",3
"This game by far is the best game I‚Äôve played.
Though it has a massive download it‚Äôs worth it.
To those who are complaining about some of the games common dislikes.
It‚Äôs a wonderful game, it does have a rather large download but think about what the game would be like if the download was smaller. We wouldn‚Äôt have the same experience.
If your phone doesn‚Äôt have enough storage than sorry for your luck.
I play the game on an iPhone and I don‚Äôt use the phone for anything else. I‚Äôm aware of its costs so I used my brain.
Personally I don‚Äôt recommend downloading on androids other than a good quality Samsungs. (Don‚Äôt know what phone? Look it up)
 iPhones are great to download the game. They handle the game well.
If your phones lagging during gameplay and the phone can cook eggs, don‚Äôt risk.
Your WiFi, data, or phone can be the likely problem.",5
"I‚Äôve been playing for a little more than 2 years now and I‚Äôm in love with this game, and Zhongli. Fantastic game play, scenery, and while I‚Äôm not a f2p player, it‚Äôs almost no different than if you were to spend no money. There‚Äôs so many things to experience and quests to accomplish. Content does seem to run out the higher level you become, but Mihoyo is constantly adding more so it doesn‚Äôt really affect the game in the least! 10/10 definitely should play.",5
I have loved this game since I‚Äôve downloaded it and at first I had a problem with going through the quests so fast and then not having anything to play with. Now the quests are just filled with long storylines/dialogue that I don‚Äôt care about and quests are way too long. If they added a feature that could bring the genshin community closer (such as Pokemon-like raid battles) that would make co-op modes more fun instead of just using that for visiting other worlds. I also feel like there is so much potential with a game like this but it‚Äôs just sticking to the same old stuff.,3
"i would rate this a 10/5, but it takes up SO MUCH STORAGE. im AR 55 and it‚Äôs taking up 21 GB right now. i still play on my PC but i download and delete it on my phone just when i‚Äôm on my vacation. other than that, the game is amazing. the graphics are really good and the scenery is absolutely beautiful. yes, it‚Äôs a game made to spend money but i‚Äôm f2p and i‚Äôve loved this game for over a year now! i definitely recommend playing this game, bc it doesn‚Äôt take up alot of storage at the beginning, but if it does give u the notification, you can also play on PC and PS4/PS5!!",4
"It‚Äôs super fun to play! The character designs are also stunning, but I think Adventure rank 16 to play online is a little high, I think 10-14 would be better. And, there needs to be more quests, for example, adventure rank 15-18 (Where you can‚Äôt level up weapons and characters very high), you have pretty much only hard quests. All the dragonspine quests are super hard for anybody under adventure rank like 20-25 and you really can only do those ones, plus the other quests that aren‚Äôt super hard barely give any EXP. Apart from that it‚Äôs super entertaining!",4
"I am an OG player, so I‚Äôve been there for their first year, and this game has just Blown my mind. This game has so many bosses to fight, so many characters (with ABSOLUTELY AMAZING designs!) There skills are very powerful and so is their elemental burst!! This game has stole my heart and all of my friends that play this game! (If you‚Äôre reading this download this game because it‚Äôs amazing!!!)
I hope I will always come to love Genshin Impact and never turn away from it because all of the designs are beautiful!!",5
"I love genshin impact ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è it‚Äôs beautiful and it‚Äôs wonderful and it‚Äôs a fun game to play with friends! And the characters are absolutely gorgeous! They are so pretty! And there‚Äôs lots of magic and lots of adorable little critters! There so cute and if you love adventures and fighting and magic and adorable characters this is the game for you! I love this game so much and I always will my 
1# top favorite game!üíï there‚Äôs a huge map and lots to explore! And more adventures ahead so go go go and have a great time welcome to genshin impact the best game ever and the game for you!üíï",5
Overall the game is great and I enjoy playing it whenever I get the chance too. The only problem I has happened is for some reason a ruin door won‚Äôt open for me. I figured the issue is cause of the sudden lag that happened behind it and kicked me out of the game. After rejoining and going back to the same ruin it just won‚Äôt open even after using the needed characters. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to fix but if so it would be appreciated.,5
"So I‚Äôve been playing for almost two years now and I‚Äôve never had any clear problem thus far. However, there has been an underlying issue that‚Äôs been slowly creeping up on me as more and more versions are added to the game. That being the storage. Right now, Genshin takes up roughly 20 gb of my 64 gb phone. I‚Äôve heard rumors before of Hoyoverse adding a feature to uninstall unused or unneeded assets from the game, thus lowering the amount of data used, but I‚Äôve yet to see it actually put in place. It‚Äôs becoming a real issue for mobile players and I think it should be fixed soon.",3
At first i really liked the game! I was playing it for like 2 years i think? It was really fun at the start like new game new thing to do ya know but after a while it just get really boring and you start to feel like it‚Äôs kinda boring and a waste of money and not as fun as it used to be like every thing is the same and it‚Äôs so hard to get new characters and things and the events are all the same at this point and it just felt like the same thing over and over and they barely give you anything to get more charters to witch then you have to spend money and over all I don‚Äôt really like the game no more and really regret ever spending money on it.,2
"When playing the game I loved the atmosphere and colors. Along with the story and gameplay. But when it comes to huge amounts of updates that leave me not being able to play for hours. And also having to delete multiple apps off my phone to just be able to play until the NEXT update. 

I always hated this and with the developers would take it more slow for people with iPhone or and type of phone.

Not all of use have unlimited amounts of storage. That‚Äôs why I stopped playing after awhile.",4
"I have been playing Genshin for a while and I loved it at first but as I got into it I found out a lot of bad things they do, like making a black character in one of their othe games a stereotype, little micro aggressions being said to Xinyan in-game, her and Kaeya being white washed, and with the recent leaks of the Sumeru characters it‚Äôs very disappointing how the characters are pretty much white when this is supposed to be inspired by the Middle East and North Africa. Some I‚Äôve the designs were also very orientalist and stereotypical very poorly made and had cultures who had both to do with it mixed into the design. I stopped playing a few months ago because I was burnt out and it got repetitive and boring, so yeah‚Ä¶",1
"I love this game and play it basically everyday, but it takes up way to much space on my phone. The reason I‚Äôm able to play so much is because it‚Äôs right at my fingertips, but at the moment it takes up about 26GB in my phone, while my other games take up 4GB max. And I know that I can just download it on the computer, buy I know for a fact that I would have play it way less. I know next to nothing about making a game, but it would be great if there was a way to shrink down the size.",4
"With the new-coming Sumeru update, I was really hoping that we would get some well-needed representation. In the most recent livestream, we got a sneak peak for a long awaited country that is meant to be inspired by Middle Eastern and South Asian culture. In the footage, all we got to see were pasty pale people. I‚Äôm not saying that pale people don‚Äôt exist in these places, but having an entire country based on a culture of people who often have darker skin, and not showing that representation is horrible. In recent surveys, they asked us what we would wish to see in Sumeru, many people replying that more variety in skin color would be welcome and wished for. It‚Äôs not as if we haven‚Äôt asked. I truly love this game but it is wrong that the only representation is Xinyan.",1
"Loved the idea to be able to play everywhere and carry my progress but since April the game started stuttering like crazy on my iPad Air 2019, now I tried comeback on my iPhone 12 and is even worst on my phone newer than my iPad and said smooth load and it stutters like crazy everything low, not charging and just the game open, after downloading almost 8 to 10 gb is very disappointing, like I said the game is amazing but performance have been going downhill every time I log in, On Pc game run smooth as butter. I wish I can play it again on phone cause I don‚Äôt have that much time to play on pc.",3
"I love Genshin Impact. Like a lot.. but the storage room that its taking up is too much. I understand its for updates but this is possibly one of the reason why most players have to delete the app ( because how much storage they take in.) Im not sure if its because for MIHOYO (or the new name of the company that i forgot)  to update game its required to again take up storage space, but really what I would like if its decrease to a lower storage space its taking up. But besides of the storage space thing, I would rate this game 5/5 if we ignore the issue.",4
"Dear miHo Yo, I hope you are doing well, as part of the Genshin effect community, we would like to ask you to add Arabic to the game languages ‚Äã‚Äãso that we can all enjoy the game story with Arabic subtitles and it will be easy for a large number of people to understand and play the game because we loved  Your game and we spend a lot of time playing it, it will be a good opportunity for those who left the game because of their lack of understanding to let them give the effect of Genshin another chance Greetings",5
"This game is somewhat f2p friendly, you can beat the whole game with just the starter characters, the graphics are great, if you‚Äôre not running low on storage and ping, the wishing is actually very addicting, despite how much you have to work to get fates to wish, but the characters look great. Of course, I did mention some downsides in the text above, but the game is great! Another downside is that some of the fandom is kind of toxic, and it‚Äôs kind of like Gacha Life or Cookie Run Kingdom, everyone hates those fandoms for some reason.",5
"This game is amazing, from the characters, all the way to storyline! Sure the gacha is annoying, with 50/50s, 90 hard pity, etc., but this is amazing! The only thing I suggest is make it a bit more f2p and new player friendly. Lots of characters are coming out, and most are from inazuma, which is very far into story. So it‚Äôs hard for new players. I started at the end of Ayaka banner, and so I had to grind story, because I really liked Yoimiya and got her. So I had to grind, to get to inazuma for her materials. It‚Äôs hard.",5
"As you have red the title. I have suggestions 1st: Make a new character like yaoyao As a free 4 star character. (I know lantern rite has a free character option but you need to earn tasks for it)

2nd: Make aloy a buff so People dont usaslly ignore her.. 
3rd: new chat system and stickers! I love using stickers so much! but im pretty bored with the ones already released... soo.. I'd like more Stickers! like yae miko.. itto.. raiden.. kokomi Etc!
4th more Maps! I really like exploring so i want new maps! chasm hasnt been released yet... AND IM REALLY EXCITED FOR MORE PRIMOGEMS!!! -Yun ^Genshin Suggestions^",5
"I‚Äôm to invested in this game so now I love it every day I come home and think day ok like to get my 60 primos. I used to be F2p but now I have spent 65$ on this game and I don‚Äôt regret it I love the characters and the story line, the hang out events. EVERYTHING CHEFS KISS MUAH amazing. Even though you don‚Äôt listen to us very often you know how to make thirst traps for us. Also make Childe on the standard banner I wouldn‚Äôt mind losing my 50/50 to him. In fact I probably would like that more than the character I wanted to get.",5
I got this game about 4 months ago yet I haven't been playing consistently. It‚Äôs super fun and I personally don't believe there‚Äôs anything wrong the with the actual game. Yet I‚Äôve had this glitch multiple times were when it tells my I have to update it and then it never fully updates and restarts I don‚Äôt know you it‚Äôs just a problem I have or if it‚Äôs a glitch but if it is please fix this! Other than that this is an incredible games and I 100 percent recommend!,5
if you are going to download this game and keep playing for months and months i really suggest you don‚Äôt play on mobile it literally destroys ur phone because it is taking so much space you won‚Äôt be able to take pictures or download or even keep texts. It is such a great game and i understand why it takes so much space because trust me the quality is amazing even on mobile. But please please try and balance it out with ur other apps or if u are already using a lot of space because it will make ur phone so slow. but anyways i love the game,3
I think this game is awesome it looks so real and I love how the characters are different from each other I really recommend this  but there is something keeping me a little down about this game and that is how you need real money to get new characters I now it not much to be sad about but I love  the Characters and I really want to add some to my team  but aside from that think this game is lovely and I now the creator really work hard on it and I do not want to complain and make them to do more work  I hope the creators are proud of there work .,4
"hello just wanted to tell you that i think the game is awesome! awesome graphics, story, everything. but there's one thing.. is how much storage it takes. the new 2.3 update has messed up my iPad and now i can't update it, no matter how many apps i delete, i just can't update it. which means i can't play it anymore, so please either fix this or if you can't then it's okay i understand! this was my favorite game of all time, i love all the characters and was super excited for gorou, but guess i won't be getting him (; (i even paid for this game, i used a lot of money that now just went to waste)",3
"I absolutely love this game, I play it religiously every day without fail, but I wish I was able to play it on my work laptop which is a MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs great that I‚Äôm able to play on my phone, but it kills my battery way too fast, and I‚Äôm not always able to play on my ps4, so to be able to take it with me on my macbook would be really efficient. It would also open up opportunities to increase the player-base even more since there are people who can‚Äôt afford the storage or the devices to be able to play, whilst only having a macbook accessible. So please make it mac compatible‚Ä¶",3
"okay so let‚Äôs be real, it takes up HELLAA storage so i recommend getting it on a pc or smth unless u have a lot of GB on mobile

and its also really annoying seeing ppl give bad reviews cos they didn‚Äôt get a character they wanted like honestly bru it‚Äôs a gacha game u can‚Äôt get what u want all the time

there‚Äôs one more issue (the game is great get me wrong) : i used to play on mobile but i switched to pc, and i try to buy things but it says i have to buy it on the device i made the acc on which made me mad sjkshdjfn because i have to delete all of my apps just to get the game again which ik I could just not buy stuff but i want my 90 primos everyday;( anyways yeah so recently i haven‚Äôt been able to buy anything bc of this and it‚Äôs rly annoying (also i usually never buy genesis crystals i just get the 90 daily primos) 

but yeah the game is REALLYY pretty and i love the world:) the characters r super pretty and just all of the designs are rly swag

the story is also great and most of the events are cool (i could keep going on abt the stuff i like about the game but i don‚Äôt wanna keep typing so im done)",1
"Genshin Impact is absolutely amazing and just a fun game to play but There are times where The game isn‚Äôt even fun and just stressful, The Game rewards for completing task sometimes are a little under rewarding For example ‚ÄúIn the mountains quest‚Äù I‚Äôve realized a lot of people feel the same way There how many different scenarios just like this were asked to the game would add a puzzle to say to unlock a domain , of course sometimes the game wouldn‚Äôt even give you hints or how to solve the puzzle. Besides that This game has it‚Äôs enjoyable moments I really do think this game is great! :)",4
"Hey so, this is my like 8th attempt to leave a review but it keeps getting mysteriously deleted so I‚Äôm leaving another one that‚Äôs a lovely resumeüôÇ(tried w 2*, still got deleted ü§°) 
 To be fully honest, even though rewards are absolutely awful, I think this was just the last drop and NOT the full issue. Just please listen to the community, you guys have promised so much but delivered so little (look at for example the KFC glider, switch port, 1 mil subs reward from yt, Those are a few that come to mind rn) and as soon as people voice their concerns they get censored or dog piled by white knights. Face your fans Miyoho, this is still salvageable right now and sending what was meant to be a $30 package‚Äôs parts aren‚Äôt gonna fix it.",1
"clearly aimed to take advantage of vulnerable people financially and is VERY addicting. the banners go by so fast and you almost never can get chrs unless you‚Äôre super lucky, spend months preparing, or pay money, but when you do that, you miss out on other banners, which may make you spend more money impulsively.

the combat is fun, a lot of the chr designs are quite pretty, but i wouldn‚Äôt recommend this personally.

also the fact there is pedophiles in the game too‚Äî that is also bad. the character lisa is shown being weird with the main character, who is stated to be underage or at very least under drinking age, which can vary‚Äî but they‚Äôre clearly intended to be ~16 and it is extremely uncomfortable to watch and they even give you dialogue options to flirt back. it‚Äôs just in general extremely uncomfortable.

my recommendation is: if you really wanna play this, don‚Äôt spend money. just don‚Äôt give money to this company or whatnot. be f2p, it‚Äôs annoying because the droprates are incredibly scammy, but it‚Äôs possible. and if you feel you will be impulsive with money‚Äî definitely don‚Äôt play this",1
"I really didn‚Äôt think you could get any lower, and lo and behold. No decent optimization for lower-end devices, horrible rewards for F2P players, a disgusting gacha system; what else? Ah, right, the ANNIVERSARY. The way you treat your players during the game‚Äôs anniversary is garbage. These rewards are pathetic; the fact that people have to spend so much money just for the character they want is absolutely absurd. The fact that you have to pressure every player to log in every day and do such tedious commissions is even worse. If not done, the lost Primos start to build up, especially with how HORRIBLE the gacha system is.

Learn from this, Mihoyo. Look at how Dragalia is doing. Look at how Cookie Run is doing. You need to revamp the game if you want players to be satisfied. Oh, and while I‚Äôm at it? FIX THE MISTRANSLATIONS. I‚Äôm tired of seeing controversy over mistranslations every other week, and no, this isn‚Äôt just about the relationship between Kaeya and Diluc. 

Honestly, I‚Äôm planning on abandoning this game for good if this doesn‚Äôt fix itself. I once saw this as a masterpiece, but I was fooled. This is actual garbage. 

Goodnight.",1
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since December, during Albedo‚Äôs banner, and oh my god. It‚Äôs beautiful. You get amazing graphics, characters, adventures, and more all within a free to play game. Of course, you can choose to spend money on here, but you‚Äôre always guaranteed a high lvl (that‚Äôs 5 star for our genshin friends) character when you roll 70-90 times. Which seems like a lot, but it adds up! This game is one of the few games to have ever made me cry, and I‚Äôm invested in the story line. Play this game if you haven‚Äôt yet!",5
"I‚Äôve heard amazing things about this game, which is why I got it in the first place.

I played the demo to see how I‚Äôd like it, and I loved it! It‚Äôs amazing, the story is intriguing, and the gameplay is just stunning!

When the demo ended I went to download the full version, and was met with a disappointment. It said I had ‚Äútoo little storage space‚Äù, which I checked my storage, deleted some things, etc. When I was done I went to try again, and since I knew I had enough storage space I was excited to keep playing.

However it still said ‚Äúinsignificant storage space‚Äù no matter what I did. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch, or a bug, or something else, but it bummed me out, since I was very excited to play the full game.

If this can be fixed somehow I suggest it is, as when researching how to fix it, I found that I wasn‚Äôt the only one who experienced this problem.",4
"It‚Äôs interesting and I probably would‚Äôve loved it even more had I started playing once the storyline was complete but i‚Äôm so used to grinding to level up that the storyline has gotten boring to me personally. On a normal day i‚Äôll probably just get online do some world quest, defeat the bosses, do my commissions, redeem codes if any, and maybe play a bit of the storyline. The new update is pretty cool though and now i‚Äôm more interested than ever!! Very excited for the rest of the archons to appear. I recommend playing this game but please don‚Äôt rush through and take your time! :)",4
"genshin impact took a big part of my life, as to where i was almost addicted. this game is amazing!! i definitely recommend it. updates come out very consistently, miHoYo is doing an absolute great job so far. this is an open world game with a vast majority of things you can do. you can do gacha pulls for your favorite characters, farm materials, collect materials, do quests, etc. this game also has an amazing storyline and character designs. look into the world of teyvat, and i can assure you that you will adore it.",5
"I have an iPad mini 2 and it says my device it‚Äôs compatible with the game, so I install it, I download the data but when I start the game it just shut down and kick me from the game, idk if it‚Äôs because my tablet it‚Äôs an old model, I don‚Äôt know if this can be cause i read the list of compatibility and the iPad mini 2 is there and also it says that it runs on iOS 12 and that‚Äôs the one I have, so please can I have an answer of what‚Äôs the problem cause I really wanna play it here cause the screen is bigger and it will be easier",4
"For some reason no matter what network I‚Äôm connected to, whether it‚Äôs Internet or just a VPN or anything it always says ‚Äú there is an issue with your network‚Äù now it could be the restrictions on this device which I‚Äôm using, and the Devs might not be able to fix it, but if there is anyone you can do then please tell me. I‚Äôm giving this Game five stars because so many people love it and I don‚Äôt want to weigh the rating down just because of my devices problem.",5
"I‚Äôve been looking for an RPG to have on my mobile for a while...and it‚Äôs true what they say...true love comes when least expect it. I was not expecting to truly fall in love with this game. The graphics are amazing, the storyline is amazing, and the controls are pretty great too! I‚Äôm not the best but I do enjoy playing..co op is pretty fun too I have no complaints about anything. This game is free no strings attached, just know you have to put in a lot of work if you aren‚Äôt paying for a thing or too but it‚Äôs totally okay.",5
"While I think it‚Äôs frustrating to have the five stars so rare, having a five star isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs required. Zhongli will hopefully be buffed enough so that he‚Äôs actually fun to play, and the characters and story and combat is very, very good! Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think that you can cross-save with PS4 yet, and I‚Äôm sure my phone is going to die once the later updates come out. It does have some visuals that are very obviously inspired by BotW, but it‚Äôs not a copy at all.

 I‚Äôm only giving four stars because I always believe there‚Äôs room for improvement and don‚Äôt really give five star reviews anyway.",4
"Ok starting out by saying this is one of the most fun mobile games I've ever played in my life, but this is also like. The least generous gacha too. The amount of primogems needed for wishes vs the amount f2p players can get in the open world without having to farm the Spiral Abyss is not sustainable/ doesn't add up to much unless you've been hoarding them for at least a few weeks. A suggestion would be to have daily login primogems all the time, not just during events? And somehow maybe like. Increasing the 5* appearance rates a bit because from what I remember the flat appearance rate right now is a 0.6%.",4
"This is my absolute favorite game right now. I‚Äôve been playing it nonstop because there‚Äôs always something to do and it keeps me so engaged 

I have less than 5 games on my phone because J have such a hard time finding one that keeps me interested but genshin impact does just that. I like how it‚Äôs free roam/open world because it opens up so many possibilities for your gameplay 

to anyone considering downloading, do it. I can almost guarantee you won‚Äôt regret it. So far I haven‚Äôt found a single flaw",5
Genshin Impact is a beautiful game. The world is so open and I constantly find new things every time I walk through it. The world feels so alive. The character designs are beautiful and the gameplay is fun. You don‚Äôt have to spend money in it to have a good time. Without spending money I have gotten most of the characters that I‚Äôve wanted and at some point I‚Äôm planning to spend some money to support the game and it‚Äôs developers. Overall just get the game it‚Äôs worth your time. Also my favorite characters are Venti and Emergency Food.,5
"One of the first gatcha games I've played that doesn‚Äôt constantly bombard you with sales. No clicking through endless announcements of bundles and specials designed to separate you from your money. In fact after the first week of playing I actually had to seek out the store to see what was in it, because it hadn‚Äôt come up one single time. Lots of fun though I will say, PC has better controls than mobile so if you have a choice to play it both ways I highly recommend doing that.",5
"So first thing don‚Äôt play this game unless you want to deal with this fandom. I will warn you that this fandom is full of crappy people. Secondly sumeru is so whitewashed and feels very racist!  I would also LOVE more co-op options because many people get up to ar60 and have nothing to do. It would be way better if you have co-op stuff like windtrace. I loved that event because it was so much co-op. However that‚Äôs just my opinion. For me, now it feels like a chore getting on everyday and most of the time I get on and get off. Over all love the story quests and archon quests. :)",4
"I downloaded this game yesterday because I‚Äôve been getting burnt out with my daily rotation games. After seeing an ad for this game, I started it because I was doubtful of its open world claims, but holy smokes I was very pleasantly surprised. There‚Äôs so much to do, explore, and learn; I‚Äôm not very far in yet but I currently love all of my characters and enjoy they each of them seem individualized. A minor but enjoyable point is the male characters have a softness to them that you don‚Äôt see in many anime-sque games. Quickly becoming one of my favs, been playing non-stop.",5
"I never write reviews, But Genshin Impact deserves one. It's incredible how this game is free-to-play. This game really does feel like you are in the game; you are on an adventure. The gameplay is fantastic; there is always something new to learn; you never get bored. The music soundtracks are just a blessing to your ears. I never felt so connected to a game; when you play, all your emotions, anxiety, thoughts on the real world disappear as you adventure through this game. I'm speechless!!! I'm so grateful I get to play this game. Thank you, MiHoYo, for creating this masterpiece. Much love!",5
"This game really defies what one has come to expect from a free title on the App Store. This game is absolutely incredible for being free. I‚Äôm about 10 hours in and am having a great time with the game, and haven‚Äôt had to pay any money for anything (We‚Äôll see if that lasts).

And while the game plays shockingly well with on-screen controls, the UI really muddies up what is otherwise a stunningly beautiful game. Seriously, this game looks bananas good, and will melt your mind (and battery) trying out the 60FPS option, it‚Äôs friggin amazing and showcases what a powerhouse mobile gaming has the capacity to be. 

It just needs controller support. Add that and the rating is an easy 5+ stars.",3
"I‚Äôm very impressed with this game. Its beautiful, the graphics are amazing for a free game, the designs are awesome, and the sheer size of the world and all the details blow my mind. Does it have issues? Yes but I like the game enough to not care, even if I‚Äôm mid battle and hit the wrong screen. 

The only problem that I have a problem with is that if you play as the boy twin, Paimon will still call you ‚Äòshe‚Äô before fighting Stormterror and that Kaeya will say ‚Äòprince‚Äô instead of ‚Äòprincess‚Äô audio wise right after. I also wish the chances of getting a character in a draw was higher...",5
"With a stupefyingly low Half-a-percent 5-star item/hero rate (yes, they mixed gear and units into the same pool), it's surprising how rabidly anti-rerolling the devs are. Add on top the fact they don't have any value packs for moderate spenders or beginner deals (i.e a $20 for a 5* pick ticket or something), it really shows that the devs are 500% pure greed. I highly recommend holding off in playing this until better deals are available. Unless you're prepared to drop $1000+ without any cause for concern, this game is likely not worth your long-term devotion. Play a bit to sate the curiosity, stay F2P, and leave when it gets boring",3
"So when I had downloaded the app on my phone I was so excited to play it but upon opening the game the graphic only showed up black like the sky wasn‚Äôt blue or anything just a big void of black, then I thought this problem was only on my phone but when I asked my sister to download the game as well the same problem occurred if there‚Äôs anyway to fix this problem I‚Äôd really appreciate it as I would like to enjoy this game to the fullest, thank you.",5
"I defended Genshin for a long time, in spite of being a gacha game. The plot was interesting, the characters were incredible. 

But with the recent release of Dehya, the game devs have shown that they‚Äôre getting lazy with characters. Dehya has one of the worst kits in game with multipliers that have minimal to no return on investment, he burst actively missing targets or canceling on jump, and the fact that she was put on standard once they realized she was a terrible design. 

I was frequently spending a significant amount of money but I‚Äôve decided that if this is the direction the devs are going I will no longer be wasting my money here. As much as I love the plot, it‚Äôs not worth supporting a team who chooses to releases unit who is a downgrade in every sense.",1
"By far my favorite game! I had it on my PS4 but I sadly lost that account because of my ps4 breaking but I decided to make a new account on my phone and this game never gets old! Love the variety of characters and quests. I never run out of things to do whether it be farming for level up materials, unlocking achievements, completing quests, or just exploring the regions. 10/10 I definitely recommend. Only downside is how much storage it takes up, but I get it. The graphics are great.",5
"Playing Genshin Impact was very exciting and entertaining. The game pulls you into Teyvat with creative characters and an immersive storyline. The artifacts and weapons are well thought out and fun to put together. The game also has beautiful art and graphics on top of that.  It is a challenge to collect primogems, the currency used to gain new characters and weapons however, so I would recommend saving them. Overall, Genshin is a wonderful example of an open world action RPG, and I would reccomend it to anyone interested.",5
"I like the game and have a lot of fun with it, but when trying to redeem codes or move an account to another device it can get difficult when using apples Game Center. Genshin and Mihoyo‚Äôs other various websites don‚Äôt seem to recognize the information when it is put In manually instead of done through automatic Game Center login. This doesn‚Äôt take away for gameplay it just makes things difficult outside of the game. Please fix this I would like to give a 5 star review for great content and graphics but this holds it back",4
"As a mobile player who dosent get the BEST graphics still can enjoy the beauty of the game. I feel like I could play it all day.. like, completing my daily commissions, using my daily resin, doing story quest, using my key things to unlock hangout events and hanging out in co-op with other people. I‚Äôve met a lot I‚Äôve kind people on here. I love this game so much if it wasn‚Äôt for this game I would‚Äôve been dying of boredom thank you, to the creators of genshin for you amazing hard work that definitely payed off.",5
"This game is so fun! The graphics are fantastic and there‚Äôs so much to do. Sadly the lag is real and very serious. Sometimes I can‚Äôt open certain menus when it glitches. I also think some cheats like cheating ascension should be fixed, because I cheated ascension I can‚Äôt enjoy the game as much when enemies are too strong for me. Genshin Impact is still too fun to stop playing! There‚Äôs always an event or new characters to explore. I suggest this game for people who love mystery and adventure with a sprinkle of free roaming. I hope everyone can get a similar experience to what I had!",4
"I have been playing this game on a daily
basis for over a year, so it's clear the game
has a lot to offer and has been a good
overall experience. However, there's an
issue that has been there since the
beginning and has become increasingly
prevalent as of lately, I am referring to the
lack of skin tone diversity in this game, with
50 released characters so far and only 2
being slightly tanner than the off-white color
of the majority. Fans have been bringing this
issue up for almost 2 years only to be met
with no changes from Hoyoverse. The
company hasn't even acknowledged this
issue, let alone actually make changes to
benefit the game. Aside from this being
incredibly problematic, it's just bad from a
game developer standpoint to not actively
listen to and communicate with your player
base about relevant issues.",5
Ngl when I say I play this every single day this is so addictive üòç I‚Äôm a beginner just started Genshin A few weeks ago the only thing I regret is accidentally pulling a banner For beginners but it‚Äôs alright even though it‚Äôs kinda like Zelda breath of the wild It‚Äôs an improvement Love the Characters I haven‚Äôt had any problem except Missing an event which is on me cause I didn‚Äôt read the message properly but other this is perfect I haven‚Äôt had any glitch No freezing an no problems This app is perfectü§©,5
When I first started playing I was floored by how pretty and cohesive the game was. With immersive and entertaining stories and hours of gameplay it was wonderful! Though now that I have played for almost a year I have to wait for events to have anything to do. That being said the distinct lack of representation of other cultures and people is annoying and honestly people have asked for more rep for almost a year now and have been blatantly ignored. It‚Äôs aggravating.,5
I have been playing Genshin for almost a year and a half at this point and I have seen the game continue to grow and develop some amazing things. One thing I have no seen an improvement on is how well they handle skin tones and diversity in this game. You have so many global Genshin players from diverse background and wanna show that but you have only given up two characters who aren‚Äôt different shades of white. Hyoverse the Genshin community is really disappointed and outright mad seeing as we expected sumeru to be full with people of different skin colors yet from that preview in the livestream we saw nothing but pure yt colored skin. Do better as a community and give more representation since you know how important it it with yunjin.,1
"The game is really fun to play- until you get to a certain point. After reaching around AR 50, there‚Äôs not much to do other than grind and complete spiral abyss. I enjoy seeing new characters come out as much as anyone else, but with nothing to do with those characters other than get the best possible artifacts, the game starts to lose its sparkle.

While on the topic of new characters, it‚Äôs starting to get distressing with how little diversity in characters there is, especially with skin tones. 

I still enjoy playing every day, but most of my time is spent fishing due to lack of available content.",3
"this game and its developers. where do i even start. The two characters with even a bit of melanin, Kaeya and Xinyan are whitewashed multiple times in their official arts. Xinyan is a whole stereotype. In Honkai, there is a black girl who says she feels so dark when she looks like she just got a tan at the beach. A character with a darker skin tone that they made in a game that i believe hasn‚Äôt even come out yet was whitewashed in official art as well. And in Sumeru, a region based off Southern Asia has the majority of white characters who are Asian. This shows how racist this company can be and it makes me sick with how they show their representation. Out of all the Sumeru characters, i believe only two are going to be darker skinned. Don‚Äôt spend money on this game, honestly.",1
"Genshin impact is such a beautiful game with amazing character designs. My issue with this company though is that representation is not apparent in the game at all. There are only two poc out of the at least 50ish playable characters, and news weve heard of for the upcoming sumeru region has continued this trend of not being inclusive of certain areas of the culture. Sumeru is based off places like Egypt and Mesopotamia, and yet news we‚Äôve seen hasn‚Äôt shown any poc. Every character has been paper white, which doesn‚Äôt make sense. Even characters like beidou, who is a pirate who sails and conquers the sea is paper white. This is unacceptable if hoyoverse wants an international audience. I will not be spending money on this game until this problem is resolved.",1
I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this game but am unfortunately limited as a mobile player. I think this 2.7 update will be the last time I‚Äôll be able to play since there‚Äôs no way my phone has enough storage space for another download and and I so far see no other solution that waiting for them to finally release a version for the Nintendo switch or investing money I currently don‚Äôt have into a new computer. Again I love this game but I wish there was a solution to the storage issue!,4
"Genshin impact is a amazing game that you can play on all devices. And it‚Äôs one of the few Mobil games that dose not have adds. The story character designs and map are all amazing. It‚Äôs am
AMazing how each character have their own personality. But their are a few problems. 1 is genshin dose not listen to the players and are money hungry and aren‚Äôt giving players very much primo gems and they don‚Äôt care about f2p players. But the game itself I don‚Äôt have any problems with. It‚Äôs just the developers",5
"This game is addicting and I never get bored of it, deleting it is not even on my mind! It‚Äôs free to play friend,y and gives a generous amount of words and has plenty of fun characters who are ALL good with the right artifacts! Tons of stories, domains, and chests to unlock! You never run out of things to do! I‚Äôve been playing since August and I‚Äôm still not done with my exploring! Not just that but we only have 3/7 nations which means way more content to be added! UPDATEEEE SO TOU ALWAYS NEED A SLARE DEVICE BECAUSE DANG THIS TAKES UP A LOT",5
I love this game the gameplay is cool and the characters are amazing the different places to go are beautiful and the story is very interesting but each update the demand for more space is always a problem I‚Äôm running out of space and worried I won‚Äôt be able to play any more is there anyway that there could be a reduction to how much space it takes Genshin Impact is bound to be my only app because of how much space it takes up I would love to keep playing but these updates keeping coming with larger amounts of space needed.,4
"The game is fun, IF you have a good WiFi connection and a later iPhone model. However, poor WiFi and a 4 year-old model for iPhone 6sPlus are NOT a good pair for this game. It lags every other second, freezes up during EVERY cutscene, and shuts it‚Äôs self off the moment after I‚Äôve logged on. 
(It‚Äôs the same for my computer as well. I‚Äôve already freed up plenty of space on both devices to allow the game to run smoothly, but the Lagging and Freezing continues.)",5
"I loved this game! The graphics were amazing as was the gameplay and overall design! The only thing is, I didn‚Äôt get past the demo because the app said I had to free up storage on my phone, and I did. I freed up 10 gigabytes and it still said that I couldn‚Äôt continue. That‚Äôs the only thing that I found as a bummer, cause I was really excited to play this game. Unsure if this was a problem with my phone or a problem with the app, but that‚Äôs my input. But this game is amazing!!",5
"Honestly, Genshin Impact is probably one of the most amazing games i‚Äôve played! The characters, voice lines, graphics and soundtracks are all so detailed. 

Wishing for characters is pretty F2P friendly, you just have to grind for a few days. ‚ú®

I have a few suggestions though, if it isnt too much of a trouble

- WindBlume Festival 
This Event was pretty old, but there were so many players that missed this event and wanted a chance to try it out! I‚Äôve seen tons of people miss our little Tone-Deaf Bard, and were super happy to see him come out of MiHoYo‚Äôs Basement and the Irodori Festival. 
If you cant bring the WindBlume Festival back‚Ä¶ How about the Ludi Harpastum from the Webtoon? I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd all love to see an event from the lore, it‚Äôd be great!

Okay so I may or may not have just forgotten my other suggestions.. haha~

But that‚Äôs all i can say for now. Keep up the good work, MiHoYo! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I have no motivation for genshin im tired of major walls of texts and 10 minutes of spamming a button to get through completely irrelevant dialogue, like cool you have story, but show me through gameplay not text walls.
 Another thing it feels completely awful to spend 2 hours of my day fight bosses for a character im not even gonna get because im going to lose my next 50/50 and i cant get gaurnteed because im broke.
 their is a reason im playing a free game i miss how genshin used to be in the early lyue days also, double banner is cool in concept but i hate having to choose between a new character and someone ive wanted for ages, you had something good going but I think your getting greedy for cash",1
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since a little after release and it‚Äôs been my favorite game i‚Äôve ever played, i absolutely LOVE it so much but there‚Äôs been a very big on going issue. Accounts have been getting hacked way more than they should be. I can‚Äôt even play the game anymore because i‚Äôm still waiting for my account to be recovered but I made a new one in the meantime to still keep up and THAT account got hacked so yeah they need to fix this issue people are hacking and selling accounts online and it‚Äôs an issue ://",4
Your game is very good yes but as hard as we try we can never get a good amount of primos but you guys have been giving them out yes but not enough not to be greedy we work hard and you give us 300 primos that gives us 2-3 wishes most likely to give us the same weapon over again it‚Äôs also really hard to win 50/50 like I said we get the same characters over and over not a problem but sometimes annoying and the game cookie run kingdom that people also play is also hard to get cookies but the thing is they still give out diamonds to use for it to get them I suggest you guys give out more primos and maybe free ten pulls before half the players get un interested in the game.,1
"Hello! I love the game so much I love everything about it except 2 things! 1. I know this is definitely a lot too ask for but can you please make an option for ""AR assention quest off or on"" it is so hard to do them and it will take me months. And 2nd. I keep getting the same characters like just now I wishes and was so excited but it was a character I already have an I am a kind of new player. I and possibly a lot of people would appreciate it if u could change those things! Thank you if you do and if you don't, oh well.",4
"Genshin impact is one of the first mobile games that I haven‚Äôt rage deleted after a hard fight! It really pushes you to get better and try again. The graphics and character designs are absolutely magically, in more ways than what meets the eye. Every time you look, you see something different. It‚Äôs such a motivating and captivating game, and free! I am a FTP player (not by choice) and it works with little catches or restrictions. Truly my favorite app game of the year, and most likely for years to come. üòéüòéüòé",5
"As someone who‚Äôs been playing about a year, and who has spent probably over $300 on the game, it‚Äôs the best i‚Äôve ever played. i‚Äôve been gaming my whole life and this is the best one i‚Äôve ever encountered. if you‚Äôre debating playing, you absolutely should. and if you‚Äôre a concerned parent desperately looking through reviews to see if it‚Äôs violent or not, it‚Äôs not. there is fighting but it‚Äôs fighting mythical creatures and there is no blood, no gore, etc,. this is a good family friendly game that your child will enjoy.",5
"I absolutely live this game don‚Äôt get me wrong but the updates have been weird and some of the events don‚Äôt work at least for me and my other friends that play and I would say that‚Äôs my only problem with the game. I honestly love all the things you can do in this game but it can be a pain when it doesn‚Äôt work. I like that it never get boring there is ALWAYS something you can do (which I love) I recommend this game it is absolutely amazing and the story line is even better. 
Anyways just hope some of the things can be fixed and hope everyone love this game as much as I do.",3
"i love the game itself other then a few minor things, but what really killed me was the storage and the slow game. when i first got it, it was fine, but after a few weeks it slowed down only letting me play for 30 minutes max. this had nothing to do with my storage, i hadliterally  deleted every other app so that there was enough storage for this app. and it turns out that this app is not 3.2 GB, it‚Äôs as of now 13.3 GB. now, i play for 10 minutes, or maybe just a few seconds, and it kicks me out. recently it loads and right before it lets me into the game, it kicks me out. i am getting really tired of this crap, if it keeps up i‚Äôm definitely deleting the app. it really isn‚Äôt worth it.",1
"This game has really affected my life but for the better, i‚Äôve met many kind and helpful people through this game who can help you with enemies/bosses/domains/etc. Not to mention the storyline for this game is BEAUTIFUL. I‚Äôve gotten my friends to play this game, and at first they say ‚Äúeww it looks so bad, is that a knockoff version of zelda?‚Äù but then i tell them to wait for the good storyline and once they get to it, they are utterly OBSESSED with the game. I highly recommend this game if you would like to meet kind people in your free time.",5
"I love this game so much, the characters, the designs and the plot. But people need to be more grateful a lot of people who play this game is always mad about not getting free stuff which is really stupid, I think that this game is really generous!! If you haven't downloaded the game yet I really recommend it's so fun and theres always something to do it's like having a whole magical world to explore also today is a anniversary so happy anniversary mihyo!! This game is a definite escape from reality and so fun to play so join right now!!",5
"Genshin Impact‚Äôs gameplay is fun, but it has a few major flaws.
1. Genshin Impact has terrible rates. There is a six percent chance to get a five star. You may argue that you can complete the game without five stars, but it is really hard. Look at other gacha games, their rates are much better than Genshin Impact‚Äôs rates.
2. Terrible anniversary rewards. You can only get ten pulls from the daily anniversary rewards. TEN. ONLY TEN. Many other gacha games give way more pulls on their anniversary.
In conclusion, Genshin Impact‚Äôs gacha has terrible rates compared to other games and has such bad rewards that I‚Äôd rather want to dig a hole and fill it back up for the rest of my life than claim the anniversary rewards.",2
"the game over ALL is pretty good. nice visuals, good character designs, etc. but the rewards players get- ESPECIALLY if theyve been playing for a long time are lackluster.  open the game, do your commissions, spend your resin, send expeditions, repeat.  you pay so much and get so little, the welkin package is basically the only good thing. the rewards aren't the best- you get more for bug repairs and maintenance than the FIRST ANNIVERSARY, which is a cheaply crafted web event to get people to advertise their game.  the company is endlessly greedy, so unless you're willing to drop hundred of dollars to get what you want, or have insanely good luck, this isn't the game for you. heavy grinding that takes ages, gacha rates that spit in your face, and a broken resin system and artifact harvesting",1
"I am in love with this game, but I don‚Äôt play it much due to how much it lags me and the poor graphic quality. Whenever I touch something from the GUI it takes 5 minutes or more for the actual thing to pop up, and sometimes whenever I reach a quest point or something the character isn‚Äôt there because of the graphics, Most of the time the graphics don‚Äôt even load! When I try to turn the graphics up it lags me out immediately, once it lagged me out when I was making a wish, that was a waste of a wish! Please make this game better for the people with older devices, laggy devices etcetera, I would play much more if this was fixed. Oh and by the way this  takes up too much storage",1
"Genshin Impact is a very pretty game with great exploration, music, characters, etc. It is very fun for a few months but there is a noticeable lack of endgame repeatable content. Spiral abyss resets every two weeks and does not take much time to clear. Eventually the gameplay is reduced to just logging in, spending resin and doing commissions, and logging off. This problem is somewhat negated by events, but it is still a bit of a problem. Overall, I think it is still a pretty solid game, especially since a lot of new content is coming in 2.0",4
"So when I saw a ton of people playing this game I thought that I would give it a try. So I downloaded it and made an account. But the problem started when I pressed play to start the game. It gave me a loading screen then told me I don‚Äôt have enough storage on my device to update it. This is where it got really confusing because I am playing on a brand new ipad with 256GB of storage. I pressed retry over and over again but it still wouldn‚Äôt work. So I was thinking how much storage does this app need? I have only used 32GB and it still did not work. 
     It was kinda a let down and I was really excited to play this game. So just a not if you don‚Äôt have a lot of storage do not get this game!",1
Genshin impact is really fun to play. I love the fantasy aspect of it and the designs but I have a complaint that I think should be fixed. Although it is a great game it lags wait too much. Some parts don‚Äôt load properly and because this I‚Äôm not able to do some quests. Most of the time cut scenes and menus take a long time to load and once they do load my device crashes. I play on a phone so I feel like if you fix this problem it would the game or enjoyable for me and other people that play on mobile.,4
"I‚Äôm enjoying playing Genshin Impact. The game looks and sounds great. The touch controls are a little difficult at times and every device I play this on heats up very quickly (iPhone XR, 2018 iPad Pro, and the Samsung Galaxy S10e). The PS4 and PC versions have controller support, so I don‚Äôt see why the mobile version doesn‚Äôt. This game would be near perfect with controller support in my opinion, and I would rate it five stars if they added it. Hopefully they add controller support soon! A little optimization wouldn‚Äôt hurt either, but I can live with the performance if I could play the game with a controller.",4
Not for all looks like a great game and it‚Äôs my first time playing it and a Bestie request me to play it because she had no one to play with her..So she asked me if I can download it and I said yes she was happy and she doesn‚Äôt want to get to excited-üòÖ so yeah I would recommend some friends and family to play it after it it‚Äôs a good game! And funny my user in a app is called Gamer girl lol even tho I‚Äôm not a real gamer but really sure to play this game with my bestie everyday!,5
"This game is truly amazing from the story line the the map itself but i think something could make it even better.... THE ABILITY TO PLAY ON XBOX!!! I know the games already been released for PS and for while now too but many Xbox players are still hoping and waiting for this game to come onto Xbox. Please, Please, Please put this on Xbox. I‚Äôve been playing this game since it came out and i have no regrets on doing so. It‚Äôs an truly amazing game and i‚Äôm just hoping for it to come onto Xbox",5
"I don‚Äôt really like adventure games but this game kept on popping up everywhere so I finally decided to give it a try at first I wasn‚Äôt really digging it just like I said I don‚Äôt like adventure games or anything that has to deal with fighting but after a while kind of grew on me and I ended up falling in love this game so beautiful so detailed I don‚Äôt think we will ever have a game like this again so I plane to make the most of it. The only thing I wish for is to have pet dragons, I know it seems of but I feel like it would be a nice touch.",5
"This game is everything I could ever want in a game. (obviously minus the Gacha, but does this very well) For a free game you can‚Äôt ask for more really! It‚Äôs got the graphics, great gameplay, exploration, it‚Äôs all just top notch.  I really hope other developers are taking notes on how to make such a stellar game. Nintendo should be rethinking botw because this game blows it out of the water. The story at times can be convoluted, but for the most part still an amazing journey. Really loving the 1.2 update story so far and venti‚Äôs story has been one of my favorites! Keep it up!",5
"So uh I downloaded this because everyone was saying it‚Äôs so great and I kept seeing ads about it on pintrest. It seems like it would be really fun, but I‚Äôve never played it because I‚Äôve been experiencing some glitch or whatever it is. Basically I‚Äôll open the app, it will have a plain white screen for like a second, and then the bottom half of the screen turns dark grey for like 4 seconds, then it kicks me off the app ;-;. Am I supposed to be doing something or am I just glitched? I tried deleted and reinstalling the app and that worked long enough for me to make an account but now it‚Äôs back :P. Please send help I don‚Äôt know what to do lol-",3
"I‚Äôm going to keep this short and sweet. I thought this game was absolutely perfect before seeing the ‚ÄúBattle Pass‚Äù my face instantly cringed when I saw it. Before I thought it was a game that wasn‚Äôt a cash grab, but the battle pass makes me rethink this. It‚Äôs just my opinion as someone who doesn‚Äôt like dropping more then like $5 on a game. It was so great, not that this will be seen or even read...but could you maybe re-think that? (Not that you will) So much for, ‚Äúshort and sweet‚Äù.
 
Thank you developers for creating the best open world I‚Äôve seen so far, just please to ruin it by making it a cash grab.",4
I love this game BUT it doesn‚Äôt generate good on my tablet so I recommend playing this game on the ps4. I love it a lot its a really good adventure game plus the style is fantastic! The boss after the dragon is hard though. Its not right after the dragon fight but anyways the 2nd boss is LIGIT hard I could barely get any hits on it  plus it‚Äôs basically the hardest boss battle ever! Also it‚Äôs immune to a lot of your attacks so if you do a special move then you wasted that move because it doesn‚Äôt do barely any damage! Thank you for reading till the end and for your time. Enjoy!,5
"I‚Äôm not going to lie, this game is one of the very few games I have played for more than a day and not get bored but, when ever i go into the water it is just pitch black and it shines a very bright flashing light on my screen which lasts like 30 seconds. my other problem is, I don‚Äôt know if this is intended but, for some reason I have very limited vision in it, I have like a pitch black curcle around me which only let‚Äôs me see a little bit around me, I though this was supposed to be a open world game? 

Anyways, I love this game just that was a few problems! (Hope you respond devs)",4
"I bet this game looks really nice. And that it has an expansive open world. I am sure there are countless ways to enjoy this mobile open world RPG. The problem is after two attempts to download and install this 6+GB game, it still lags incredibly and won‚Äôt load any of the world textures, so my character is running around a barren black landscape. I would understand if this issue happened on an older iPhone that couldn‚Äôt handle the GPU load, but that isn‚Äôt the case here: I am using an iPad Pro. There is no reason a ‚Äúmobile‚Äù game can‚Äôt run on a top of the line product line that the app is supposedly designed for. Devs should head back to the drawing board and optimize their product a bit more. This isn‚Äôt a console game, stop designing it like it is.",1
"I love the game and it‚Äôs really fun u can explore a get characters and stuff like that but the Storage is the problem whenever the game needs to update it takes SO much but‚Ä¶.have deleted so much stuff because 
of the app like photos a stuff lots of apps that I enjoy I had to delete because of it also lots of bugs and glitches took forever to load at first but fun game 
Probably going to delete it now because it‚Äôs taking to much of the storage I recommend this game is u don‚Äôt have anything to do and u have ALOT of storage.",4
"I remember seeing this game and then seeing it‚Äôs file size. I have to admit it‚Äôs a pretty sizable app but it is definitely worth it. I have it on my iPad Pro and the graphics just look amazing. I haven‚Äôt seen any other game like this, open world and the ability to just do so many things and explore so many places. There are fun quests, different characters to play with, a storyline that I have yet to complete and more. Overall this game is a 5 star for me and I will recommend it to anyone who doesn‚Äôt mind using 8GB of their storage.",5
"i don‚Äôt know what i was expecting, but whatever it was, this game went above and beyond. gorgeous graphics, adorable and interesting characters with unique stories, endless amounts of land to explore, i could go on and on. i have absolutely 0 complaints about this game. i can‚Äôt get over how high quality it is. also, i love the climbing feature. that‚Äôs not something you see too often in these types of games. it was pure chance that i downloaded this game, thinking ‚Äúeh, maybe it‚Äôll keep me busy for 40 minutes or so‚Äù. i can play for hours and not get bored. i can‚Äôt get over the fact that it feels like i‚Äôm playing on an xbox or some system specifically designed for gaming. that‚Äôs how good this game looks/runs. i highly recommend this game. not a single thing is confusing, and you get the hang of it pretty quickly. i can‚Äôt give enough pride to genshin impact :)))",5
This game is very similar to breath of the wild but adds a little bit like the elements system which adds another layer to the very fun combat. The game is beautiful and the story keeps you interested. This game is basically a triple A game that is free to play. I have spent money on this game because I wanted to support the developers but it‚Äôs totally optional. Just try the game. It‚Äôs free and fun so you have nothing to lose. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll like it if you like open world games that give some guidance but let you do whatever you want.,5
"So before the glitch happened I was seeing only a little bit of the game but when the glitched happened after the first fight with the dragon my screened turned all black, I really want to enjoy playing the game but I can‚Äôt right now I‚Äôm on a iPad, I hope in the next update maybe you can add a thing that will allow u to change the quality of the game like I can make it low quality so I will be able to play but soon I hope I will be able to enjoy the game, please help the mobile players that all I ask for.",5
"As long as your device is powerful enough to play the game the game is amazing, plays like BoTW as the amount of freedoom you have. The only problem that most people might have is either the gacha, or the high system requirements. Just a heads up, the company have to allow people on iPhone 6 download the game because Apple doesn‚Äôt allow them to restrict by model and only by available iOS. Please, if you‚Äôre planning on playing this game and are reading this, get an iPhone 7 minimum or play on PC.",5
"So I have been wanting a new game,but one just like Genshin. One where u could explore,But fight monsters,and play multiplayer. But Genshin impact brought even more! With new Charcters for me to obtain and weapons to level up. For me to level up. I play this every day and it‚Äôs amazing. and I haven‚Äôt found a lot of glitches. The only glitch that repeats is when ur playing multiplayer and somone glitches in the ground. Wich is just funny! If u like games where u fight and explore to, download this game! U won‚Äôt regret it!",5
"To get it started with, I love the beginning quests and I loved how easy it was to level up AR but after a while the game gets quite boring after a certain point they try to add a few events to make it fun but the only parts that‚Äôs still kinda fun is the co op and also the gacha is fair it just takes a really long time for new characters to come out especially when you‚Äôve saved so long for the character that‚Äôs gonna come out and the characters just 12 days away for a inpatient person like me that‚Äôs tooo long üòÇ",4
"I may have only started this game a few days ago, but this game is beyond my expectations. Although I had to keep my phone on all night to get it to download. But I don't blame it for taking that long. It's a pretty big game in fact it literally takes up 4 GB of storage but I don't care cause this game is overly addicting. The graphics are fantastic and how the characters act with each other. Out of all honesty this is the second best game I've ever played. - A Anonymous Person.",5
"This game is one of my liking, I love open world games and this one hits the mark. I have been playing for hours and even though its laggy on my pc, I play it on my phone. This game has gotten me through what I say painful hours of boredom and discovering this game is the best thing to happen to me. Although as much fun as this game is, the thing I do not like is that it is repetitive like waiting on resin, or doing the same things over and over but I guess thats the meaning on grinding. Well, I enjoyed this wayy too much and will in the future.",4
"When I first saw the screenshots and the way the community acted about this game, I told myself immediately that this game was stupid and that no one actually enjoys it.  Eventually I was bored of every other game I had so I decided I would give this game a shot.  I was blown away. The game genuinely surprised me with the open world, the characters, and the overall feel of the game.  Happy I decided to give it a shot after being so negative about it despite never touching it at that time.",5
"I really like the game at first I quit Genshin Impact because I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be fun but then I got back onto it a few months ago and I have loved it nonstop by playing it every day on a daily basis and I have no complaints but the only complaint I have is, why is it so hard to get primo gems that‚Äôs all I got to whine about nothing else. Overall the game is amazing and graphics are awesome and I love the characters they‚Äôre amazing and overall I love the game so it‚Äôs a five out of five for me.",5
"I grinded for so long to be able to get to my archon quest leveled up everything, wished for weapons and characters got artifacts and I do 100 damage while the fatui and whopper flowers are doing 1000? And in top of that the flowers dont stop they just shoot ice and fire balls at you every second. I‚Äôve been trying to defeat them for hours I‚Äôve even ascended my characters and weapons and they‚Äôre still taking 300 damage. On top of ALL that you have to grind for everything. Like just let us play the game. And yea I know we will have to grind here and there but we have to for EVERYTHING. fix your game",3
"Hello First of all nice graphics and gameplay hardly any glitches. I have some complaints though HoyoVerse looks like it's on the verge of being Pay2Win there aren't enough events quests that give Primos. They are hard to get, you would have to play for months just to get a 10-pull. Most players should save everything they can until they are lv 15 then they can start getting more weapons/characters after that it would be extremely hard to get Primos",5
"An in-depth and content-filled mobile game marred by a predatory gacha system fueled by hype-up marketing campaigns to draw characters into the monetization. If you want to spend on this game, be prepared to sink entire paychecks to obtain the characters/items you want. That being said, it is entirely possible to have fun as a F2P player and get the gacha characters/weapons you want, but there are rng components that can invalidate the hard work grinding currency. 

If you‚Äôre prone to gambling addiction/impulsive microtransaction purchases, definitely stay away from this game. I can‚Äôt in good conscience recommend a game, no matter how much I enjoy it, when they contain monetization systems like this that encourage high spending.",2
"This game has been my favorite since the day I got it. Not only is the world super beautiful, but the characters, too. I love gacha games and Genshin is the best one I have played so far. There are so many aspects to this game that sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get bored of. This game is sort of a ‚Äúpay to win,‚Äù but honestly, not spending anything doesn‚Äôt make the game worse in any way, unless you would rather have more characters and things like that. One of the best games I have for sure!",5
"I like the game and all, but they need to add darker skin tones than the current ‚Äúdark‚Äù ones they have right now. They aren't even that dark it‚Äôs more like tan. Plus they whitewash their characters repeatedly it‚Äôs kinda sad tbh. I‚Äôm  really disappointed with Sumeru right now because they are supposed to be south asian, but they are really pale, and there‚Äôs barely representation for people with dark skin. I really think they could‚Äôve done better with lesser lord kusanali too. They really need to fix this or they are going to lose money. The darkest one is Candace, but she‚Äôs also like a tan..Candace was based off Kandake which is way darker than the skin tone they made her.  If they actually don‚Äôt add better rep then they are gonna lose a ton of players üíÄ",1
"The whole hoyoverse company is so stingy. They make so much money and give us nothing. All of us are giving them money and not even giving us any in return. The 1st anniversary awards made me quit the game for 3 months and force myself to play it out of boredom. I would like it for them to make the game more f2p friendly coming from someone who isn't even f2p. I would also like it if they would show more appreciation because they would not be where they are without us. We deserve somthing other than those giveaways that only one person can get, or those anniversary awards that were coming off as them trying to tell us that they just don't care anymore.",1
"The game has great mechanics and gameplay overall, but when it comes to characters and story it is LACKING. The characters are all pasty white even though they live in countries based on places like China, Japan, Egypt, Arabia, etc. There is not a single dark skin tone to be seen, and not only is it really boring it is sad for all the fans who are POC who don‚Äôt get to see representation of themselves. 

There is also the lack of body type representation when it comes to character designs- the biggest character is Itto who is a STRING BEAN when compared to his official art. All of the characters are unbelievably skinny. 

Hoyoverse, we want DIVERSITY. The character designs are all boring without it. We‚Äôre tired of pasty white and the poor excuses for ‚Äúdarker‚Äù skin tones.",1
Genshin why does it take up so much storage I had to delete 500+ photos and delete 15 apps then clear my catch and I pre downloaded something I just wanted to restart my progress and then you had to make it take up tons of space the only things I have left are 3 fun games and apps I actually need and baby photos and important photos I need you to explain to me why this takes up more space and to make it not take up so much space because I just wanna play a game I haven‚Äôt played in a while but this needs more storage and I can‚Äôt delete anything else nor buy more storage.,3
"The graphics and gameplay are really well made but the general fandom is really questionable, no fault to the creators. there is also a lack of diversity and underlying racism because in all of the 50 currently playable characters only two have darker skin and are often left out of the story or whitewashed in official arts. In the new sumeru teaser we get to see some new version of enemies, treasure hoarders, and they have the darkest skin currently. These problems seem like they aren‚Äôt that big of deal so far but it‚Äôs really gonna affect how players are gonna see the game and most likely stop playing.",3
"Don‚Äôt waste your time. At first they make it really fun. Then when you get both enough level it starts getting progressively harder with chain interrupts and a massive paywall to continue leveling unless you enjoy constant punishment for not sacrificing your credit card for level up materials. I had no problem spending money on it when it was fun, but now they‚Äôll never see another dime. I‚Äôll also avoid playing any game they make again knowing I‚Äôll just be sad after two weeks because the game I was enjoying so much has become extortion.  On top of that wishes are ridiculously expensive with awful drop rates.  I wish they‚Äôd keep these greedy mobile games here where they belong and off my PC.",1
"I played this game for a long time loved it and played it all day.I put so much time and effort and money into this game and then someone somehow Hacked my account.I was on the phone with apple for over a hour trying to stop this Hacker get more then just my account but my all my information he tried the whole time I was talking to apple.I emailed Genshin Impact to please help restore my profile and everything I lost that was months ago never even got a email or response back very upset and can‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt even help transfer my old data or something to my new email so upsetting I really loved this game and was a loyal customer,Thanks a lot for the help.",1
The only reason I‚Äôm writing this is because I want to talk to people who rated 1 star just because you lost 50/50 doesn‚Äôt mean you rage and rate the game one star also you get a guaranteed after so who knows if a even more powerful character comes out now you have a guaranteed chance also the reason why it keeps crashing on you is probably because of internet issues and storage issues so people stop complaining because of lost 50/50 and be a good sport,5
"I am sooo in love with this game. I suggested this game to so many people and all of them have loved it. The scenery is amazing, the combat isn‚Äôt too hard (excluding elemental reactions), and the characters are amazing. I started this game in November and now I am AR 50. I love how you can just take your time to do stuff instead of speed running everything like some games can. The ONLY downside is that the resin is capped to 160. PLEASE at least double it to 320. Anyways, I hope that this convinces you to download this :)",5
"Since roblox is down, I have been really bored. So one day, I was just looking through the App Store, and I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm downloading Genshin because why not‚Äù and it was amazing. Of course I told my friend about it, but she had problems with her storage. I recommend you take the full version. But I was a little confused at first when I was making an account, but it‚Äôs simple! As I already said, this is the best game ever, and I recommend it to anyone who likes adventure! üòÉ",5
I love this game so much i play it all the time with my older sister but there is one problem it always take‚Äôs up my storage like every time i play the game in one month or so i have to update it and whenever i try to update it it always says i don‚Äôt have enough storage so i have to delete apps and photo‚Äôs to make enough room  for this app overall 5/5 because if i don‚Äôt wanna play Roblox or something i play this game it is very entertaining and fun!,5
"I feel like it‚Äôs so hard just to get a single wish on the game. I have a friend who is F2P and they struggle with saving up. Every day you only have the chance to get 150 primos (Why not just make it 160 so we can at least have enough for one wish?) It would make saving up way easier for everyone. I feel like this IS. pay to win game, you barely give us primogems to wish for new characters and even so, the pity system makes it even harder. Why is hard pity 90 wishes and soft pity 75 wishes when we can barely get 5 wishes a week?",4
"I have been playing this game everyday for a year and i had a blast playing this game but, it‚Äôs so easy to lose motivation to play this game. The gacha rates are very bad and it‚Äôs hard to get your favorite character without spending money and since mihoyo does not have a roadmap of the order the banners are going to be in, it makes it harder to plan on how you want to spend your primogems. The current game state is pretty bad, once you hit ar50 or so, there is nothing to do besides commissions. The spiral abyss can be very unfair at times and overall i wish Mihoyo would take time to listen to what the community wants.",3
"I love genshin for several reasons 
1: great gameplay 
2: amazing story 
3: breath taking graphics
And much more.
That‚Äôs just to name a few but I could care less about the rewards or the events granted yes they are a nice addition and the rewards are nice but I‚Äôm here for what the game has to offer not the events or rewards and I‚Äôve been playing sense launch and I‚Äôve enjoyed every single second of the game and the story because that‚Äôs why I keep playing is because of the story and to continue leveling up my adventure rank and my character. So to me personally the whole entire hate towards the devs is a little childish, so what if the rewards weren‚Äôt that great just grow up and enjoy the game the way it was made because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be doing.
By the way Mihoyo you guys made an amazing game keep up the amazing work you guys are doing",5
"I like this game the open world experience and combat is overall fun and how you can build your characters is also fun but the main problem I have is the little amount of primo‚Äôs I get I try to do a lot of things for primo‚Äôs like unlock teleport stuff , achievements and the daily missions but I still can‚Äôt seem to get enough , also when I do domains I get really bad artifacts for my characters mainly defense stacks and hp at that‚Äôs it never crit rate/ damage or elemental bonuses so I really hope you can do something about both but if not it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs still fun but really time consuming",3
"This game is beautiful in several ways. The music, the characters, the gameplay, all of it. It‚Äôs diverse and free to play, yes you can pay money for the gacha system but it‚Äôs not required. It‚Äôs a great way to kill time and immerse yourself in a world of creativity.

As of right now, Mihoyo has only had Genshin Impact out for a year. So don‚Äôt expect such insane rewards when they‚Äôre just starting out. Please, before you listen to the critical reviews, give Genshin Impact a fair chance. :) !",5
"As said in the tittle, iPad 5 users in general encounter this bug where the login screens black, the freezing cutscenes , laggy gameplay.,Dark skies and minimal in game vision more often than not, I really do hope that devs are fixing this compatibility issue, cause ya know, this game is optimal for iPad users yet these bugs prevented us from having any fun at all. P.s I still can‚Äôt play this game just yet, and I‚Äôm very disappointed. I look forward to seeing an update soon, till then , I‚Äôll gladLy give rate this game 5 stars",4
"I have play this game for a while now and I have 10 pulled every time there is a new event banner since Hu Tao and I have only gotten one 5 star that I didn‚Äôt have. I got gold on ventis banner but got a 5 star I had already had. One think 80-90 to pull a 5 star is to high it should be about 60-70, Second i think you should get something better if you pull a duplicate 5 star character if you want , same with 4 stars but you get to pick the 4 you want unless you want the duplicate, third I think it should be easier to find materials. But other than that is love the game",3
It would be fun to have mounts to ride on like giant wolves(that can evolve as they level up) it would also be cool if they could fight along side the players. But horses and giant birds will be cool‚Ä¶. But i would say a dragon but that wouldn‚Äôt work bc of yk üò≠the dragon thing. It would also be cool to have your own house and have fishing rods for the players that joined to adventure* and i think they would enjoy collecting plants and catching fish of many types. Maybe add more creatures that would be cool and like ‚Äútame‚Äùthem.. also pets like cats and dogs..,5
"I don‚Äôt even like playing mobile games but this game has some how combined everything I like about video games all in one on my phone. I don‚Äôt feel pressured to keep playing and it‚Äôs a nice escape to play for 30-40 minutes whenever I can during my day. Highly recommend this if your into rpgs, open world games, anime, etc. Also the fact that it‚Äôs free with this much production value is something else I‚Äôd like to point out. I‚Äôd say give it a try and see what you think. I‚Äôd say you most likely will not be disappointed!",5
"Big fan of JRPGs here, love the Final Fantasy franchise and was going to download FF7 and FF9 on iPhkne again to relive the experience but this game caught my eye. After playing it for a while now I have nothing but the best things to say about it. Graphics, gameplay, overworks, dungeons, story arch‚Äôs, skill trees, meta development - this game has it all. You can access nearly every part of the map, horizontal and vertical scaling of all environments, and the magic system is great. 10/10 would recommend. If you like JRPGs definitely check this one out",5
"this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever gotten on my iPad, its very pretty, runs well, and has a lot of fun characters you can meet and get! my one problem with it though is how much storage it takes up, i had to offload almost all my apps and even delete some just just to update it, though i understand that its something you cant control that much.

if you‚Äôre reading this and thinking about getting the game, just make sure your device has around 10 gb available to be able to download the full game :D",5
"I pre-ordered this since it looked good, but I thought it was gonna be a letdown, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting much. I was so wrong! It is the best open world game for mobile and runs well. I love that the graphics don‚Äôt get worse on mobile, it still looks great on there! Sometimes there‚Äôs some server issues but besides that it‚Äôs really great! The only other thing I would improve is maybe taking down the price for primogem wishes, I‚Äôve made 67 wishes on a banner and still not gotten a character, only 4 star weapons. Besides that I really recommend it!",5
"It‚Äôs beautiful and very addicting and lots of stuff to do but I‚Äôm get sick and tired of the lag and the game keeping on crashing. I started to tolerate it at first, but then I started to get really annoyed when it kept on crashing, but I can tolerate the lag though. Other than that I really love the game. I can‚Äôt wait till the updates come, and keep up the hard work! All I want is for, mainly, the crashing to go away and somewhat the lag to. Hope ur having a great day üòä",5
"I am addicted to Genshin Impact. It‚Äôs so odd that a game this gorgeous can be free to play but like we should all appreciate it! Re rolling for characters is also amazing, anybody can get so excited over a character they want. I got my first S tier character and I jumped out of my seat. If you‚Äôre new to Genshin, give it a go. I hope you find this game fun. I do enjoy the story, the side quests, exploration, rewards, leveling system, etc. PLUS the game is fun with friends! Level up and defeat bosses together. If you don‚Äôt want to play it on mobile, get it on Pc or Ps4. Give it a go! :)",5
"I am in love with this game. I loved playing breath of the wild so much. This game is pretty much the same game with a different story and a different world, but! You get to collect anime waifus and work with an interchangeable team with different strengths. Warning! It is very addictive. The only problem that I have is that the game will randomly exit and I‚Äôll have to restart the app and do some things over, but it‚Äôs usually just the last thing I did before the app froze. This is one of the best app games I‚Äôve ever played. üñ§üòç",5
"This game is great i love it, let me say I‚Äôm impressed cause the map is sooo bigg and many things to doo, the UI everything is perfect even the characters and environments but there‚Äôs one problem and that is performance. Almost everytime it crashes on my phone i use an iPhone 8 pls fix that and secondly i always put it on the lowest setting and 60 fps but it doesn‚Äôt play on 60 it plays on like 45 and goes downward apart from that the game is awesome now i can play 30 with no lag I‚Äôm okay with that for now",5
This game is just so visually pleasing the best looking mobile game ever. The story is very interesting and keeps you wanting to know more about the world. When I first downloaded the game out of curiosity I was blown away by the visuals and story god I can‚Äôt get enough of the visuals. The grind is very real in this game but it‚Äôs expected of a free game like this(doesn‚Äôt really bother me). for a game this good looking I would expect it to have a price tag but no. I can go on about the visuals but I must stop. Btw Xiangling best character ever if you roll her upgrade her and enhance her weapons trust me.,5
"For nothing. I use an iPad 2017 and I have the same complaint as everyone else. The loading screen took so long to load and froze for awhile, audio was cutting in and out. When I finally got to play ( an eternity later) , there was a black mass all around, there was only a few feet around my toon that was visible. The grass and rocks next to me looked good lol I could hear water but not see it.  The audio worked fine during gameplay. When the game went to cut scenes, there was severe lag, so I couldn‚Äôt see what was going on. 

I was able to change settings to the lowest but it didn‚Äôt help at all. I‚Äôm deleting it and will check back in a few weeks to see if this issue is fixed.",2
"I love the direction iPhone/Cellular gaming is going. Developers are realizing that not everyone has access to systems or can replace their broken ones at the moment in my case. Enter Genshin Impact. Between this and OceanHorn 2 I can‚Äôt believe how the difference between console games and iPhone games has become almost indistinguishable. This game has between graphics, amazing combat, and an awesome array of characters. And I haven‚Äôt even played more than an hour consistently. I‚Äôm gonna have to add more to this review when I at least get mid game but right now all I can say is WOW.",5
"This game seems amazing it runs smoothly and the mechanics are amazing, however there is a major bug that I and many others players on ios are experiencing. Which is where you can‚Äôt see anything around besides what is in your immediate area of about 20 meters everything else is covered in black, water is also black and if you get in the water and get wet you will start flashing bright white. I personally have gotten so far in the game now that everything is black I can‚Äôt see anything but the controls. I really hope the the developers fix this problem soon so we can all enjoy the game with everyone else.",3
I‚Äôd say the game is very good visuals are fantastic and gameplay is smooth and complex yet simple. But I literally need a wet towel to play this because my phone turns into a nuclear fusion devise when playing this like turn the render distance way down or add a semi open world option because even if I want to play this I can‚Äôt because I crash every 5-7 minutes. These wouldn‚Äôt really be a problem if it wasn‚Äôt marketed toward mobile users. The performance is the only thing that is bad about this game in my opinion.,4
"The game is alright, but for a game that focused on character gameplay, they released a very very scuffed premium character that they had no intention of fixing. Her c2 should have been what her c0 was and the multipliers are super low. They basically tossed them in the rubbish bin. I think my main driving factor of this game is playing characters I enjoy as characters, but when they scuff a kit so hard it's unviable it's quite sad. I may not play much of this until they release another 5-star character visually similar the one they just did (VERY unlikely to happen soon) or until they fix the problems.

Also dailies are boring I don't do them add more fun things like the hide and seek mode and better co-op thanks.",1
Listen this game is amazing but they make us spend to much money and too much time but I like the game but it‚Äôs really hard to get the charecter you want now there‚Äôs this bug where when you download the game and no matter how much u delete it says not enough storage I deleted everything on my phone and it still said that there was still a lot of storage I even had my sister help me and she said it‚Äôs probably a bug with the game so I hope they fix that,5
"This game is outstanding! I never thought I would even like the game when I first heard about it, but then my friends at school would be playing it on their phones and iPads, and it looked so much fun! I eventually got an iPad for my grandmother, and she gave me her previous one in return, so I immediately downloaded Genshin impact and I‚Äôve been playing it nonstop. The graphics are beautiful, and the story is great! I also love the action aspect of the game. It‚Äôs truly worthy of 5 stars. Highly recommended!",5
"Gension is a amazing game with amazing art, music, and story. I really like that none of the content cost money, but the things u buy just speeds the work up. (I never spent a single penny in this game) However, throughout the gameplay, there are puzzles that are confusing.  The only complaint I have about this mind blowing game is that the instruction are incredibly vague for some of the quests, and maybe more hints would make the game better. Otherwise, 5 stars.",5
I love Yoimiya but she just had like her 3rd re-run like a couple banners ago and some characters haven‚Äôt had a re-run sense like 2.3 when they first got released and I am saving for Yae Miko next banner. But other than that the game is amazing and I love the open world you can co-op with ur friends and explore the Genshin lore. But give some other characters a chance on their re-run and not show us Yoimiya as often but she is still a great character. Just saying no hate love the game ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª,5
"Such an amazing game, totally recommend it. Though it takes a lot of storage it‚Äôs worth it! Genshin is really addictive, in a good way. As in, you wanna play in your free time. I‚Äôm a small genshin editor on TikTok and taking the time to look at the clips and fan art, all of the character designs are very well made. Ever sense the new update it‚Äôs just been an amazing game. Even when you take a break, when you join back the e excitement is still the same! Totally recommend it! (Ittosgaygirlfriend on TikTok)",5
"I have been absolutely enamored with this game since around Christmas time of 2021-Until playing Genshin Impact,I honestly thought I had lost my ability to immerse myself into a game world due to worsening depression over the years and the general apathy towards even enjoyable things that came along with it.

I wanted to continue loving Genshin,but as a dark skinned person (Black in my case) I simply lack the luxury of turning a blind eye to certain things,even within the realms of fiction and fantasy.

I do not feel welcomed in the world you have created.

I deleted the game last night,but not my account-Perhaps I still hold a little hope for change? That is incredibly unlike me,but I truly didn‚Äôt want my ‚Äútravels‚Äù to come to such a heartbreaking and abrupt end.

In all honesty,I cried as I wrote this.

Sincerely,Nicolette.",5
"To shorten this, because otherwise it would be too long, they white washed real people (such as kandake, Candace, queen of kush), made characters based off of stereotypes (biggest example being dori), have lightened their only dark characters in most of their art, made some of the only dark characters in game villains, ect. And the game itself is just bad. The primo gem system is rigged and while you don‚Äôt necessarily have to buy them to get far in the game, it is highly encouraged, especially in later gameplay. I honestly used to be a big fan but the game has gotten worse over time and now they‚Äôre being out right racist. If you‚Äôre going to play, just don‚Äôt spend money supporting these people.",1
"This is an amazing game and I recommend it if your very interested in different cultures, stories, or characters! Genshin impact is a beautiful game that has me playing it everyday, there is so much to do in Genshin! The stories are honestly the best part in my opinion, they make you grow closer to the characters and make you understand the game a little bit better each time you complete a different story/quest! I hope you look in to getting genshin! And have a good day!",5
"This game is truthfully amazing and all that it‚Äôs cracked up to be, but if you don‚Äôt commit to it then it can some times feel repetitive. But all the more, I highly encourage downloading this game even with any complication in site. And if you are hesitant on getting this game I myself can ensure you that you will be thrilled to see what awaits you. So start your adventure now, with Genshin Impact!

Sincerely, random person you have never met and probably never will <3",5
"It took two weeks to load all of the data. And I have really bad internet. I haven‚Äôt even started playing the real game and I already dislike it because of how long it‚Äôs taking to load. And, to make things worse, it was at 87 percent, it took a week, and I got the new update, and I opened it and updated Genshin Impact, and when I opened Genshin Impact again, it was back at two percent and I am very disappointed. The game preview was very good though, insane character development and graphics, and the animations are very smooth, the game is ok so far, but the actual experience is great.",3
I tried to download it but it won‚Äôt work I have to delete multiple apps because of it and when I finally got it it keeps saying ERROR there‚Äôs no more storage I just wanted and it‚Äôs just taking my storage I do not wanna waste money on storage unfair do I have to delete all of my apps just for that? Please fix it I‚Äôm begging you I‚Äôm literally on my knees make the data lower I do not want to with it I just wanna play I already have sky children of the light which have some similarities with you I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm just gonna give it three or two stars over data and storage Sincerely ME,3
Sure early on there‚Äôs plenty of emphasis on fighting and getting stronger but once you get about as strong as you will get the game just turns into a puzzle game. Most of the fighting mechanics are useless when new events come because the devs seem to have wanted to make a puzzle game instead. The fact that the prices are so outrageous to get gacha drops (characters ANDweapons) it‚Äôs just a stupid waste of money to run around with a strong character to do puzzles you have to look up on the internet by guys who don‚Äôt want to show how to complete they just show off their characters. Bad game bad community bad practices. The fun stops once you‚Äôve realized you wasted cash to be a strong fighter in a puzzle game.,1
"okokok game=decent, its not like i can do any better BUT, The char designs‚Ä¶ why.. WHY ARE THERE ONLY 2 DARKSKINS???(keaya & xinyan) The new chars have are outfit stereotypes.. Disappointing I bet I could do better.. I HAVEN‚ÄôT EVEN MADE A GAME EVER IN MY LIFE!!!!! C‚Äômon I know you can do better‚Ä¶ AND OH NO PLEASE NOT THE STORAGE IT TAKES UP LIKE 17-25GB OF MY SPACE, WHAT THE HECK!!?? AND THE NEXT UPDATE IS GONNA MAKE THE GAME TAKE UP 20-50GB OF MY SPACE, THAT IS NOT WORTH IT Also the fact that some of the women (+ children) outfits are a i bit inappropriate‚Ä¶.No, just NO NO NO NO, Get some people who actually know how to make outfits actually appropriate and actually knows how to make darkskins.. PLEASE..üòê

Honestly also, the game is getting boring the events are getting a bit more bad, taking a lot of work and time consuming. So I‚Äôm debating on quitting or not, I‚Äôll give you, Hoyoverse, ONE more chance, and if the next update is boring, time consuming, and hard work to finish, THAT is where I draw the line, and quitüôÇ

You are on THIN ice, so be careful 

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for reading this.",2
"I personally love this game because of how gripping the story is at times. This game is great if you like fighting monsters and story! For the first.. 40 or so adventure ranks. After you complete most of it, you have nothing else to do and become bored. You can do commissions and co op, as well. Even though some people are rude, the rest (or the majority) are so sweet and I even met my s/o here. It‚Äôs so beautiful and even though farming primos is taxing‚Äî it‚Äôs so fun and recommend it if you want a fun game to play casually. <3

Also~ 

hot guys and girls",5
"It‚Äôs really an amazing game, and I loved playing it so much! 
The soundtrack, the maps, the enemies, the characters, just an all around yes from me for the most part.

I personally found the storyline just a little bit difficult to follow, that‚Äôs just a personal take.. and after a little while I kind of lost interest in it? It became lots of.. event - quest - event - quest and just in general didn‚Äôt feel terribly rewarding to me.
But, the game itself is amazing and I think Hoyoverse is doing a really great job with it! I do kind of wish there were more weapons in the game, and I don‚Äôt mean add more swords/bows/polearms‚Äî I mean add more weapons like the ones in Honkai! Gauntlets, scythes, guns? They‚Äôd add a really really amazing touch in my opinion.

All in all though, Genshin Impact is an amazing game and I think Hoyoverse(MIHOYO) is doing an incredible job on it.
 Keep up the good work! :)",5
It‚Äôs a really good game but the only thing I think would put it down is the Gacha system even though you really don‚Äôt need to do the Gacha. It‚Äôs a very pretty game with beautiful graphics and characters. It‚Äôs combat is also super fun. I do recommend giving it a try even if you don‚Äôt like Gacha games. It‚Äôs world is also very nice. If you think it‚Äôs limited that is because the game is nowhere near finished. I feel that the game is very fun and the graphics are great I definitely recommend this game.,5
"The game is definitely a gacha game.  Everything is based around spending energy.  But you don‚Äôt have to spend money, there‚Äôs enough free characters you can get high constellations on.   I like the game, I still play it.   

That said, their website bugs out constantly, I cannot access it on an iPhone using safari, chrome, or Firefox.  On the pc I can only access it on Firefox, and it still times out.

Their launcher for pc is broke.  It forces most pc users to manually install, and it‚Äôs been broke for years too.  So if you thought you would have a fun multi platform game, think again.  

The news updates in the mobile app never load (and I mean never, they‚Äôve only ever loaded from the pc client).  The links to events or surveys in the mail used to work a year ago but no longer work (probably due to the website which has not functioned properly for months).

Fun game, could be loads better.   Don‚Äôt play it if you don‚Äôt like gacha games.  It‚Äôs not a jrpg.  Its an energy based p2w.",2
"Overall, Genshin is a good game, my favorite game in my phone even! But, there is a small problem that I‚Äôd like to address. You spend more time waiting for downloads of data (that take like 3 hours to finish maybe even more) other than ACTUALLY playing the game- it‚Äôs absurd. Through all the days and weeks I‚Äôve put into this game- I‚Äôve had to sit through 4 downloads already for the data!! Why make a game if you can‚Äôt even play it half the time because your waiting for a download?!? I understand if it‚Äôs something you can‚Äôt control, and you have to do it, but come on!",3
"I seriously love this game so much the art and graphics are a whole other breed. Two things I would probably fix or add is 1. When you do a world quest involving a mechanism, I believe it should reset after a certain number of Adventures Ranks have passed but to make it harder, you change up the mechanism. The higher ranked people in this game literally never find chests in their world so I think it would be fair to let them get more primos. And 2. To make this games adds better because I see the, and they are awful üòü",4
"ppl are gonna be like ‚Äòhow is genshin impact ur comfort game, its literally so stressful‚Äô like its only stressful if you make it like that. if you emerge urself into artifact grinding, primogems, etc. ur bound to have a stressful game experience. you have to make the game experience lighter for urself, if you got a bad artifact after all your farming, if you couldnt find any chest, you didnt get the character you wanted, etc. take a break! enjoy the scenery, relax in the music, even listen to your favorite characters voicelines! theres many things to do in genshin impact thats not stressful. theres many reasons why i love this game and why i wont abandon it. im a very enthusiastic person when it comes to genshin impact and hopefully, that wont change. thank you, hoyoverse. for such an amazing game. i thank you. btw tell mihoyo i miss them! (jkjk i know ur still the same ppl)",5
Omggg don‚Äôt get me started on genshin impact it‚Äôs so fun to play especially the co op mode but there‚Äôs a slight thing about the quest trails in tianqiu I can‚Äôt seem to play co op anymore because of this quest‚Ä¶ I see that a lot of people have been having this problem and I hope it can be resolved like if you could turn co op back on for this quest I hope you can help everyone out here but overall the game is amazing ü§©. I will still continue playing but could you fix this problem? Thanks!,5
"This game is ridiculously good. I'm so blown away. Open world RPG. Yes it has gatcha mechanics, but guess what you don't have to spend money to enjoy it and get characters. I'm having a total BLAST! With the constant updates and patches- the content just doesn't end.  and since it is Ported to PS4 & PC! I play it on my computer and then it's nice that I can also play on the go on my iPad or iPhone. 

My only gripe- I wish It was a bit better in the ""play with friends"" aspect... But regardless - still a great solo game!",5
"All of my friends were begging me to get this game, so obviously I had to get it. In the beginning it was starting to make me bored so I didn‚Äôt play for a while but then when I started to play again, I played and got to a higher adventure level and leveled up my characters. The best part that I love about this game are all the characters that I‚Äôve obtained so far! This game is also very fun with all its quests and levels! That‚Äôs why this is a 100% 5 star rating :)",5
"I absolutely love Genshin Impact the graphics, characters, and lore are all amazing. I would write so much more on it too. The only issue I have with the game is the fact that it's GB size is so large, I've personally deleted many apps for genshin in the past however each update takes 4 GB which seems to be way too much for my phone. Currently it's 60/64GB, I most likely won't be able to play more with the next update along with other players. It's an incredible game though!",5
"Okay so the currency is a HUGE problem in this game, mora and primo gems‚Äô value are severely different, not because of the Gacha aspect, also bcs they‚Äôre used to pay for speeding up certain events or items. An event banner is up for at most a week or two. How long does it take to farm up enough for a 10 roll? Nearly two weeksüò∏ this is outrageous and it encourages spending a LOT. Unless you feel like hoarding and waiting for your character to come back next two months, then you‚Äôve gotta spend at least some money. Big no no especially when certain events are pay to win. Save yourself the trouble of grinding this stupid game, and save your wallet as well. Not worth at all playing",1
"It start from a Great game to one of the Worst game not because of the gameplay and graphics it WAS fun but not anymore. The company decides to make the game even harder by their stupid RNG/ Drop rates, high pity in wishes and high worth of primogems/gems per dollar. And the most disappointing and frustrated one is their anniversary rewards worst rewards ever considering that they we‚Äôre probably one of the most wealthy game company so tight to give a better anniversary rewards which is frustrating. This was used to be a recommended game to my friends but now it‚Äôs not anymore. I hope next time they improve their way of thinking and think about their players, look how low/ down they are now.",1
This game does not lack in content whatsoever. Characters all feel relatively unique for the most part and the combat system is stellar. Prepare to feel really bummed out when grinding if you set your heart on getting a specific character or relic with certain stats. The developers seem to know what they are doing in terms of designing the game and ‚Äúbalancing‚Äù to a certain extent. This games biggest shortcoming is most definitely the tone deafness of the developers when it comes to their own communities feedback. It‚Äôs fun and a enjoyable way to kill some time but definitely not worth devoting whole days to.,3
"I love genshin impact. I've played since 1.5 to 2.1 and it was amazing to see all the content, however when you reach endgame, the game has no content and becomes extremely boring and feels like you're not playing the game but a chore, and since mihoyo released the Genshin rewards which are incredibly underwhelming, I and other plays are burned out. More issues are the lack of communication between Mihoyo and the Community. How much drama sparked and mihoyo is just sitting there and watching the fire burn doing nothing which leads to many old players quitting. Genshin impact has incredible potential, although its lack of communication and content make this game wasted.",2
"Listen the Genshin community if one of the most ungrateful communities I‚Äôve ever been in. They still work hard every day and people are still complaining about the rewards, if they gave a lot of primo gems wouldn‚Äôt that make the game super easy? At least they still have us rewards for their anniversary and even made a special event tracking and letting us know about our progress. They seem too busy focusing on the game play, story quests, and characters. Anyways Happy Birthday Genshin.",5
"I love this game, in fact overall the game is really fun. The story is well done, but the reason i‚Äôd give a 2 star is because they don‚Äôt care about any of their supporters or players at all. I‚Äôve spent about 50$ on this game and they can‚Äôt even care to give back to us? Some people have spent thousands with nothing back. The company wouldn‚Äôt be here if it wasn‚Äôt for its payers, the game would have flopped. Even though the game is nice, it‚Äôs almost not worth it if the company doesn‚Äôt even care about us. They don‚Äôt listen to our complaints or anything. Nothing has changed for a year now, and at this point don‚Äôt expect anything else to change.",2
"miHoYo really needs to communicate more with the player base. There is so little communication from then that players often rely on less credible sources for upcoming events and info. 

The anniversary were also disappointing to say the least. I understand they‚Äôre a company that needs to make money but gacha games are generally very generous during anniversaries and other special events. Clearly not this game right now. 

I really do enjoy the story, the graphics, the details, almost everything about this game. But the company needs NEEDS to listen to the playerbase and communicate",3
"I‚Äôm definitely not a typical ‚Äúgamer‚Äù but I absolutely love this game. I had seen it floating around on social media and what finally made me download it was that one of my friends encouraging me so we could play together.
Needless to say I was quickly entranced by the art and world building, and spent the next two weeks catching up to my friend who had been playing for months.
I have no regrets and would recommend this game to anyone, whether they play games or not!",5
"This game is so amazing! It‚Äôs a game I‚Äôve actually continued to play and not just stopped playing because I‚Äôm bored or it‚Äôs too difficult. Genshin also has a plot and great voice actors! It‚Äôs something to be grateful for due to the fact that you aren‚Äôt promised this in every game. Not only that the graphics and design of genshin are amazing! fight scenes and dialogue are carefully planned out and executed correctly. If you‚Äôre questioning yourself and asking, ‚ÄúShould I get this game?‚Äù The answer is clear to see. Yes. Yes you should.",5
"So I love this game. I play daily, and I have been since November 2020. The only problem that I have with it is that it takes so much storage. I know it kind of sounds impossible to change something like that, but a lot of people have had to delete this game because it takes way too much storage and their device can‚Äôt handle it. It‚Äôs really hard especially that every update adds more storage. Could it be possible for you to change this?",5
"Honestly i only got it because my boyfriend plays it and seems to love it. I ended up falling for the game though! As someone who could never really play BOTW, this game was amazing! It gives you the nudge of where you need to go, but doesn't force it. It also doesn't leave you to figure everything out on your own. It lets you do everything in your own time and i love that! Also the character designs are AMAZING!!! Venti, Diona and Razor are my personal favorites! Keep making this game great Mihoyo!",5
"Currently on the Inazuma quest and I‚Äôm stuck on the part of escorting the cargo. Not because I can‚Äôt kill the enemies or anything but the enemies don‚Äôt even load in. When they do load in there‚Äôs like only 10 seconds left, and that only is for the first section, meaning that the first section itself take 4 minutes just to load, and it doesn‚Äôt help that you have to go through the dialogue again each time you fail it. I‚Äôve already restarted my device multiple time, deleted and re-downloaded the game multiple times and I‚Äôm still not able to pass it.",3
"One of the most beautiful games I‚Äôve ever played. Genshin is fun to play, like Fate/GO I have been hooked since I started playing. However my main problem is the crashing. After a while the game will just randomly crash. The worst time when the game crashes is when you are doing the good hunter delivery quest, because if your game crashes when you are doing this quest suddenly it does not count and you have to start again. Otherwise I love this game and will keep playing. Paimon is super cute.",4
"I love the game! From the graphics to the storyline, I love it. I just really wish you could cancel or abandon World quests. I talk to random NPCs and they force me to do a quest I don't want to do. So I wish you could cancel it. I have like 50 world quests that I haven't done, and don't want to do. And their sitting there. Just a pile of quests. So I wish you could cancel them. And if you want to do the quest after all, you could talk to the NPC again. When you cancel it, it wouldn't be visible on the map, or world quest page. I hope this is added soon.",4
"Yo Techmology, is it good or is it whack?
Well this game is good, really good actually. 
Visually stunning with great anime style characters. Very free to play friendly and lots of fun. Imagine Breath of the Wild and sword art hollow realization and you get something like this. Much better than Honkai impact in my opinion. Playing on PS4 is great since it still doesn‚Äôt have controller support on iOS. It would be great if devs gave us controller support and the ability to share save files between ps4 and iOS.  Other than that, I‚Äôm looking forward to version 1.1. Great job so far miHoYo!",4
"Genshin is one of those rare games that perfectly integrates everything I love in a game: intense lore and story driven combat, meaningful quests, beautiful character and world design, and unlockable characters/weapons. I understand that many people are upset about not being able to advance without hitting a paywall, but my rational is that I would EASILY pay at least $50 for this on a console and more for any extra DLC. This has become my absolute favorite game, I am so excited for this new update!",5
"Hi! I‚Äôm 11 and I have an issue with this app, it asks to track me when I use other apps, when I click don‚Äôt allow it doesn‚Äôt even let me in the app itself it happened again when I downloaded it again for the 2nd time. This is hard for me sense I wanna try out the app but it won‚Äôt even let me in even if I don‚Äôt want it tracking me down on other apps. Please tell me if there‚Äôs something wrong with the app or if there‚Äôs something wrong with me. 

Thank you, sincerely Lisa",5
"Prologue is a bit lengthy and you can get side tracked pretty quickly harvesting materials for cooking / upgrades / etc. wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if some things aren‚Äôt locked until you finish the prologue. Once that is finished you are unable to proceed with story until you reach adventure lvl 15. By the time I finished the prologue I was at 8. The other thing is the lvl grind is horrible. Unless you get the lvl up books your characters will take an eternity trying to lvl up. Doesn‚Äôt matter lvl of enemies either I‚Äôve battled lvl 4, 10, & 12 creatures that only dropped 10xp? You need several thousand and I be been unable to lvl up through ‚Äútraditional‚Äù grinding",3
"This is the best game I have played since Skyrim. World is massive, and it‚Äôs not even close to being finished. Combat is amazing. Characters are are really cool, and all viable. Team building, character building is all really good. I oppose the Resin system but I understand why it‚Äôs there. That‚Äôs literally my only complaint. However, there‚Äôs still plenty to do without resin so it‚Äôs not that big of a deal really. Can‚Äôt wait to see where this game goes, and I‚Äôm not looking forward to it ending. This was the best thing to happen in 2020. Thank you MiHoYo.",5
"This is one the best rpgs to play on mobile, hands down. I have cleared most of the story mode and about to hit ar40.

This only negative thing I have to say is the lack of things to do once you have finished most of the story mode, and the lack of materials/mora to progress other characters. Currently I just logon to do the dailies, burn through my resin and left with nothing else to do. 

Besides that, the actual gameplay is amazing. The combat system, the ability to fly freely and discover secrets here and there. And if your into storylines, this game has it.",5
"Genshin Impact is a lot of fun, I have been playing it non stop recently. The only thing I would say it lacks is the ability to customize at least your main character. Most people like to play as characters that look like themselves, including myself. However, there are no redheaded female characters, only men. I understand that red hair isn‚Äôt necessarily a common trait, but It still be really cool to play as one. Hopefully either a customizing feature will be released in the future or a redhead female character will be created!",5
"This game is amazing! I absolutely love the graphics, and I really like how hard they worked on it, and it‚Äôs free! It‚Äôs an amazing anime adventure and I really like it. It is so underrated and should be blowing up right now. I play this game on a pretty old phone and it‚Äôs super good, but for the best experience on old devices you should play it while charging it. And headphones of course make this adventure so real. It‚Äôs co op too! It‚Äôs just a great game and you should play it. It has my five stars! üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå",5
"Good content and characters but the controls on mobile are clunky. In battle it‚Äôs much worse. The camera will often focus on empty land while enemies are attacking you. The flight controls are extremely sluggish so when you depend on them for battle, you‚Äôre out of luck. Automatically starting to climb on objects is a problem because the camera is so unstable so mid battle you‚Äôll start climbing and often get attacked. Recovery from getting knocked down needs work too. It‚Äôs often a long process leaving you open to follow up attacks. Reaction time is the main issue with the mobile version of the game.",3
"Most beautiful game on phone and best game I could ever ask for but there is one problem.... they are good at making the game looks amazing, smooth, breathtaking, and addictive but they are not good at making events. But I am sure that will change in the future I am looking forward to better events and better ways to progress through the game more and not wait a long time for resin to recharge. I enjoy exploring the whole map cant wait for the next areas to be unlocked and I am really looking forward to seeing this game grow.",5
"this game is the only mobile game I‚Äôve actually put real hours into. About 60+ hours right now. but this is happening more frequently and it makes it really hard to keep wanting to play. Its not like I‚Äôm running far out of range, I mostly use a a close range character. the monsters just start walking away and then suddenly all their health is back. It‚Äôs very disheartening. otherwise, timed challenges are unreasonably short sometimes. all the missions I am stuck on are because of the just too short time limit. I adore the characters though. and I hope that this issue is fixed soon.",3
"Look, I don‚Äôt have the heart to rate this masterpiece anything lower than 5. But... There are things that need fixing! 
1. Long white that lasts 1/2 minutes before you see the game menu
2. The occasional lag when settings are higher than lowest, like medium.
3. THE CRASHING! It will randomly crash multiple times! Thankfully it‚Äôs not consecutive but you won‚Äôt last 2 hours without having at least 1 game crash! Sometimes the game crashes as soon as you open it too!
If I have anything else to say I‚Äôll edit it in.",5
"When I first saw this game I was so hyped. It looks amazing. The graphics, the characters, everything just looks so polished and well done. So of course I installed it. But when I opened the app, all i saw was a white screen. I thought it was just a minor bug so I sat there and waited for the game to load in. Well it didn‚Äôt load so I reinstalled it and tried again. The same thing happened, a white screen right when I open the game. I was so excited to play this game but sadly I can‚Äôt even get pass the loading screen.

I searched online and it seems that lots of other people are having the same problem. Hopefully the developers can fix this bug so I can play this great looking game. For now, I will rate it as a 1 star because it is unplayable.",1
"This game has far exceeded my expectations. Coming from the semi open maps on Honaki Impact to the fully immersive map in Genshin Impact is outstanding. I never thought that I would find a game that gives me the same feeling of a console on mobile so soon. There is the possibility of flaws ahead but I am positive the developers will take care of things from a product perspective. Note: I have not played Breath of Wild so I can‚Äôt speak to that. However, if you are looking for a true open-world RPG on mobile, this is it!",5
"Let me start off with something: I love this game. It‚Äôs amazing, and I love the characters and combat system. But It crashes SO much. No matter how much space I have open on my iPad, it‚Äôll just crash. I could be walking around or not doing anything when for no reason it just kicks me out. It makes the game practically unplayable. If it gets updated to not crash anymore, I swear I will never put it down again. I have it down as four stars, since I can barely play the game, no matter how much it deserve the full five. Please fix this crashing issue. It would be amazing.",4
"This game is definitely a 5/5, the story is great, the characters are great, the art style is great and really everything is great, I‚Äôm not gonna go too deep into anything but the only negative thing in this game at all is sometimes I get frame rate drops and the loading time is a bit slow (I am only on an iPhone 7 though) a lot of people have been comparing in to breath of the wild and it is very similar but it‚Äôs it‚Äôs still so different and I love it

Again, 5/5 stars and definitely my favorite game this year",5
"Future gacha/rpg games need to step up their game, or don‚Äôt even bother releasing their crap. It has been since the start of mobile gaming that we have had to play with mediocre gacha/rpg games. Now finally a high quality game that is worthy to be in the league of handhelds, PC, and main stream consoles. I truly hope Mihoyo succeed with game and become the SquareEnix of the mobile gaming. Even SE mobile games cannot compare to Genshin Impact. 

Suggestion to Mihoyo: keep it PvE and do not let it become PvP, that is a toxic world I don‚Äôt want to be part of.",5
Okay if you having a hard time play the game trust me you can make your time the characters are really good and the designs are great and you can play the characters you want and if you having problems don‚Äôt worry you have a character that you can relate to and you make a comfort team for your troubles to and there are events going on every few weeks i think and you can collect characters limited standards if you and c6 them,5
"So I got this on pre-order and as soon as it finished downloading I opened the app... Unfortunately to my surprise all that showed up was a blank white screen and then the game closed out of itself. I had looked up to see if this was a common issue and it‚Äôs not which is good news but not for me. After much deliberation and searching I decided to delete and re install it but surprisingly I have the same problem. I love all the videos I have seen of the game so by no means is this a criticism. Although that does not mean bugs and errors like these should go unnoticed but to be fair I am still using an iPhone 7 Plus in which I do not think that is where the problem lies. Thank You for The Beautiful Game Which I Will Get to Enjoy atSome-point.

Kind Regards, Noah",1
"to start, i‚Äôve played genshin since day one of release. up until the past 4-5 months, i‚Äôd purchased every single battle pass and almost always purchased currency in order to obtain characters on limited banners. the reason behind this was because the likelihood of getting currency and ‚Äúwishes‚Äù (a token purchased with currency to use the gacha) was VERY limited and largely rng. the issue with the fans being child predators grows more and more prevalent daily, spanning beyond the child characters (unfortunately labeled ‚Äúloli‚Äù in the game files). if you are unfortunate enough as to download this game, good luck.
update: if you play this, what is wrong with you. entire new region is pro-colonization racist stuff. L.",1
"The game itself is very good, the quest, the voices and the characters. It may just be me but some quests are really difficult, I‚Äôve had this game for a year, and I still haven‚Äôt made it past the ascension quest 1, I have leveled all my main characters up to around 50. But the fighting gets worse, and it kills my characters, all of them, I‚Äôve used all my food and enhanced my weapons, and I still can‚Äôt get past it. That seems to be my only problem, but other than that it is a beautiful game",4
"This game is really amazing. Ticks all the boxes great graphics, cool animation, a wishing system, entertainment, and lore. There is just one problem: The quest to unlock the chasm. It‚Äôs hard to complete and with out completing you can‚Äôt unlock the Casey and not being able to do that means you can‚Äôt progress in the game. It‚Äôs long, annoying and annoying but fun. I‚Äôm not motivated to do it, I am mentally disabled and it is hard for me. I just with there was away around this. Hoyoverse please fix this problem please. The quest is the reason a few of my friends quit Genshin.",4
"Basically a really good game, anyone could complain about the gatcha system. Nice gameplay. You do need pretty good connection for this, but it‚Äôs still very good. Maybe the game devs could be responsive to complaints and have a better filling system for complaints. I don‚Äôt understand why this has so many bad reviews, but many are just people hating on a game they played for 3 minutes and decided that they hate it so much to give it a half star review and leave hate reviews.",5
"I find this as a reoccurring problem to me and other fans when a new Genshin impact update comes out for mobile devices! I really want Yae Miko, but the thing is, I can‚Äôt get the game to update anymore, no matter what I do. And it s because of my storage every time! I really hope this can be fixed, because I‚Äôm probably going to miss Yae Miko‚Äôs banner thanks to it. I had saved 4000 primogems just for her banner, and now I can‚Äôt use them. I hope this can be fixed in future updates, this is a very good game, and I hope it becomes more popular, but this NEEDS, to be fixed!",3
"There are many pros and cons to this game, but I would like to start with the pros. 
 fun playstyle - theres a very big variety of playstyles of your liking, which is great
 
so much to explore - at the start of the game, theres so much to do and you cant get a break 

fun events - personally, many events for the game are actually very fun and you can get many rewards, such as primogems, free 4* characters, etc 

theres many more, but i wish to make this as short as possible, now i will begin with the cons
 
terrible representation - starting off with the obvious, many characters are pale lightskin, theres nothing wrong with that, but for a region based off south asia, there should be more dark skinned characters, not just 2-3. 

racist and terrible character designs - another obvious, for example Yae Miko's design is very disrespectful and is meant to be a SHRINE MAIDEN 
pain to gain good characters - farming constantly? not exactly the best sadly, plus the rewards are so low its painful",3
"I downloaded genshin around the time of its release in 2020, but then I had stopped for about a year. I just tried to play it again earlier this year, and I didn‚Äôt think I would love this game the way I do now.

I love the character designs, and the lore of the game! It‚Äôs just an overall fun experience! Hopefully there is a way to go back to past events, I had no idea how many events I missed just because I was on a hiatus, I would love to experience them sometime.",5
I LOVE this game! I highly recommend anyone and everyone to play it. It‚Äôs fun and has a good plot with tons of things to explore. The only thing is I get locked into quest I cannot do. I have 4 quest that I need to do before I can move on and my characters cannot do them. I have an idea that may work. The game should allow the player to cancel a quest but by doing so they have to completely start over and lose anything they gained while in the quest. So I hope the creators see this and take my idea because it really is a great game!,4
"The game is really good and fun to explore, worth the storage but the problem with mobile/iPad players is the storage, I believe hoyoverse will lose a majority of their population since millions play on ipad and mobile. I had to delete every app on my iPad to download the update. It‚Äôs really upsetting how we are not acknowledged for our storage problems, overall the game is worth the money In my opinion, I‚Äôve spent over 30 dollars and did not disappoint. Great game, I just wish there would be more events of old ones like the seelie event or windtrace",4
"I love this game so much! The quality is just amazing! And I love the fact that you can teleport so you don‚Äôt have to walk all the way to your destinations! The character that truly inspired me is hu Tao! I would recommend getting her,I don‚Äôt have her YET! But other then that you should definitely download this game! Some of the characters voice lines comfort me with my anxiety and some are really funny! Don‚Äôt get me started on the food the food looks amazing! It makes me hungry! Download this game!!",5
"I‚Äôm horribly upset at the lack of diversity in this game. Yet the game prides itself on having all these different cultures, yet every character is PALER THAN MOST WHITE PEOPLE. It makes no sense. The ‚Äòdark skinned‚Äô characters we have and will have, are just tanned in comparison to several people (white tanned people), they are the same skin shade as some charters. Let‚Äôs not forget how Hoyoverse WHITEWASHES every SINGLE poc character that they have in every single event they do. This isn‚Äôt something to just look over because the characters are pretty. Hoyoverse has heard the community cry for more poc, yet, nothing changes. They admit to doing nothing wrong and then drip-leak new characters to make you forget about the true issues at hand.",1
"I have a friend whose account got hacked and ended up with a negative balance of primogems. Even though they showed customer support bank statements to prove that the transaction was fraudulent, and they showed proof from their account that no primogems were spent, customer support has refused to help them in any way and is instead banning their account for holding a negative balance. They care more about currency that was never spent than the experience of a customer who would gladly continue playing long term. I personally will no longer be spending money on primogems, seeing as how the account can be completely lost and the company will do nothing to help.",1
Play next to the back has hold me through the hard Times and I really enjoy playing lea it is so fun you had different characters like clean my favorite especially caused her and yeahShow me people to play this game it makes me feel warm because we can use it so it‚Äôs got me to boredom and everything it‚Äôs a very good girl I love all the characters and I haven‚Äôt even wished yet but I can‚Äôt wait,5
"So, I started to play Genshin a few months ago, and I LOVE the game. The characters are amazing, and the music is sooo beautiful and calming.
 But a few days ago my co-op mode was not working anymore. It said that it can‚Äôt load anymore worlds, and to look some where else.I try to sign in and out, but it didn‚Äôt work. So I looked up on how to get it working again, and one was to check if your doing a story quest. I checked, and I‚Äôm not doing one. I don‚Äôt know what else to do so please help me!",5
"This game is so fun and totally addicting but it comes with downfalls. First, the Gacha you usually need lots of pity to get the character you want also most times you lose you 50/50s and that can be a really bad thing because a lot of players are f2p so they don‚Äôt have enough fates nor primos I personally think that they need to have a way for f2p players to get primos easier. Second, the nerfed characters Albedo and dilucs hair totally got nerfed- Dilucs hair was supposed to be fluffy but instead we got a 26 year old depressed long haired idiot also his outfit is horrid! But overall pretty good game.",3
"I honestly love this game- the Graphics, the voice acting, the story‚Äôs, everything is perfect but one thing that really bugs me is the fact that there is no cross-saving between servers. Me and my friend were trying to get to the multiplayer level to play together until we found out we are in different servers. I tried going to the other server but I had to create a new save for that server. I honestly think if you add this feature to the game it‚Äôll help a lot of people out for those with a similar problem.",4
"I have had this game for a long time on my phone, and then got it on my pc. There is so much to do in this game and so many great characters to play as. I do say i get mad when I pull but the lose the 50/50 - This game has its ups and downs but it is by far the best game I have played. There are good graphics, Great voice overs, and so much more. It can be hard sometimes but i understand that I have to build my characters up to do certain things. But I definitely recommend this game.",5
"I really like this game, I‚Äôve been playing it for a very long time! But when the 2.5 update came I had to log back in, I tried to login it wouldn‚Äôt let me. I made sure I did it right but it still wouldn‚Äôt let me in, I deleted it and downloaded it again but I still couldn‚Äôt get in. I also couldn‚Äôt make a new account. I was new so there‚Äôs no way I could have gotten hacked I was at at 8, Genshin if this is a bug or some of sort please try to fix it",5
"Just here to explain why the game takes up so much data- basically it‚Äôs a huge world, with over 100 quests (probably more like 2-3 hundred) that couldn‚Äôt be supported if it took any less space. at the end of the day, genshin is a computer game optimized for mobile. It takes about 15 gb (as of 2.4), but as there are currently 17 regions (yes, only three countries, counting by statues of the seven) the game‚Äôs huge size is almost understandable.",5
"I‚Äôve really been enjoying Genshin since I got into it a little over a year ago, however my biggest issue with the game has been the size. I‚Äôm a mobile player, and as time goes on I find myself deleting things to make room for new updates, its getting really close to the point where I won‚Äôt be able to play anymore, at least not on my phone. My biggest suggestion would be to make changes to what is and isn‚Äôt currently being used so save space or possibly move into new platforms like Xbox.",3
"Genshin is an amazing game with a wonderful fandom, they come out with the best characters and it overall stole my heart. My cousin lives in Arkansas and we can‚Äôt really see each other, but whenever we call and get in Genshin we make so many jokes and have so much fun as we beat up bosses. No matter if your bosses are ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or not, everything gets harder as you progress, and I remember having a photo shoot with my characters and my cousins‚Äô characters with different sceneries. They were so gorgeous! <3",5
"I think the game is REALLY fun and the world is amazing, I really got to surround myself woth beautiful environments. But, the end game content is not there, I recommend creating end games content like Windtrace or Labrith Warriors because there's no stress unlike Abyss. And please, please for the love of god release as much males as females. The amount of waifus in this game is insane, I understand you gotta do what the fans like but the majority of people like in-depth characters not just some thicc thighs nice girl like Ayaka or Ganyu. Some characters honestly feels like NPC but good looking for me to judge on appearance wise",4
"I cleared up basically all my games only 7 of them are on my Home Screen I deleted all my memories In Photos, It won‚Äôt let me install! This is very confusing, I have nothing left and you won‚Äôt even respond? I thought that you must respond to others if they are having trouble with the game, and you only answer when it‚Äôs been on for like 2yrs?! I want Genshin Impact to have a little less things so then everyone with little storage can also enjoy the game, also you could add different types of the game so like if some don‚Äôt have enough storage you can let them still play but with the amount of storage they have",2
"I love this game and I play it more than anything on my phone but recently it's not loading. On the element screen it stops on the last one. I've tried everything I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it's not working. I'm not sure if I'm the only one that has this problem if I'm not can you fix it please so I can actually play the game, if I'm the only can you help me fix it. Thankyou for reading this and again I love the game a lot and I'm glad to have the game.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I want more freemogems because they are a but too sparse for more casual players. I really liked the large amount of freemogems you gave out for the Playstation contest and the OST contest and wish that you did such things a bit more often. Obviously, you need to make money, but its hard to get all of the primos you need when they are this sparse. Otherwise, it is a really good game and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and anything of the Gacha genre",5
"Alright so I love the game and all. But, the abyss order thing is hard. Honestly to much with the time limits and stuff. But the thing that bothers me the most is how hard it is to get primogems!! I swear this game is a pay to get‚Ä¶ Sorry. But please hand out primogems more often or fix the wishing system. Like, I just got done doing a ten pull. It took a while to get everything and, I got a fricking four star bow!? Like!! I barley use bows. I literally only have Amber!! And I don‚Äôt even use her!? You should be giving us better rewards 2400 primogems for all that honestly is not fair to the player. Please fix this overall love the game. (I swear I have the luck of Bennett!!!!!)",2
"Genshin Impact is a super fun open world game, but I've found it gets harder and harder for me to want to keep it on my phone solely because of the file size. It's difficult because I have other things I need to have on my phone and Genshin taking up almost half of my space really isn't helping much. It would be nice if there was a possibility of reducing the games file size, as I'd really like to not have to delete the game. Again, I love it a lot, I just cant handle how much space it takes up.",4
"Ive never played a game thats open world was like this, the map is rich with wonderful places and it feels like am actually going somewhere. Not only that but the sound track is wonderful, moments when I take a stroll around the map and a peaceful song starts to play. There are frequent updates and the characters are so love able and colorful, the graphics are well done to. I hope this review could be helpful to the people questioning to buy this beautiful game.",5
"I love Genshin Impact! It is so well designed and inclusive. You can play by yourself or play with other in CO-OP. My favorite feature in this game would probably be wishing, Even though it is pretty hard to get Primogems ( Source used for wishing ) MiHoyo gives us many opportunities to earn primogems as well as giving is some in the. The community is also very nice and funny at most times. Overall I would recommend Genshin Impact to anyone who needs something to do!!

Have a save journey through Teyvat.",5
Ok I Love the game so keep it up but one small problem THE UPDATES I mean the updates are great but once the game finishes updating why do I have to wait five hours for it to finish. I mean it‚Äôs great how you make it so detailed but FIVE HOURS unexceptionable I mean three even four hours I understand but why five please make it so people don‚Äôt have to wait five hours to get back into the game. Please fix it but other than that it‚Äôs a great game and I love the graphics and detail so please make the wait time shorter just by one hour. Thank you keep doing what you do,4
"10/10 graphics? storyline? rpg? action? adorable characters that make me broke trying to buy? yeah this game has all of those. it‚Äôs pretty great, especially since it‚Äôs FREE. i don‚Äôt have really any errors at all, and it‚Äôs highly time consuming. it‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre bored! the only thing i‚Äôm mad about is the storage ‚Äî but that‚Äôs to be expected from a game like this. the character designs and gameplay are unique and give an amazing feel, they all have their own personalities. <3 love u mihoyo",5
"The game at its core is better than most AAA games on the market however the fact that after one year and having made billions of dollars, the devs gave a whole 10x pull as an anniversary reward is a joke. Other games have made far less and rewarded their players with more. The worst part is Mihoyo would have let these rewards be final but instead made items that were going to be available for purchase for $30 as fake anniversary rewards to play damage control. Items were a name card, title, wings, and 6 pulls. In short, the core game is good, but the devs are greedy even by gacha game standards, so avoid spending money until communication improves, which isn‚Äôt  likely.",1
"This game was already getting stale for me but I kept playing cause the anniversary was coming up. I whaled on the Raiden banner too but I‚Äôm done. I won‚Äôt be spending anymore money for A LONG TIME. The anniversary celebration was abysmal and forced me to start 2 other ha ha games during their anniversary just to feel appreciated. I‚Äôll be switching to Pok√©mon Masters for awhile and will probably only play Genshin occasionally until Blue Protocol comes out when I will drop it entirely. It‚Äôs really a shame MiHoYo doesn‚Äôt care about their player base, because this game was amazing when I first started but has done nothing to improve the experience and little to fix issue that plague the game like the terrible resin system.",1
"I love this game! But i wish there could be more quests to get primogems. Also i wish we could i guess on characters birthdays we could have a quest for them, cause i feel really bad when i cant find them- especially for Venti like i A C T U A L L Y felt super bad when i couldn't find him ü•≤‚ú®‚ú® oh but i LOVE all the character designs, talents, and soooo much more this is probably one of my favorite games! If this game was a character it would totally be a 5 star!!! Well baiiii keep upüÜô theüçÑgreat‚ú®worküß≥",5
"Genshin is literally my favorite game, I‚Äôm addicted to it‚Ä¶ and spending my money on it. I think I have great luck on banners, I got Ayaka on a 1 pull and same with half of my other characters, I‚Äôm way to impatient to save up for 10 pulls so I just get a wish as soon as I have 160 primogems, In love with this game and I‚Äôm excited for the new 2.1 update, we can get primos and wishes so I‚Äôm happy about that. I hope I can pull Baal or Sucrose because I‚Äôve been trying to get them. Amazing game, would recommend playing. üëç",5
"For a mobile game, I‚Äôm so surprised with the graphics and the gameplay. The only bad thing is that Gacha and how your guaranteed a character at 90 but overall the game is magnificent! The storyline is amazing and creative. Every characters kit is very talented and such and the voice actors, attacks and others have such delicate detail. And the fact you can teleport on this open map makes it much better! Please download genshin impact. It‚Äôs the BEST! But also on PC has better quality.",5
"At times the combat feels really bland and boring. After the first area the combat feels repetitive so exploring becomes the main part of the game. Exploring is really fun at times like doing the quests in dragonspine mountain. But it gets frustrating when you trying to find the last anemo
or geo crystals for that last bit of stamina takes forever. After the anemo region the world becomes a lot more fun to explore because of how diverse it feels. Besides the combat the game is fun to play so give it a try.",5
"This game is a God sent. Everything about it is incredible. My only problem with the game is that the starting characters (Kaeya, Lisa, and Amber) are never on the featured five star banners. That is why it is so difficult to receive constellations for these characters, which essentially make them more powerful. I have been playing this game for a while and still use the starting characters, so if Mihoyo could put them on a featured banner every once in a while, that would be great!",5
"This is an outstanding game. It‚Äôs really crazy that you can play this game, on your phone, for free. Pull rates for 5 stars is pretty low, but you honestly don‚Äôt need them. There‚Äôs a pity system too, so you‚Äôll eventually pull five star characters without spending. Game is super deep, crazy polished, and really fun. Everyone should play Genshin. 

It‚Äôs waaaaay better with a controller, and that is how it should be experienced imo. But you can get by just fine with touch (it‚Äôs what led me to ultimately get a backbone controller).",5
"I‚Äôve first played this at around August-September 2020, I got hooked to the graphics and lore. Although the late game character and weapon ascend/rank up can get tedious, but that is too be expected from an open world rpg. The map is HUGE, the graphics are BEAUTIFUL, the characters are GREAT. Sure, the game might drain the battery due to how detailed it is. I mean, it pretty much is a computer game with how detailed the graphics are. I‚Äôm so glad to see this game during its 1st anniversary since its launch.",5
"The game is great overall but today I tried to get the Gnostic Hymn thing and I don't know if it took the money and didn't give what I bought or if the money just didn't get put into my account but when I tried buying it, it said that the transaction failed so I went to check my account balance because it didn't say ""Insufficient purchase"" and when I checked there was no money in my account. This makes me very upset and worried that it scammed me. I don't blame MiHoYo for it but if that is what happened I want it to be fixed please.",4
"I love this game. The gameplay is amazing, the story is interesting, combat is cool, and the graphics are beautiful. But, the lag and constant crashing makes Genshin a pain to play. Inazuma is out, and it‚Äôs great, except for the fact that it crashes every 10 minutes or so. (earlier it crashed every 5) I get why it lags and stuff, but it‚Äôs super annoying. I recommend regions could be map tabs kinda like Golden Apple Archipelago. Maybe only certain regions could be tabs such as Inazuma. Please fix the constant crashes Mihoyo!",4
"I really enjoy playing Genshin Impact! I‚Äôve unlocked a few characters and progressed well through the story, and it hasn‚Äôt even been a week! The lore seems interesting, and the game is like Zelda with a gacha aspect. 

The story itself makes me want to grind, and forget that I‚Äôve been playing for hours. Overall, the only flaw I‚Äôve hear about - but haven‚Äôt experienced - is that getting characters through wishing can be difficult. This free game is worth the space on your phone, trust me!",5
"Really liking it so far(downloaded it 3 days ago)! Wish it was easier for free to play players to draw AND obtain characters in the Wish system without saving up for a super long time. The game is also pretty laggy and my drops don‚Äôt work sometimes(I have to wait 30 secs for stuff to pop up for mining and chests) I‚Äôm playing on my phone so maybe that‚Äôs the problem...
But the graphics are super pretty and it‚Äôs really interactive! There‚Äôs so much to explore and I love that the game allows you a lot of freedom. 
Plus there is a lot of husbando and waifu material XD like omg the character designs are sick.",4
"I downloaded this game cause I got the new M1 iPad Pro and I wanted to test the graphics of it.  I IMMEDIATELY fell in love with this game.  Every day after school I find myself playing for hours.  The graphics are amazing and the storyline is OSCAR WORTHY.  The only thing is I wish we would get bigger updates.  It feels like the game was only exciting for the first 3 months it was out and then it got boring.  I would love to see more updates in the future.  Other than that, this game deserves an award.",5
"I have to say, this game is amazing. So amazing that I‚Äôm actually taking time out of my day to write a review. This game has beautiful art and graphics, characters, and storyline. I play it everyday and I love how you can play with others once you get to a certain level. Flaws are rare in this game except for some bugs. Genshin impact has lots of features and offers to make, so I definitely recommend to you and others. Have a good day :) thanks for reading",5
"This game has a really good story line and also an amazing open world map. Furthermore this game allows you to draw and gain new characters to play. Each character have their own unique set of fighting style. The controls are easy to use. This game takes time, although you have a lot of quest to play, graphics are amazing feels like you‚Äôre playing on a gaming console. Instead of skipping through the story line, each characters have their own set of lines they talk",5
The character development story and open world aspects make this game so addictive and fun by far the best mobile game I‚Äôve ever played I am only two hours into the storyline and I can‚Äôt stop playing the graphics for mobile also blows me away One tiny problem there is some crashing but that‚Äôs a very minor problem As win the game stops are you close out of the app it‚Äôs simply just puts you where you left off not to mention this game is completely free if feels like it should cost as much as a Nintendo game!,5
"Hello for the people getting angry at the game because of dumb reasons like the GB amount you best look at it first before complaining, also don‚Äôt force your rage at the game because of the small drop out percentage of 5 star characters. Overall I think this is a really great game at first I thought it was just some random game until I downloaded it, it had great graphics and I was so amazed and definitely worth deleting apps till I moved on to PC. Amazing music and sound effects and character design!",5
"I just started playing this game yesterday and for a FREE mobile game I think it‚Äôs amazing, the graphics are top notch and probably even better on pc, battles can be sometimes a bit challenging but that‚Äôs how any game goes. a couple things though, I wish there was a customization option I honestly think it would be so cool to have a shop and be able to buy certain hair or clothes and I think it would attract a lot of people to play. But other than that I absolutely love this game so far! (Currently on adventure rank 11)",5
"Polished and crafted to great proportions. This game feels like I‚Äôm watching an anime sometimes then I have to remind myself I‚Äôm controlling it. Shoutout to the voice actors for their time and hard work to bring even more immersive feeling to the game. The challenge curve is comfortable then turns up to push your studies to the limits. Being rewarded for nearly everything you do including reading non boring tutorials is very pleasant. The music is phenomenal, I mean truly mesmerizing at times. Enjoy at your own risk: this game is difficult to put down!",5
"Everything about this is so interesting! But, there is a problem with the audio. It‚Äôs extremely laggy when you come into the game when you download this and it‚Äôs your first time playing this. So I suggest to fix that problem. But the rest of the game is really cool! I love how this game is detailed! Everything thing about this is absolutely beautiful. So I recommend this for people who watch anime. But most importantly I really want you to fix the audio. I really hope this helped :)",5
"Okay, so I got finished playing the demo version of this game after finally caving in and downloading it (had to sacrifice an app or two to install it) and in all honesty... It‚Äôs not that bad. The visuals are really soft and colorful and the combat system is pretty good for a mobile game. 

There are just a few complaints that I have...
1. The intro to the game lagged my 6th Generation iPad and at first I thought my device wasn‚Äôt compatible (only come to find out that I was just being impatient).
2. The controls are a lot trickier as opposed to Honkai Impact‚Äôs, meaning whenever I try to go forward, I often find myself moving to the right or left (I will say that adding a system that lets you ‚Äòwalk‚Äô is absolutely awesome, bravo devs).

All-in-all, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. My only wish though, was that it was also available for Xbox One and not just PS4 (I mean seriously, 343 damaged Xbox‚Äôs reputation with Halo 5 so they kind of need a bone here).",4
"This game was the only game that I actually love to play, the graphics are incredible and the game is so fun. The only problem is on my phone, the area around you is black and you cannot see very far. This makes it especially hard for fighting monsters like ruin guards. Another issue is that my game crashes quite frequently, especially when I open the character screen. Other then these issues the game is incredible and 100% worth getting.",5
"I watched a streamer playing this and thought, ‚ÄúOkay this looks entertaining enough. I wonder how much it is.‚Äù Then I saw it was free. So I watched more. I ended up downloading it on my PC that night and I‚Äôve been playing for two weeks now. Wow. The amount of details on this game, the lore, the unique fighting elemental interactions, there is nothing I don‚Äôt like about this game. 
Wait.
Paimon.
Lol she‚Äôs like Navi‚Äôs talkative half. But even she has her charm. Thank you Mihoyo for making such an amazing game and having it free to play. That‚Äôs unheard of and amazing. I love it and stream it almost nightly.",5
"I am actually reviewing this game on the PC and not the mobile app, just because PC is far superior. You can play this on a budget laptop and it runs perfectly. Man what a beautiful game. Great music. Great voice acting. The world is vast and there is so much to explore so many secrets to unlock. Combat is addictive and can get challenging. Regardless of what people say you do not have to spend a single dime on this game to enjoy it! I‚Äôve seen some F2P accounts destroy spiral abyss. This game is worth your time to at least check it out. It‚Äôs FREE!!",5
"This game is great!... on pc. Genshin impact is a very well made game and is probably my favorite out of everything but this game is pretty much un playable on my phone you might not be getting these glitches, but on my phone the audio for everything is horrible. It cuts in and out it gets quieter and then louder honestly this would be the worst game in the world if it was like this but, on pc five stars! You might be wondering why I am rating this three stars when u just said five stars, that is because I am rating the mobile game this not the pc game. I hope this will help you to not be stupid and play on mobile and get these glitches.",3
"If you‚Äôre not playing this game then I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing with your life. The amount of effort and meticulous details put into this game is exhausting to think about. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs still FREE. Every characters‚Äô walk/run sounds different. Who does that? That‚Äôs just overzealous. The artwork: A-MA-ZING. The voice over: priceless (less reading). The gameplay: phenomenal. Who doesn‚Äôt love an open world to explore? Anime fans you got fantasy, adventurers, guilds, dungeons, and dragons üòÇ. Let‚Äôs go! If you‚Äôre still reading you‚Äôre wasting time. Download now!",5
I love this game. It‚Äôs honestly the best mobile game I‚Äôve played in my life but one major problem I have with the game is the adventure rank system. It should be easier to get your rank up and it shouldn‚Äôt take a whole day just to level up. Also there should be better ways to get your rank up instead of running around trying to find quests to use and instead do daily dungeons for lower rank players so they can get a good some of Xp and there should be items to double adventure rank exp when you get it. Finally thank you for this awesome game and I hope you see this and make this game even greater!,3
"For some reason a black void is surrounding my character when I try to play the game and the cutscenes are very glitchy. 

I looked it up on google to see if anyone else was having the same problems as me and I found out that many other people are having the same problem as well and many other people say the their phone/iPad still had a lot of GBs of memory left and are still having those issues and my phone too has GBs of memory left.

The only things that work are the inventory settings, my characters animations, controls and etc.",3
"Gameplay is fun and exciting but the only reason this game takes a long time to play is because you literally have to sit there skipping through every single dialogue you have with an npc and you have to literally WATCH the cut scenes, you can‚Äôt skip that. Then the stamina in this game is ridiculous. Takes way too long to regenerate and you use it way too fast. There should be a way you can like sit down to regain stamina faster. And there should be no reason why you shouldn‚Äôt be regaining stamina while you‚Äôre hanging on a ledge staying still... a lot of things make no sense in this game. They‚Äôre literally making you waste HOURS even DAYS on things that should take MINUTES.",2
"When I play on my iPad I play for a while it crashes when I teleport to some places sometimes even on my iPhone 11 I don‚Äôt know why Mabye it‚Äôs a bug but please respond or fix the bug if it one, Also when I updated my iOS to iOS 14 and then played this game the screen just turns white when I instantly click the app it used to work but now it doesn‚Äôt, Genshin impact works for iPhone 11 really good and handles the highest graphics no lag but when I even play on medium or low graphics it crashes on my iPhone 11 too.

Thank you!! <3",4
I started playing a couple of hours ago and without all the bugs it would been a 5 but there are a couple of problems with the game. I don‚Äôt know if anyone had else had this problem but it was laggy and would sometimes freeze. My surroundings are all black I don‚Äôt know if I have to fix the settings but everything is BLACK I can‚Äôt see my surroundings or the character. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the game‚Äôs fault but if there‚Äôs a way to fix please tell I would love to enjoy the game without these problems. Thank you very much appreciate,4
"I have Honkai Impact 3rd so I‚Äôm already familiar with how amazing these games are , I see Genshin impact is out and I got really excited I hit download took a long time to download and when it finally did I hit open and the screen goes half black half white and takes me back to Home Screen, I deleted the app redownloaded and same issue , i still have over 40GB of space so it‚Äôs not memory either , my WiFi is fine , my iOS is at 14.0.1 so it‚Äôs the latest  ,what am I missing ? I check the AppStore and it says presently an iPhone 8 is ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù to play, but not *mandatory*, then I check the compatibility and my phone (I phone 7 plus) is on the list, so for now do I have to wait for some fixes before I can actually play with the phone I have ?",1
"I like that we were able to talk to our co-op team or to friends wherever we had roamed. The emotes and stickers are all creative and some are funny, the costumes are unique, the music is too epic and lovable, the characters(& voice acting) made me feel satisfied about them, there are lots of fantastic & cool weapons out there, and events too. I also noticed that there was more to it than that.   I totally recommend this game, I am definite that the space it requires will not obscure the fun of this game.",4
"Honestly, this is probably my favorite game. It‚Äôs very addicting, due in part to the smooth mechanics, creativity of the developers, and overall high quality in sound and graphics. Although some parts (artifact farming) can be quite tedious and annoying to some, it‚Äôs still very fun overall, and can really help one relax, especially in the beginning stages. Definitely recommend. Do get this amazing game (just make sure you don‚Äôt build pity, or you‚Äôll regret it!)",5
"This is a great game. I‚Äôve only been playing it for a few months but I like it a lot. I wish it was a bit easier to earn Primos but I guess it is what it is.
With the real reason I wrote this review is to say I would like the developers to make some stickers that you can use in Messages. some other apps have them like a custom emojis. and I would like to have some of Genshin characters doing different things I could use in my messages. Thank you!‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I play this game on my iPad, so I tried to download it on my phone so I can play on the go, but I couldn‚Äôt due to the huge amount of storage this requires to play. I‚Äôm still playing through the game and can‚Äôt wait to see what comes next. I wish it took less storage but I do understand since the game has a lot of content and small details, so it makes sense it would take up a lot of storage.

TL;DR Amazing game but takes a lot of storage.",5
"This is honestly the best game I‚Äôve ever played. It‚Äôs so fun and addictive you just can‚Äôt stop. I just have one little suggestion. I suggest that since Fontaine is coming out in 2023 and that Fontaine is the hydro region you instead of making people wait til the end of summer you should make it THE big summer event. People will go NUTS over that it will be the most talked about summer event ever. Just a suggestion but it‚Äôs one that people would just love, so please take it into consideration. Keep up the good work.",5
"I have a short attention span and get bored of games easily, especially if it takes too long to get to the action. But Genshin Impact has both short and long quests, the ability to gather ingredients or climb a cliff, or do anything I want outside of the quests. I‚Äôm not limited to the quests, and I love the open world format. The characters are well designed, the storylines are super interesting, and I can play for hours, something I can‚Äôt do easily. I love Genshin Impact. Keep up the great work!",5
"The games open world and it‚Äôs mechanics are arguably the best for a mobile game. The game has seen significant improvement in quality of story quests and character creation, but a significant issue i‚Äôve noticed as a day 1 player is the that Hoyoverse has a diversity issue.

Specifically, almost all the characters they create are of a lighter ‚Äúwhite‚Äù complexion. While it is understandable that it is their game and they could do whatever they want, China as a whole aim to please only male chinese players ages 19 -29. Those men horrifyingly like to collect ‚Äúwhite‚Äù sexually appealing waifus. As a whole, the company seems to favor creating offensive characters. 

Sumeru for example is based on middle eastern cultures. The food options in cooking as well as story lore confirm this. However, there is no representation of skin color in any of the playable characters in this region. All of them are white.

They also disgustingly favor creating meta characters that are mostly women, just to appease the male gaze.",2
"This game is amazing I am a new player and the game already has my eye but I do have a little problem with it. I started to Xinging Quest but my phone died so I charged it,when it was fully charged again,I played Genshin but when I did the first step to the cooking showdown the golden button to show u where radish was wasn't there I tried restarting the game multiple times but it didn‚Äôt work. I hope that u can fix this bug so I can continue Xinging quest.",5
"I honestly love Genshin Impact, the graphics and storytelling are amazing even if a bit slow at times. Had you asked me a few months ago, I would have easily given this a 5 star rating. But‚Ä¶now Sumer is out. And I‚Äôm disgusted by the lack of representation in game.

Why are all the characters from the desert so pale? It‚Äôs like you tried to take the aesthetic but didn‚Äôt actually want to include proper representation. I can count in one hand how many dark skinned characters there are in this game, and for a game that‚Äôs set in more European based nations rather than America I had Hugh hopes for when Sumeru came out. I can only hope you do better in Natlan.",2
"After I tried to download the full version it said my storage was full so a made space for it and every time I tap the screen to play it keeps on sending me to this thing that says your storage is full, but before that it was crashing so much that I had to swipe out of the app and try again. Not only that but I had a hard time playing because when I moved the joystick my character moved too, but it was so LATE, and I even had to wait a few minutes for my character to actually move. Not to mention there is little colored colored characters this would‚Äôve been a three star if you could‚Äôve added some diversity.",1
"this is the only game I play. Me and my ex bff, ‚ÄúYuki‚Äù loved this game. We are now apart, me and my brother also love this game, 
As a 8yr old, I would love attacking games,
such as this, I love roblox, sword fighting, powers, etc.
I love genshin impact more.
it has all the things I love combined in this game, all the details~ anime dubbed voices~ characters~, etc.
Tgis is the best anime fighting game ever! I would definitely recommend,

there‚Äôs just some things I wanna fix, (if you can) 
#1:i DONT like the waiting screen that much, it has great details, etc, but it‚Äôs very long. So, I would love if you guys fix that issue I‚Äôm having.
#2: Bugs, the most important thing, I get it almost all the time!
#3: (nothing to say for now..)
#4: (nothing to say for now..)

"There‚Äôs countless commentary from not only Western fans regarding the need for diversity. Out of 50+ characters, there are only 2 with a darker skintone. Sumeru is a highly anticipated region like any other to keep the game running. New nations are what we look forward to the most with their new cast of characters. Sumeru is expected to be with a mesh of different cultures. It is not baseless to say Liyue is based off China and likewise with Inazuma based off Japan. Then why are the Sumeru characters disappointing, to say the least. Players have been waiting to see more diversity in the cast of playable characters. The two darker skintone characters are even just 4 stars to make matters worse. So please, listen to your players.",1
"Since I‚Äôve seen the leaks of Sumeru, you can already tell that the topic will be about the skin tone of the characters. I don't get why you made more than half the leaked Sumeru characters are much paler than the characters from Mondstadt and it shouldn't be that hard to make any character as dark or darker than Kaeya, Xinyan, and Dehya. Nor should any character be pale cause of some beauty standard in your or any country or because lighter skin sells better and in fact, all the characters with a skin tone that is darker than Kaeya or Xinyan have been a 5-star characters so you won't even let us even tell you what we want for the game. Hoyoverse you MUST do better in terms of representation of darker skin characters.",1
"Just to start off, this game is amazing and has been one of my favorites for almost 2 years.. The company however is‚Ä¶ something else. They do not care about the player base. Only what they can get from them. They refuse to give representation for the thousands of people that play and fund their games, they refuse to give end game content, there are PLENTY of quality of life changes they can make but refuse, and all in all refuse to listen to what the players actually want. 
This game is nothing but a cash cow for the company, they do not care how the players feel or what the players want and only cater to their CN players. Think twice before downloading and giving this company your hard earned dollars.",1
First off it is a rip off of Zelda then it is also a money stealer literally once you get to a certain level it‚Äôs just pay to win and if you don‚Äôt pay you have to grind for hours to get somewhere. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there you can‚Äôt get any rewards because if you do the game gets progressively harder and impossible to win. To add on to that it constantly glitches and if you are literally in the spot where it shows you in the quest it glitches and doesn‚Äôt continue the quest line. It also takes up 20 giga bites of space unless you delete every single game on your phone you can‚Äôt get the game. Overall horrible game don‚Äôt recommend.,1
"Okay so, I‚Äôve only had this game for less then a week and I love it!! It has great graphics and no glitches. I gotten a new phone so I tried it out on this one (was super glitchy on my iPhone 6), but with one of the newer phones it worked perfectly! 
Characters are unique and cute! One small concern, is that in wind gliding, you can see some of the (female) characters butts, which may not be suitable for all players, but I don‚Äôt mind it. Anyways great game and would 100% recommend!!",5
"Genshin Impact is a good wonderful game! I love it a lot. The game is super detailed, full to the brim with lore, and the characters are super like-able.
But that also means that it‚Äôs going to take up a lot of storage and I had to delete it off my phone to make room for other important stuff. I still have it on my ps4 but I can‚Äôt play genshin on the go now which is really sad. So if you want to, download the game it‚Äôs super worth it! But if you don‚Äôt have storage then-",5
"It‚Äôs an amazing open world game and it is very fun to play when bored and very entertaining but there‚Äôs only one problem. When I try to go back to play the game it logs me out and when I log back in it starts me from the beginning we‚Äôre there‚Äôs a cut scene telling me what‚Äôs going on and we‚Äôre I have to pick one of the twins. It doesn‚Äôt save my progress. If I don‚Äôt go on it the next day it logs me out and starts me over from the beginning as I said. Please fix this, it‚Äôs been hard playing the game with this bug or glitch.",4
"I love, love, love this game so much. It has helped me through when I am stressed and has become my comfort game. The game is full of amazing scenery and the game is absolutely beautiful. All of the characters are amazing and are designed with so many details including the sounds they make when they walk. The attention to detail in this game is immaculate. As well as the game itself, the fights and quests are also very fun including enjoyable events. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking to play.",5
"It‚Äôs an amazing game and I love it so much! I just wish it didn‚Äôt take up so much space on my phone though. I also love how you came explore so much as well. I‚Äôve been playing for about 6 months and still don‚Äôt understand how the wishing works though. I‚Äôve only gotten 4 star characters and weapons. I don‚Äôt know if you have to do certain things to unlock 5 stars or something. Still wondering if this game can be downloaded on Mac as well, but besides that I love this game so much and definitely will continue to play it!",4
"This game is so fun, and really helps me when I‚Äôm bored, I adore it. I do have a few issues tho sadly, it so hard and causes me to have a lot of stress. Especially the raiden shogun fight. And the fatui‚Ä¶ in Childers story quest, they are IMPOSSIBLE! I keep dying and dying over and over again‚Ä¶ and worst of all you can‚Äôt cancel the quests! And you can‚Äôt play in co-op when you don‚Äôt finish them üòï
Basically I will never play in co-op again üò≠
Still it‚Äôs very fun, just a bit to hard.
Also pain, I saved up and thought I was getting a five star, when it was just a five star catalyst that made my Barbra weaker :-: and I sacrificed her good catalyst for it üò≠
Also I don‚Äôt enjoy AR blocks in the main story.
Luckily I level up about every two days, so I don‚Äôt need to worry about that.
Anyways a great game, with interesting characters. Hope this wasn‚Äôt to rude!",5
"This game is a very good game and I would recommend it to my friends... but not the mobile version. My phone can barely handle this game and I‚Äôd consider my phone pretty good quality. This is clearly not meant for mobile. I tried playing the abyss on my phone. I couldn‚Äôt even beat floor 11 because of the amount of lag, compared to my time on PlayStation, I can finish it with 6-7 minutes left. Yeah... it‚Äôs that bad... 

Because of that, I have to rate it a 3 out of 5 for mobile. On PlayStation it definitely deserves 5 stars, but the lag on mobile is just insane and unplayable",3
"this is a beautiful game with a fun combat system. And if you don‚Äôt feel like doing combat, you can cook, collect wood for furniture, solve puzzles for chests or just explore! I also like the community. When I had a low adventure rank (something like a player level), a few higher ranked players would join my world and help me defeat bosses. The story is pretty nice, and the playable character system is good. Any character is good as long as you build them. Although I really want a dendro character haha.",5
"Beautiful game. Instantly reminds me of Zelda BOTW as far as graphics and the overall feel of  gameplay. It‚Äôs also very different from BOTW due to the different characters you can use and strategy in terms of using multiple characters as a team to complete events / earn accomplishments. 

Overall - Anyone reading this who hasn‚Äôt played this game yet should give this game a try at the very least. This is the first mobile game I‚Äôve played that feels like a $60 game on a console.",5
"this game is way too stingy with the rewards. they make millions off of this game yet we have only a CHANCE to get 100 primogems that‚Äôs not even enough for one wish and to even get a guaranteed four-star you have to have 10 wishes it‚Äôs ridiculous. Also, only few people will get that reward even though it‚Äôs the year anniversary. In general they rarely give out primogems so this game is heavily only for whales. I love the plot for this game but it is just too little. we deserve more considering how much money us as the players make for them.",4
This was honestly one of the most surprising experiences I‚Äôve had in a mobile game THATS FREE. I literally stop playing just so I could write a review and give credit where it‚Äôs due. I don‚Äôt know a lot about game programming and coding how you guys make so much happen as far as graphics is amazing. I know some people may have their nitpicks about the game but it‚Äôs honestly fun I‚Äôve put Kik 3 of my guys on it. And they don‚Äôt usually play games like these. This deserves 5 stars easily.,5
"I‚Äôve been playing since the game released and I have seen the game decrease in quality, the content is not there anymore. It‚Äôs boring, there‚Äôs barely any events anymore, the quest are more dialogue than actual activity. I‚Äôm a avid spender when it comes to the game I purchased the BP and primo gems on the regular but now I‚Äôm contemplating deleting the game. It‚Äôs extremely slow pace and it‚Äôs getting played out. There are many other issues with the game that have not been fixed nor addressed and that really makes me think the creators do not care about their audience or community. Sad because the game has sooo much potential to be better.",2
"Genshin is the best game I‚Äôve found that‚Äôs free. The music, graphics, character design, and gameplay really stand out. The story and journey through Teyvat is really well thought out. Other than taking up a large amount of storage and time, this game really is worth it if you appreciate what the game has to offer. There are some setbacks with the amount of grinding you have to do and the gacha system, but the things you can do in this game really out way those. Overall an amazing game :)",5
This is a really good game a lot of people say the creators are greedy because primo gems which are used to buy wishes aren‚Äôt given out a lot in the game which is not at all true there are millions of chances to get primo gems people who say the maker‚Äôs of the game are greedy are greedy  them selfs the makers of this game do not owe us anything. Do not listen to people who try to say anything bad this game is a 10/10 and you shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy it the story is great and the characters are awesome.,5
"I love this game, I started when it launched didn‚Äôt like it much, got back into about a month ago and enjoy it so much, but for a gatcha game having not just an anniversary but the first anniversary, and only giving us 1 10x pull and that‚Äôs it, nothing else, other gatcha games IE Pok√©mon Masters gives us I‚Äôll say 2-3 10x pulls every month(non anniversary) gives us all these rewards on .5, 1, 1.5, and 2 year anniversary‚Äôs, and all we get is 10 pulls on this games 1st ani. I thought other gatcha games I play were P2W but not even shilling idk 2 10x pulls and maybe even choosing a 5* character from a select few or even spicing up the towns to celebrate is just flat out disappointing. I‚Äôll change this review once this is changed.",1
"the game is good, i just think it's a really stingy gatcha game. they give out terrible rewards for daily commissions like 150 primogems when you need 160 for one wish. it really wouldn't hurt to give away FREE gems. it cost nothing so why be stingy with it??? next is the pity/ 5* drop rate. it's pretty low and takes awhile to get one. usually around 60-90 wishes you might get one but that's 1600 primogems 6 times or 9 times. for free to play players that's really hard to achieve without months of saving. the game itself is nice i like the plot and graphics.",4
"Mihoyo is one of the greediest and self absorbed companies I have ever seen. They could care less about the player base and don‚Äôt take any feedback or criticism. Don‚Äôt play this game, you will waste money and leave with a sour taste in your mouth. Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt respect it‚Äôs players and would rather milk them try or money then kick them to the curb. The anniversary rewards are a great example of this, no unique rewards, and the rewards they do give are so minimal that it‚Äôs a joke. And if you want additional anniversary rewards you will have to advertise the company on social media and their platforms to have a small chance at receiving a small reward. In conclusion, don‚Äôt waste your time with Mihoyo, they are greedy scum.",1
"The role playing aspect of this game is amazing and story is so entertaining and well animated. Unfortunately the gacha aspect of this game makes it really hard to get most of the characters you are interested in playing and even worse that mihoyo refuses to give generous rewards to help those who want certain characters. After a year of my time and money put towards this game, the effort given back is minimal and quite disappointing. I used to be obsessed with this game in the beginning but the game seems to be going off the deep end as it has gotten more popular. New events are repeats of old ones even at the 1 year birthday of the game so there is not much to enjoy or keep you interested in the game.",1
"as a long time player (ar 56 and played since launch) the company treats the community so horribly. extremely stingy and greedy, as a player you are out of luck if you expect them to provide you with anything helpful or free at any time. they only care about your money as a consumer and they make it extremely obvious when they cater the entire game to whales(high spenders). steer away from this trash game until they treat their customers better. for their 1 year anniversary they‚Äôre giving us 1 10 pull, which is basically 1 useless 4* and 9 useless 3* and thats it. for the entire anniversary. unprofessional and unheard of from a billion dollar gacha company MADE by its community. horrible game.",1
"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my device, but Genshin has a lot of crashing problems that I have to keep my graphics at the lowest. I don‚Äôt like that because I want to experience all of the wonderful graphics Genshin has to offer. You see, Punishing Gray Raven lets you put your graphics to the highest but it doesn‚Äôt crash. Is there any way you can do this to Genshin too? Maybe I‚Äôll consider giving a higher rating of this was fixed.",5
"Whenever I would I log in and go to the element loading screen it‚Äôs gets stuck on the geo element for along time. I‚Äôve tried deleting games, pics and even my software update for the genshin only for it to get stuck. I realize the bug been a problem for awhile for players, I was wondering if the devs can fix it. - Genshin player. 
Ps I also tried to contact discord helpers to help but no one reply unless their busy with other players questions then I understand",5
I playing the game on my iPad. The more I play I notice the app keep kicking me out when I middle of playing way to much I can‚Äôt enjoy playing it because that how much it dose that like now it gotten worse with this update not even 1min boom kick me then I have to keep clicking the app to start the game game and again way to much not only that I can‚Äôt enjoy cutscenes because it will kick my out again or it freezes so long the longest was 2 hours. I can‚Äôt keep doing this have to click back in to the app so many time I even put the lowest to run smoothly I even pay to get a huge memory for my iPad and it still does this allot please fix this. Thank you for your time and have a great day.,1
"I LOVE this game! I play it everyday!! The thing is, there‚Äôs this character named Xinyan and long story short she‚Äôs sticks out a lot. She has two puff ball with rock themed clothes and has this cool accent I can‚Äôt put my finger on. Well, she‚Äôs the only character without a story quest and it‚Äôs kind of disheartening because she has dark skin and in her voice lines she says she‚Äôs feared by others‚Ä¶ What I‚Äôm trying to say is, I really would appreciate a Xinyan story quest but considering the Inazuma update I‚Äôm pretty sure no one wants to go back to Liyue.. So I would really appreciate a Xinyan update..!",4
"It‚Äôs honestly a really good game and I recommend playing it. It‚Äôs just, it‚Äôs super laggy, and I saw another review saying it‚Äôs better on pc, my pc is only meant for my coding classes and a bunch of other coding things, and I don‚Äôt usually play on computer. On my phone it keeps kicking me Out of the whole app, at random times, and it became laggy, I had to let my phone sit for almost 2 hours just for it to load the ‚Äúfull experience/game.‚Äù It‚Äôs really fun don‚Äôt get me wrong, but maybe if it wasn‚Äôt meant for mobil, don‚Äôt put it on the App Store for mobil.",4
"Genshin is so entertaining!! I‚Äôm AR 43 and I play it almost everyday, and I almost never get bored. So much to explore and do. All the characters are great too, they can all be useful. Though I kind of wish that underleveled players can easily get enough materials to build characters and stuff. Or maybe some sort of warning to tell that the world level ahead might be harder because of most of a player‚Äôs characters? Just a thought though, I‚Äôd be fine without that feature. I don‚Äôt have much more to say, good luck working on the game!",4
"Genshin Impact has a great story line with also a lot of freedom to adventure the map. The character designs are amazing and they keep adding more kinds of characters almost every update. The game does take up a lot of storage though which makes sense because it‚Äôs mainly played on PC, which leads to getting kicked out from time to time. At the moment it takes up about 12 GB but that number will most likely grow a lot when the full story line is finished.",5
"I love this game and I play it daily but I find it extremely aggravating that I‚Äôm one only given one wish and on top of that get a weak word everytime. Like what‚Äôs the point of using wishes in the first place if the carahcters are impossible to get, for example qui qui, I have waiting MOUNTHS and the amounts of account I have made to try getting her is insane! Always the same weak sword. No carahcters. I hate the fact that I wayste my time makeing accounts over and over agian to get one thing and out of the MANY MANY MANY MANY MANYYY accounts I get not a single carahcter from a wish. Just the same sword over and over agian. Why.üòí",3
"Normally I would give this a five star rating due to its excellent graphics and ease of use. But with the latest update, this game erased ALL of my progress, sending me back to square one. I signed in and everything. It's ludicrous. 

Now, if I want to continue playing, I have to redo quests and re-establish teleport waypoints, earn powers and advance levels all over again, and rewatch many storylines. I'm not sure if this game is worth it if I can't hop back in where I had worked up to. 

If the creators could bring me back up to where I was, I would definitely change my review, because this game is super engaging and fun. It has cool challenges and worldbuilding, and the elemental fighting is exciting to learn how to use.",1
"Im not really into these types if games, and im the type to judge by the video and pictures if the game. This straight off the bat looked amazing! The graphics, the characters and people enjoying it made me download it. I wanted to play on my Iphone 7, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me, so I was mad for about (and still am i guess) for 3 days straight. I figured  I would try on my mother‚Äôs phone and it worked there! The problem is I dont see my mother often, and if i do, all we so is fight, so there really was no point.

The graphics look and are AMAZING, the characters look beyond beautiful with the outfits and all. Yes it lags on mobile, and takes space, but I guess it worth it. And i care about my space lol.

I wonder when you will release a new map and allow the game to be UNIVERSAL.

Overall, I really love it, and that‚Äôs saying something because i dont write reviews:) this is my first review:) PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT AND TRY! Great game :)",4
"hello, here‚Äôs some feedback. The game itself is amazing! It‚Äôs graphics on mobile could use work thought, but on PC it‚Äôs MUCHHH better trust me! The lag is prolly only for mobile players. So if you can/have a PC I recommend it on there. But if you don‚Äôt the mobile version is still good! The game is quite fun. The map is BIG! And I like how you can climb on things instead of having to walk around it. But some things I don‚Äôt like is how for some materials you have to wait for a certain day.",5
"Okay to all my fellow legend of Zelda breath of the wild players, I can tell that I‚Äôm not the only one who noticed that as soon as you start the story you can tell A HUGE CHUNK of the map was completely stollen from breath of the wild. Also A LOT of the monsters and creatures where copied, even the animations and patiala were copied like the map and its sounds, the markers and the energy bar. Like I can tell the creators tried to put their own spin on it but cmon be a bit more original. The only reason I rate this a 3 star and not a 1 or 2 is because the graphics are pretty good and for people who only play on mobile, this lets them have that Breath Of The Wild vibe.",3
When the game first came out my friend told me to play it. I said even tho it‚Äôs free I wanted to watch him play and see if it was any good. I saw that it looked genuinely fun and had lots to do. So when I got into it I went through the story and slowly started to realize most of the characters you see are locked behind an extensive paywall and you still need to have good RNG to get the characters in the first place if this game didn‚Äôt have that type set up I think it would be more enjoyable for newer playing to want to go to the end of the game and grind out all those hours to get everyone. Instead of paying to try your luck to get the good characters that will benefit you.,2
"I love almost everything about this game‚Äîthe open world, the soundtrack, how it‚Äôs friendly to free players who use their in-game resources wisely, the unique combat, the story, and more. However, as a married, Christian man, I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the level of fan service in the game. I know that many players find the sexual aspects appealing, but it ended up being a deal breaker for me. I don‚Äôt need to see jiggle physics or hear innuendos in order to appreciate what could otherwise be a perfect, revolutionary F2P experience. In fact, the sexual stuff was a deal breaker. If there were any way to disable it, I don‚Äôt think I would have needed to put down the game forever.",2
"This game is basically like breath of the wild meets gacha system, but in exchange there is no annoying weapon durability, plenty of characters to play, and a decent story. My only warning is that you should probably steer clear of npcs and the blue ! side quests, some of them can get incredibly dark, if your dislike sad things or are susceptible  to depression I recommend avoiding these two things. You likely won‚Äôt run out of content so if you don‚Äôt mind a bit of a grind or spending some money then this is likely the game for you.",5
I like this game but as I‚Äôm huge BotW (played for 440hour) fan I can‚Äôt give high score.. also my iPad gets hot to easy like other games such as Minecraft and PUBG makes my iPad hot when I play for 2 hour but this game makes my iPad in 5 min.  Also I heard about backdoor problem in this game which means it might take your primacy data from you. And gacha is too expensive like if you pay for gacha for 10 times it might be same worth as BotW.  But instead of BotW it has voice actor for every character for BotW there is no Korean voice actors but in this game there is voice actor but yeah.. that‚Äôs just only thing that I like in this game....I love this game but as I‚Äôm huge fan of BotW I can‚Äôt give you high score.,2
"Although the game is amazing, has great graphics, storyline, great characters, and overall a great game, the problem is just getting a 5 star hero is so hard to do, like I spent 5 wish 10x and haven‚Äôt gotten a 5 star. The next thing is that the game needs to make it to where if you bought the 30 day thing, they need to make it atleast 500 reward 90 is a little to low. That‚Äôs all the problem I have, although I have problems with the game, it‚Äôs still a every good game, prob one of the best rpg/adventure game I‚Äôve ever played or yet the best.",4
"The game itself is good but I hate the fact the my sight is limited to what I can see. I prefer if I can see everything instead of just black. I also hate the whenever I‚Äôm in water or when I‚Äôm fighting monster there‚Äôs this blinding light that makes it hard to see. And when there‚Äôs like a playback or something like that. It keeps freezing up. I hope the developers of this game can fix everything I just said but seriously other than what I said, the game is good, the characters are designed very beautifully, I love the characters voice, and I really love the game",4
Alright so I never write reviews on games but this one i have to write one because of how good it is. I never thought that a mobile game would have such good graphics while maintaining an open world type game. There are so many things to do and so many characters you can get. They are still adding more characters and they are not even close to done with the game yet. If there was a 6 star button to rate it It would definitely be 6 stars.,5
"I have no complaints, amazing graphics, fun story, good combat even if it is a little receptive. The whole elements fantasy theme is just my type. but the stamina is a little annoying and I have an suggestion. Please please add camping to the game like in final fantasy 15 and Dragon quest 11. Camping in games is so amazing. You can have like a training option in the camp, keep the cooking, choose time u can wake up, when you wake up everything is fully replenished, party chat. This would make the game even more amazing. Oh and also the OST in this game is BEAUTIFUL",5
"This game is amazing, absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs like Breath of the wild but anime. 
I can‚Äôt believe how smooth and beautiful the world is, the monsters, the animations! All of it is just breathtaking! This game doesn‚Äôt seem like it should be a mobile game but oh my gosh I can‚Äôt believe it is. 
If you love open world games, and liked breath of the wild even slightly I guarantee you‚Äôll love this game.
Game Devs Thank you for this game! Please don‚Äôt give up on this game, I‚Äôm currently deployed and can‚Äôt wait to try it on my laptop. Keep up the amazing work.",5
"So the game is awesome I love everything about it but one thing I don‚Äôt like is sometimes I‚Äôll like get a quest for a level 30 mission but I‚Äôm only like level 15 and then the quest is just stuck there for 25 years and it‚Äôs annoying. Maybe if you could figure out a way to like hide quests, and it like gave you a reminder every couple days that the quest was there and incomplete and you could just tap a button to make it show up again.",5
"I love this game. I love  characters and the amount of adventure the world provides. 
The combat is fun and you dont usually see this kind of game on mobile (open world and looks really good too) 
You do not have to pay to play, if you want to spend money you can but the game is able to be played completely free and still have a great time. There is tons of things to do everywhere you look and the story is amazing. 
Not to mention the worldwide community is amazing too",5
"This game is literally so amazing. it helped me open up to many things and i would love to continue playing it but, it takes up SO much space. It also makes my phone lag so bad, it would always kick me out of the game if i played too long. Thats okay, but when i tried on my ps4 it did the same thing. Other than that its an amazing game, i started around december last year and decided to quit (bc of the very bad lag) around two months ago. Im still apart of the fandom and would love to see the new updates.",4
I HATE that it has so much storage taking away from me. I literally am going to delete this game right now because I have to literally delete ALL OF MY APPS because of this stupid storage thing. Without this I literally will have a lot of apps without nothing telling me I can‚Äôt have that much. ANNOYING like I want to give this zero stars right now but I can‚Äôt so I‚Äôll keep it to a one. PLUS you guys have ALL white colored charactersüò≠ and only 1 is not whiteüò¢. At this point I‚Äôm am DONE. Like literally the entire fandom is getting hated on for 1 thing and it‚Äôs pretty big in my opinion. Heck no you should get this game it is to much. Go be free and get apps cuz this ain‚Äôt worth your timeü•∞. enough with the storage FIX IT NOW.,1
"I have been playing this game for almost a year, and I‚Äôve had so much fun, Something new to actually entertain myself! It‚Äôs just amazing, it‚Äôs storyline is really amazing. I just love it!! I really like the character and enemy designs too, 10/10! Definitely recommend, the gameplay‚Äôs really nice. I just wish we could get primogems faster‚Ä¶ Ahaha, but I really do recommend this game, ever since I was inspired by my cousin, I‚Äôve been obsessed! You all will really like this game. Have fun!",5
"So, I wish I could experience the game, but I can‚Äôt even get it on it tells me that I have poor network even though I have all bars and 14gb of storage left. Please fix your game so I can give it an honest review. I want to love this game but when I look at the reviews that are pushed down I see all of them have troubles playing. I deleted a heck of a lot of apps just for this app‚Ä¶.. it better not be for nothing. Let me tell you from what I've read : DO NOT GET IT ON MOBILE, there are a-lot of bugs and glitches that I‚Äôve read about. And not to mention the error codes..",3
"This game was like boring and a huge flop at first but when it went on a little bit it became FABULOUS, especially when you unlock a decent amount of characters. In a week of playing I unlocked Barbara, Syracuse, Beiru, Bennet, AND Noelle. This game is so nice with the gifts and you get a lot of primogems easily just because of maintenance and event gifts, the community is also so nice and friendly with beginners like me! 10/10, would recommend, made lot of friends and met lots of fellow gays, definitely should play",5
"Genshin impact is such a great game and I love it but I also have it on my computer. And when I try and purchase something it makes me have to go on my phone aka the original device where I first purchased the game. It makes me purchase things on there. The thing is, is that I don‚Äôt have storage so I can‚Äôt purchase anything really. So I suggest that, that should be removed or something. So then I can purchase things on my computer instead of having to go on my phone and purchase things on there.",4
"This game entertained me a lot I thought it was gonna be bad at first but then I told my friend to download it because it was so amazing I love all the graphics and details that you guys added
There‚Äôs one problem me and my friend are sad about.
We can‚Äôt friend each other because it says user ID doesn‚Äôt exist so please fix this! And I enjoy all the characters and weapons details scenery I just need you guys to fix this because me and my friend can‚Äôt find each other",5
"This game is not too bad but one thing I hate is the colors diversity for SUMERU specifically. There was supposed to be more dark colored characters but the closest we got was a tan version of Kandake who is originally a very dark skinned person, hoyoverse is scared to put different colors on characters because they want them to look ‚Äúcute‚Äù. How come the enemies are darker then the actual playable characters why are the bad guys the only ones with dark skin. This is unfair for many people who were hoping to get representation in the game it let them down this need to stop and get better because this is not helping anybody feel good about their skin color.",2
"Ok I get where you‚Äôre going with the skin color and etc. But be quiet it ain‚Äôt racist because it takes place in Asia , Japan, Korea and etc so be logical people they don‚Äôt have that many darker skinned people over there in Asia. So that‚Äôs probably why they don‚Äôt have much pigment also THEY Ain‚Äôt ALL WHITE PEOPLE SOME OF THEM ARE ASIAN. Now go play and deal with it that they‚Äôre mostly Asian and white people. Also half of the that are writing the bad reviews are children. Like come on seriously that‚Äôs just crap. Good day.",5
"I love your game, and I love Xiao. You made his story so interesting and his design so amazing, and his Voice Lines have so much depth to his backstory. You also did really good with Kazuha‚Äôs voice lines! The only thing I dislike about Xiao, is that he FREAKING MOANS in his English dub every second I‚Äôm standing. I‚Äôm also upset that Xiao‚Äôs growl was removed from the Japanese Dub. Other than that, I‚Äôve been playing this game for Months, and I love it. But please for the life of me, add more dark skin tones characters please and thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I have been playing Genshin for almost a year now, and It's been out for about 2 years. Out of the time I've been playing and the time it's been released I can't help but notice the lack of skin tone diversity. Which is extremely sad considering how much effort the character and background designers put into researching. The only two dark skinned characters in game barely have any content or show up in game, even though they both have very compelling background stories. I do not recommend this game due 
to the lack of diversity, it's truly disappointing seeing the new character designs. I might rate higher once they actually include more dark skinned characters and actually include them in game.",1
"Guys please this is embarrassing, complaining about color and stuff, guys its a game it‚Äôs fictional, it doesn't need to be accurate it bothers me seeing yall complain for such awsome charecters, like jesus grow up guys it wont make a difference in your life. Also like i would enjoy more colored charecters but honestly idc. This game is made in china what do you expect, all the charecters being tan? Bro chinese people are immensely strict with the colored people situation, i 100% bet hoyo wants to add much darker charecters, but they cant bc of the goverment üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ",5
It looks fun but I can‚Äôt play. My phone doesn‚Äôt have a lot of storage space so I can‚Äôt play. I don‚Äôt have a lot have games on my phone. I have tried getting rid of games so I can play but it still didn‚Äôt work. I have 7 games on my phone and I got rid of 4 and it didn‚Äôt work. I can‚Äôt remember the password for the other three so I‚Äôm not getting rid of those cuz I don‚Äôt want to lose my acc on them. I have been wanting to play for so long and I can‚Äôt. I probably will never be able to play. I have tried so many things and nothing worked. I really want to play but I can‚Äôt cuz I don‚Äôt have enough storage space.,2
"i've been playing genshin impact since update 1.1 in 2020 and the lack of diversity in culture/skin colors is worrying. the fact theres a whole new region based off of north african, middle eastern and south asian culture and the npcs have the exact same skintone as the ones in mondstadt is disappointing at the least. for a company that went as far to change their name under the guise of inclusion and diversity, its insane to see how lacking the diversity truly is in this game. giving proper representation and adding variety in skin tones and possibly even hair types would open so many new opportunities for character design. dont base a region off of a real world place if youre not going to go through the effort to represent that place correctly.",1
"Genshin impact  is such a fun game. I absolutely love it, but it takes up so much iPhone storage almost 15 gb. It also takes a while to download around 40 mins. Idk if that is just a problem with me, but my phone is basically brand new and the game crashed it. It makes my other apps lag a lot because it takes up so much space. Over all it is such a fun game and I have not been bored at all since I got it, however I only recommend if you have a lot of storage on your device. If there is any way to fix how much storage it takes, please do.",3
"Hello! I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since April of 2021, and I very personally love the game. But I think it would be better if there were more things for the people finished the current archon quests to do when they‚Äôre bored, like more adventurer‚Äôs handbook chapters or side story quests or hangout events. Once again it is still a great game and I would also suggest it not needing as much storage as it has, my phone is literally begging for storage space. Otherwise, that‚Äôs pretty much all for this review! Have a nice day!!",4
Genshin has made it easy to make friends within the community i wouldn‚Äôt have made if i didn‚Äôt ever give it a chance its a amazing game and don‚Äôt be scared by all those ‚Äògenshin is pay to win‚Äô scares.  You can build any character and make them amazing and you can really get any character you want if you prep enough and are prepared yes it can be frustrating sometimes but genshin overall has helped me through very rough points of my life,5
"This game I have had since 2020, so 2 years now. This game has been my all time favorite and it‚Äôs a game I play when I‚Äôm stressed and need to escape reality. The only thing that needs to be fixed is how to earn Primogems. For the commissions, I would say give 20 each and then when going to the Adventure‚Äôs Guild, you would gain 60. When opening chests, make them all 10. The events when earning primos are fine, just the commissions and chest openings. That‚Äôs all! Besides that the game is very good!",5
"i‚Äôve been playing this game for 8 months, and i‚Äôve never had a day where i didn‚Äôt feel like hopping on. from crazy luck on the gacha to rewarding challenges in the spiral abyss, this game always has something to offer me. 

even when i had just started out, i was stunned by the complexity and thought put into the world, questlines, puzzles, and combat mechanics. i‚Äôll never forget the wonder i felt when i walked into liyue for the first time. the music in every area is beautiful and atmospheric, the scenery is stunning, and no matter how long you‚Äôve been playing there‚Äôs always something new to explore.

while the artifact grind can be a bit tedious and some challenges seem impossible to overcome, this game is truly one of the most fun i‚Äôve played. definitely highly recommend.",5
The Game itself and the Devs are great and made an amazing game but if Managment/Corporate doesn‚Äôt start showing their Player base some love then this game won‚Äôt last. 1st anniversary just past with nothing but a cold shoulder and a slideshow of your progress. No communication leaves everyone to speculate with no real answers. Causing misunderstandings and a lot of angry fans just wanting to know what is going on and why We are being ignored. Do better! Devs and VAs your great keep up the good work we love you!,5
"Yes this game is AMAZING! I love it, my first account I made I was on it last week, but sadly my phone broke and before that I couldn‚Äôt remind myself to screenshot my accounts UIP so I‚Äôm logged out and scared I got hacked, I‚Äôve emailed the help system multiple times and got no help back! Overall yes the game is super fun and so far I got a few new characters on my alt account, but so far I‚Äôm trying to still get my old account back! I wish there was a different way to login besides using a UIP.",4
Genshin is made to be a free to play game with in game purchases. I agree a bit they shouldve done more with the rewards for the anniversary but god its messed up that you guys keep giving it bad reviews its an amazing game with wonderful characters and graphics and the people who are ruining that for other are the immature ones here. Im ar 52 and i started playing when the game came out please stop its immature to bring the game into it no one cares if u didnt like the rewards.,5
"The 1 star comments are about people not getting free stars‚Ä¶ like I play the game for free (haven‚Äôt bought anything) and its super fun! Specially since it‚Äôs a mobile game! People just want free stuff constantly‚Ä¶ mind you the game is free itself‚Ä¶ also the same comments are rude to the developers and make up stories about the company. Sadly the fan base is disgusting for Genshin Impact, and it‚Äôs probably going to stay that way‚Ä¶ cause its a free game people just download and are rude to other players constantly‚Ä¶",5
"this game will just make you go to h3ll, not good rewards while playing, have to spends DAYS or MONTHS just to get good stuff for your characters, is hard to get stuff to pull unless you pay 100 dlls for a good 5 star. The company has BILLIONS of dollars but decides to give 40 primos to everyone on their anniversary? You need 160 primos to make ONE wish, is not even enough. They have really weak security, literally everyone can get your information. This is just a waste of time. Mhy treat your plates better.",5
"What an amazing game, I love anime and this game reminds me of anime and fairy tale. I don‚Äôt play on iPhone or Mac but I love that they have found a way for an amazing graphic game to go on the iPhone. The only thing I dislike about this game is that you get characters by making wishes, and then 3 days later you meet the character that you got during the wish. Kinda weird but when your talking to these characters your, your own skin. But that‚Äôs the only thing. Love this game keep up the good work.",5
"I‚Äôm giving this game a straight up 1 star just for the anniversary itself. I‚Äôve played the console version since launch and here to say this game has many issue are Lady which I‚Äôll not state at this moment but the topic I‚Äôll definitely touch it this so called ‚Äú1st Year Anniversary‚Äù what a load of bull! You mean to tell us that this is how you truly feel about all your player base and people that have supported your game spending money for a year and this is how your repay us? No type of Primogems, No resin discounts for bosses or Ley Line events, or double dungeons artifacts rewards? Truly disgusting company I can happily say worst ever Anniversary I‚Äôve ever seen. Feel free to delete this review but I‚Äôll not remove it so others can see it.",1
Every time I attempt to play it I get to the loading screen where I am asked to download something in order to play it. Anyways so I do that and it says insufficient storage so I delete a few apps I don‚Äôt use and photos and videos. And i come back and I have saved up like 10 GBs and when I come back to download it‚Ä¶ It still says insufficient storage and the download is only 800 MBs. Please fix this so me and many other people can play :/,5
"I am a mobile gamer and this game looked fun and had great reviews so I installed it and it was great but‚Ä¶. The game crashed for me, a lot and each time it did I was forced into a 1-3 min long waiting screen.  This game also takes up a lot of storage, so much to the point where I have to contemplate giving up beloved games and memories just to continue.  I love this game, I really do but there are just a few things that are not very good",5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this game is amazing. The graphics, the characters, the story, the action, the gameplay, all of that is absolutely stunning!
My problem is that it crashes way too often. Sometimes I can‚Äôt go 10 minutes without the game crashing. This is probably my tablet‚Äôs fault (it is a bit old), but if it is a problem that others are experiencing, that is something that you guys should work on a bit.",5
I love this game so much I bought it when it was first released and my interest in it has not wavered at all. I recommend this game to everyone. Everything about it is spectacular! The character designs and the graphics and music choice is all so soothing and well put together. I lay this game for hours on end and although it gets frustrating sometimes (like every other game) it‚Äôs still so much fun and I‚Äôll probably continue to play it from now until very far into the future,5
Okay so I know you guys are probably busy but I need help abt the wish lanterns that‚Äôs are going on today February 19. So I signed up using my Game Center account and I tried to enter the event and tried to login using my Game Center information but it‚Äôs not letting me and When I tried to register it also didn‚Äôt work so I‚Äôm confused as to why. If your able to sign up\login using Game Center shouldn‚Äôt that information work for the game? I was going to put this on the discord server but when I went to the link it was expired. Pls help,5
"i‚Äôve been playing this game since october; i own all the 4 stars in the game, own all but three of the 5 stars, i‚Äôm adventure rank 50, etc etc. i LOVE this game. the graphics are beautiful and the story is very interesting. it‚Äôs so fun to grind and farm and overall has aspects every player will love. there‚Äôs so many characters to fall in love with that are all fully fleshed out and brought to life. the soundtrack is AMAZING and it‚Äôs so peaceful. i recommend everyone to get this game because it‚Äôs so fun and mind blowing!",5
"One of the most expansive games I‚Äôve ever seen offered on mobile. Graphics are actually beautiful and it offers hours of gameplay. I never get bored of it. The only issue I have is that when I reached level 25, it just stopped letting me level up past that point. I can see that I have enough points to have leveled up a few times by now, but I‚Äôm stuck on 25. I assume it‚Äôs just a glitch, and it honestly hasn‚Äôt steered me away from the game that much. It‚Äôs still amazing.",5
"Ok so first of all, this is literally the gacha best game I‚Äôve ever played. The graphics are beautiful and the character designs are just amazing. Let alone the AMAZING soundtrack and storylines. While you can spend money and it can be convenient at times, the game is just as fun to play when your F2P. (Another random but very useful thing is the different platforms it‚Äôs available on, not tons of actually fun gacha games are playable on mobile like Genshin Impact is. So I appreciate it) The game is overall very well thought out and really enjoyable to play!!",5
"Just down pack perfect! I Love it and it‚Äôs breathtaking I have no complaints just maybe a list of what I need to do and go like objectives to complete but still amazing and great!‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç

Update on the Review: So I still like the game but was wonder if somehow you can add a character customization option adding more than one race it‚Äôs kinda weird that it‚Äôs only one which is shown in the game which is confusing and is a important detail to be set in a realistic world. 

So customizable options would be from skin color to type of hair style and all that would make me and probably others appreciate the game and developers a little more.

But still the game is fun.
Thank you!üëç

Update review 2nd time: but the check points are missing on some of the maps and is quite frustrating because their not visible and decreases my progression for quick traveling.",5
Great game lots of adventurous storyline and a great way to connect with friends once you are a certain level. One thing I would like to see more of is a little bit more explanation on adventure bank because when I was trying to complete the first temple it said I neededAdventure rank 12 but then after I completed two other temples and went back to the temple at adventuring seven I could enter I would love to see a little bit more clarification on quests,5
I love this game! I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but I will write in for Genshin Impact. The art in the game is beautiful. It has a great storyline and soundtrack to go with it. I usually turn off the sound on games I play but I have left the sound on for this one cuz it‚Äôs so good. I love the multitude of characters there are and the skills they possess. I love that I can play co-op with my friends and that we can do some quests or exploration together. I would say I‚Äôm addicted to this game it‚Äôs so good! I can‚Äôt wait to play it when I get home!,5
"Ok so this game is amazing and I now play on a computer, but when I first tried to get it, i was on my iPhone 6 and it didn‚Äôt work, i realized that far into the description of the game it says works with iPhone 8 and higher, but I doesn‚Äôt tell you that when downloading the game so it kept lagging me out during the first part of the game and i spent a few days trying to get into the game. I love the game but I think that they should say somewhere easier to find that it doesn‚Äôt work with iPhone lower that the iPhone 8",5
"See I came to play this game by people really hyped it up before it came out, then it came out so I decided to do it. Honestly I have no regrets whatsoever! One thing I suggest for the game is can we have guilds that the players can create? Not just the adventures guild but a guild that players can start. I‚Äôd hope there would be another type of ‚Äúcommission‚Äù just it ain‚Äôt a commission, it‚Äôs something that can help the guild, and still give you xp. Anyways I‚Äôd like to see how childe switches his weapons in the future!",5
"I‚Äôm absolutely mesmerized by how much is in this mobile game! It feels like legend of Zelda meet Assassin‚Äôs Creed. Excellent story and side gameplay and even though the graphics are more limited on a mobile device (compared to the gaming consuls) they‚Äôre still excellent! If you want to level up quickly, you can pay, but I am somebody who likes to work hard to get my way up, and that is still possible in this game. I probably will buy something at some point just because I would like to support for this RPG!",5
"I LOVE THIS GAME but there a few things I don‚Äôt like,always needing to update,logging me out every time I go in the game,kicking me out. Now some of those things mite be a me thing but it‚Äôs still annoying, over all it‚Äôs  a great game,in a way it reminds me of zelda breath of the wild(great game btw you sould play it but anyways) the only dif is that u use magic in this game- but it good-oh and SAVING omg it‚Äôs not the great is‚Ä¶but over all it‚Äôs very fun this is a good game. 

Ps ( my phone is like 3 years old all of those problems are a me thing, accept for the updating part)",4
"I wanted an app that was fully open world and you could pretty much do mostly whatever you wanted. One where you have no limits of what you can and can‚Äôt do in it. One just like DragonRaja. But for this particular game, all I wanted is something at least similar to that game. Which I am totally happy with. But this is besides the point. The MAIN reason I am doing a review on this and am giving it a one star, is because of the screen going black/white, or just completely white for that matter! I would like to give it a 5 star but I won‚Äôt until this issue is addressed and fixed. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if you did!",1
"Surprised that a mobile MMO would get my attention, after many failed attempts to play others. Genshin Impact really outdid itself with giving you just enough content at the beginning and not too much pointless items/quests at the beginning. It really grabs my attention and I'm currently playing it at 1:30 AM. Surprised to see 60FPS handle so well on my 11 Pro Max.  This game's customization and story telling is simple and to the point with more than enough lore and characters to keep you hooked in late at night.",5
"I‚Äôve played TONS of ‚Äúgacha‚Äù games. I got so sick of them. All the same. Fun, addicting, exciting at first. Then you get to a point where you literally have to spend hundreds to progress at a reasonable pace or be competitive. This game is DIFFERENT. It is actually a well made game, with GOOD content. Their are tons to explore, combat system is fun, and they give tons of free premium currency. It‚Äôs very similar to Zelda: BOTW but with IMO a better combat system. F2P players are never inclined to use micro transactions and they NEVER shove it in your face.",5
"This game is something you would dream of piecing together. Great story, enemy variety, vast gorgeous world and a big array of dungeons, weapons and characters to choose from. Started playing a few days ago and I can‚Äôt put it down. A lot of people are claiming that the game is pay to win but I have yet to spend a dime on the game. Just grind and be very thorough when you traverse the land. Amazing job to the developers and I hope that they continue to build off of this and keep it going. Thank you",5
The game is by far the best mobile game i‚Äôve ever played but there are still somethings i think you could add since the game is still in beta version. It would be very nice to add a transport form such as horses or anything like that. Also something that i think people would really like is changing armour and armour appearance it would be very nice because it would bring up more RPG style to the game. Apart from those 2 things until where i played the game is extremely good keep up the good work. üëç,5
"Game‚Äôs pretty fun, but unfortunately..

As I‚Äôd heard it said by an anonymous user online, ‚Äúthis game is so good, it shouldn‚Äôt need a predatory monetization system akin to lower quality mobile games that targets cash whales and gambling addicts to be successful,‚Äù but it has one anyway. 

The gacha in this game is simply unforgivable, and after my experience with Honkai Impact 3rd, I‚Äôm tremendously disappointed with the direction this company‚Äôs chosen to follow in Genshin Impact. 

Assuming you‚Äôre unwilling to wait the several months it would take you to Payless-ly acquire the 90 rolls it would take you to guarantee your first 5 star, (which otherwise has a .6% chance of being rolled on any banner,) we‚Äôre talking a price point of $1050 to get you through those rolls and guarantee you a COIN TOSS on whether or not you‚Äôll get the unit you actually want.

Regardless of whatever this game brings to the table, no game should be allowed to pick the pockets of their player base in that way, and I will not be giving money to this studio again so long as they continue these kinds of practices.",2
"So basically this game looks great I played the demo I find it super addicting **cough not me staying up till 4 playing it** Um why can‚Äôt I download it on iOS the update I‚Äôm so sad that I can‚Äôt get the update on it is there a way you can fix it? If so please do tell me if you fix it please üôè I wanted to play this game so bad btw I like that this game is like breath of the wild that‚Äôs cool I also expect R o m a n c e in this story üòèmaybe-? Anyway if you can‚Äôt fix it that‚Äôs okay
Have a good day!",5
"The game is absolutely amazing, I‚Äôm addicted, the only thing I hope they had is to be able to customize the controls for mobile devices a little more. Sometimes I tap the wrong button. For example I‚Äôll jump while trying to sprint, or attack while trying to jump. I wish they would allow you to adjust the size and placement for these buttons",5
"Ive been playing for over a year now and ive gotta say, this is the BEST GAME you can play if you have enotgh time on your hands!! I love the storyline and you can earn diffrent characters based off of pity and a gacha system, but there is one tiny thing, Primogems and Fates are pretty hard to get unless you‚Äôre a diehard player. Now that there‚Äôs a permanent event im hoping we could get primos, mora, and other resources from it that are a bit difficult to get! Other than that it‚Äôs an amazing game :)",5
"So this game is very fun, and honestly whenever I get a new game I think like about genshin graphics and how much better they are. But I rated 4/5 because after a while, if you want to do the main story quest, first you must talk to this npc, and the npc is busy doing another quest, so it often takes a while. Thought this is more of a me problem for getting the 2nd quest to begin with, I just wish that npc‚Äôs could be in 2 quests at once. Over all thought, definitely one of my favorite games!!!",4
"This game is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Without it I‚Äôd probably would‚Äôve offed myself. There are a few things that I would like Hoyoverse to change like the skin tone representation, anniversary awards being a little better, and the resin cap would be from 160 going to hopefully 200. It would make the game a lot more like able, not only by me but by other people. Though this game has some downsides that could be overlooked, it is a very fun game and always seems to brighten my day(besides when I get Keqing and Mona).",4
"So I haven‚Äôt played the game in like months and I reminded myself that I spend a lot of cash on that game so I decided to play I got in my account and guess what?, my journey and all the story‚Äôs I‚Äôve finished restarted all over again

I wanna say why did it happen is it because I haven‚Äôt played in a long time well it‚Äôs not my fault I had to get a break, all I wanna now is why did you deleted all my journey and the characters I‚Äôve got all the way from the start like this is was really surprising and mostly annoying cuz the fact I‚Äôve spended a credit card money on that so this game can make you restart all over again if you leave it for like 5 or 4 months",1
"I love Genshin impact because the storyline never ends and you never run out of things to do, this is a game you‚Äôll never get bored with. I have no issues with this game and out of all nine months I‚Äôve played it has had NO ADDS! I highly recommend you downloading it. If you want a game that you won‚Äôt get bored of because you usually do the same thing all the time in other games, I say that this is what you should get. Genshin impact totally slays.",5
"This game is so fun I luv the graphics the characters I always complete my stuff a little a little expensive too many hard bosses and I cant get inazuma but I‚Äôm working on it :D I luv the fighting scenes the actions the quest and the story lines every thing is so beautiful I really want my dream characters also primo gems when is the event coming because I really want primo gems to get Childe ,ganyu,hu Tao,Xiao,Ayaka, ayato, and raiden sho gun but the most I want is Childe <3 so yea that‚Äôs what I wanted to say like I said it‚Äôs very beautiful.",5
"Overall, I love this game (especially venti :3) except for the storage problems. I get that this game takes up a lot of storage but most people including me only have Genshin impact on their devices from all the storage it takes. I had to delete all of my photos yet again it wouldn‚Äôt let me play. If the developers could somehow find a way to fix these things, I would be very happy and willing to waste more money on this game. Please and thank you.",5
"Honestly, genshin is a really great game but the main problem that I and many other players have is that updates require so much storage. I had undownloaded genshin but decided to redownload it again for fun and to see if I‚Äôd get motivation to play it again but I keep having an insufficient storage error even though I practically deleted everything off my device. I even looked up solutions and followed them to a T. It is so stressful and I hope it gets fixed soon. I would also at least like to know some possible ways to try and resolve the issue because I can‚Äôt even load in to the game and play.",2
"I‚Äôm on an iPhone 12. It can handle Genshin on really great settings. But I‚Äôm playing on a phone. I have really been wanting a switch release as I have a switch and no playstation or pc. So, I got a Roku so I could play on a TV and connect an xbox controller to the game and play on a tv. It works for about 20-30 minutes, then starts to really slow down as my device gets too hot. This happens in or out of my phone case. It has taken the amount of time Imm able to play down significantly. If a switch release isn‚Äôt coming soon, can you at least fix the mobile platform to be able to support in the mean time?",2
This game is the best game I‚Äôve ever played but there‚Äôs a few things I think that for people who don‚Äôt wanna spend money on the game don‚Äôt have to work so hard to get primogems for pulling for characters so I recommend maybe lower it to 80 primogems and there‚Äôs a bug I keep getting where a hillichurl with a shield around it when it teleports the head goes oh it‚Äôs chest for a second but that‚Äôs all I have to say great game hope the updates keep going on,5
"Genshin Impact overall is very accessible and fun game, the only problem is it only lasts for so long. It takes A TON of storage and after getting past AR 50, there really isn‚Äôt much to do. It‚Äôs hard to start if you haven‚Äôt started early because you have to do stories to unlock materials to use your characters. So it‚Äôs fun at the beginning at least if you can figure out how to get far.

Also despite being a game with lots of different regions and cultures, they‚Äôre representation isn‚Äôt great. Lots of pale white, super skinny people and basically nothing else :/",3
"The game itself is really good along with the storyline, however I would like to bring up how much space it takes up to download and update it. Yes a function is coming out to delete future quests but in order to get that function‚Ä¶ we have to update it, do we not? Which will only add more to the limited space we have already from just simply downloading the game. Imo this game isn‚Äôt really meant for mobile with all the new updates and the huge amount of space it takes.",4
With an amazing opening and adorable characters this game is now one of my favorite starting off you get a very helpful tutorial and it will help you throughout the entire game you will meet a character in the beginning that will stick with you through all of your struggles!! Getting further I to the game you will find more adventures and much more fun and new characters you get along the way!! Overall I enjoy this game a lot and I have only started today!!,5
"I‚Äôm very glad I started playing! The game is very enjoyable!! I love adventure and fighting games!! If you also like those types of games I recommend genshin! It‚Äôs very fun,but I must admit sometimes I get stuck doing the quests and challenges for a while,yet the challenge is what makes this game so exciting! Amazing story,gameplay,designs,and overall amazing game!
Why not put five stars? Well,the stamina gets used up pretty fast but luckily it recharges just as fast! The devices I suggest are any apple device,PC,and of course play station!!",4
"The character designs of Tighnari, Collei, and Dori are all extremely pale skinned despite their base regions of South Asia and the Middle East being regions FULL of people with darker skin. Not to mention, all of the NPCs present in the game that are from Sumeru are also pale. Dori‚Äôs design is also orientalist. It looks like something straight out of Aladdin and should be better researched to properly fit the region. In fact, all of the characters shown so far for Sumeru need to be looked over, so Hoyoverse can do proper research on how to portray these kinds of regions correctly, and just do the simple thing of making characters have darker skin if they‚Äôre based off regions with people of darker skin. It‚Äôs not hard to be not racist. Do better Genshin Impact.",1
"There is little to no representation for darker skin tones in genshin impact. No matter what the ethnicity of the character is they keep on putting out characters that are light complexion or out right white washed. And for the few characters they have that are of a darker skin tone, like Xinyan, and Kaeya they constantly white wash them in their official art work. I will not keep playing this game unless there is better representation, especially with newer regions that are supposed to be based off of people with darker skin tones. If there is no representation with the following regions I will be forced to delete this game, as someone who has invested a considerable amount of money into it. This is very colorist of you hoyoverse, and I will no longer support.",1
"This game is wonderful in its open world puzzles, and mechanics. Many of the stories are in depth and captivating. 

Problems:

Their cast of characters lack any kind of diversity. Every single npc is white or lightskin asain. Npcs from Sumeru, a north african and south asain based region, are all white. Its disrespectful to the audience, and people from those places to be whitewashed and paled to the potential of rich diversity and characterization.  Urging for all players to be more thoughtful of their consumption of fantasy media, for it always falls short for these countries who have previously in history been ridiculed and used for money. Don't fall for orientalism. It benefits no one other than the company. Do research, and don't be afraid to diversify.",1
"It‚Äôs honestly a great game. It surprised me when I first started playing with its amazing graphics and soundtracks, however it takes up SO much space on your device. If you have a device with 64 gb or lower, this game will not last long on said device due to its massive amounts of data and with its constant updates (which just add more gb to the app‚Äôs overall gb count).
I recommend it if you have the space for it, if not, you can still play it, but probably not as long as you may have anticipated.",4
"This is low key one of the best game‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever played. The only thing I would change would be rolling a 5 star more likely. But, I won‚Äôt deduct a star from that. The map is so open. And keeps you entertained for months (unless you beat it). I would 100% get this game, and just so you know ppl who haven‚Äôt played, you can choose a new server for a retool account. Just wanted to get that out there, cuz it took even meh awhile to figure out.",5
"I really love this game. I suggest you guys playing it!
The game is addicting and has a very interesting storyline that wants you to know more. The graphics is definitely on point and the gameplay in general is very good!  Genshin Impact has cute and unique characters. The designs on the characters is beautiful! 
Not only the character design, the scenery in the game is also awesome! Teyvat is a very interesting world.
‚Äî‚Äî
The gacha system is good, but sometimes I think it‚Äôs upsetting to wait 50-90 pulls for one 5 star character‚Äî",5
"Genshin impact is great if you want the kind of games that are rpg. There‚Äôs lots of quests you can do and the archon quest are really exciting and interesting! You can also wish in the game which can give you weapons or new characters. To add on, you can get starglitter from some of the wishes. And you can get other things too! I play this all the time on my tablet and it‚Äôs really addicting. You can play on mobile, PC, computer (etc.) I probably play it every second ü§†ü§†",5
"So this is a really good game for open world players, but I dislike the amount of‚Ä¶. ‚Äúsuggestiveness‚Äù in the game. Pretty much all of the characters are sexualized. But what do you expect, it‚Äôs anime. The game has few flaws but one of them is co op. That could be improved. Other than that, the graphics and gameplay are pretty nice. There are a lot of controversies about this game from the fan base, which I suggest you ignore because most of them are just fueled by needless drama.",5
"I love this app. When I was looking for something to play, I found this, last year when it first came out. I loved it so much!! Everything about this game is just wow. The only thing that is a bit difficult are the wishes. You get lucky sometimes, or sometimes you don‚Äôt. It just depends. 20% chance of getting lucky, the other 80%, forget it. But overall, I love it and will always keep playing it! I hope you never cancel this game.",5
"Genshin is just‚Ä¶WHOA! 

When I first stepped into this game, I wasn‚Äôt expecting too much from it. Now I‚Äôm AR 47 and always enjoying the new updated and characters. The story is unbelievably amazing and the characters are a variety of personalities. This game makes me want to cry and smile at the same time, it‚Äôs that amazing. Also the open world and the variety of music is just a happy sensory time. Overall would recommend to people who love fantasy RPG‚Äôs that aren‚Äôt too crazy in the fantasy.",5
"I used to play hardcore MMORPGs before this so I was surprised at how much I loved Genshin Impact!

It's a very chill game but extremely well-made, including the graphics and music. I love how I can play it both in mobile and PC (I play in PC when fighting the more difficult bosses). I wish they will keep improving coop performance because playing with friends is always the most fun.

There's a new update every 6 weeks so I'm very happy with the content and I hope Mihoyo keeps it up!",5
"This is an amazing game, i love the music, story, scenery, and characters designs. I‚Äôd give this game 5 stars if it took up less space. i deleted everything on my 32GB phone and all that‚Äôs left is my System and this game and the undelete-able apps. Yet there is an issue where i‚Äôm unable to update the game because i have the perfect amount of storage left. it just needs to download 40mb left of space when there‚Äôs 50mb of space left. i‚Äôm sad now‚Ä¶",5
"this is my all time favorite game and i‚Äôve only had it about a week! i love exploration-adventure style games already, so it was right up my alley. the pacing is great (there‚Äôs been so many updates and i started playing late but i don‚Äôt feel rushed or overwhelmed at all) and the characters are great!!! i love all of them but paimon is really annoying‚Ä¶no big deal haha all genshin players of course know what i‚Äôm talking about ;) the fights are challenging but engaging and the overall gameplay is awesome",5
"I decided to give this game a try because of all the hype and- ITS AMAZING! I finally found a game that makes me think and keeps me coming back! You never run out of things to do, and the story is interesting. It starts out in a slower pace (not too slow) for beginners so you can slowly figure out how to navigate and play. You might want to do a little research to understand the different in-game currencies, but other than that, just go with the flow and have fun! :)",5
"The game itself has great story great combat and pretty good graphics for a mobile game, if your debating to get it or not cause of storage get it‚Äôs worth it no matter why your debating just download it‚Äôs great and has tons of bosses and new coming soon!
Just download I‚Äôve been playing for a week now and it‚Äôs the best game I have ever played on mobile and on all platforms except Xbox. That‚Äôs the only bad thing that it‚Äôs not on Xbox but hope it will soon. Anyway that‚Äôs my review and JUST DOWNLOAD!",5
"Hi Mihoyo. I love your game but this is a serious thing that‚Äôs needs to be fixed. When I try and download the new update it doesn‚Äôt work and it just stays at the downloading screen. And I really wanna wish for Thoma. I have never been so mad and sad in my entire life. Anything else works BUT GENSHIN. I really like this game but it‚Äôs annoying and I really wanna download the new update. So please fix this. I really wanna play the new update. And I wanna play with my friends, and my mom. Thank you

- Anonymous",5
this game is amazing and i‚Äôm obsessed over this game but since i play on ipad it take up a lot of storage and i genuinely don‚Äôt have a lot of storage but it took about 13 GB of my storage and i had to delete some apps so this game to download i understand why it takes up so much storage but i was wondering if you can try and make it were it doesn‚Äôt take up that much also when i do play the game it logs me out randomly and i have good internet connection and so does my family but it just logs me out me out randomly,3
I‚Äôve been playing this game almost since it first came out and writing my first review on the game. It‚Äôs honestly a great game but wow it‚Äôs been down hill since end game. I‚Äôve spent so much money and time on this game I can‚Äôt even imagine how upset f2p player are. With the release of each new character you‚Äôd be lucky to even get enough primos for a single 10 pull. It‚Äôs sad honestly. Would it hurt that bad to be a little more generous to the players that have been so generous to you?  Losing a star each update the greed continues.,4
"Now,
I‚Äôm a person that is AR 55, I‚Äôve made countless friends on there but this one event.

The anniversary rewards.
This just pisses me off, your giving your own fan base, which made you a thing here.

You pretty much just redid the ‚ÄúXiao lanterns‚Äù Event.
I was believing that you would say this wasn‚Äôt the only other event where we get the wishes and type of stuff.
But nope, I guess my expectations were too high.

I heavily hate how you are a milli-billionaire company, but reuses the same event. Do you even try Mhy?

It makes sense why some people are leaving,
Lack of endgame content, the events reward are almost always terrible, this game is mostly P2P.

I‚Äôm so close to just quit genshin, I really love this game.
But just seeing you guys redo events, I heavily hate that.

Also I would just like to mention that there are WAY better Gacha games out there,
If someone is reading this I suggest playing Cookie run: Ovenbreak or Cookie run: Kingdom.
The people who work for that company are really sweet, and way more better than Mhy.

This is my last hope, just please notice what people say Mhy.",1
"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews for things but from the moment I started the game, it was different from all games I‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve easily poured hours upon hours into this game. It‚Äôs got everything from a great range of characters, graphics and art is stunning, music is fantastic, weapons, thrilling boss fights; it‚Äôs got it all. I‚Äôm a pretty casual player not really taking it too seriously but also at the same time, easily one of my favorite games. I do not regret downloading!",5
"I don‚Äôt really have much to say about this game because I never got to even play it. First of all, it took over a half hour to load everything, and once everything was loaded it would not let me play the game. I tried to play and it would just kick me out of the app every time. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just my phone or something but this was really disappointing. I saw many good things about this game so I was really excited to play it. I bet it‚Äôs a great game, I‚Äôm just sad I didn‚Äôt get to play it.",4
"Objectively speakimg, the game itself, including character design, gameplay, graphics, storyline, and music, is great. However, there are a lot of problems with this game. There is no late game content, and MiHoYo does not seem to care much about it. The game requires a lot of grinding, which is okay, but there is like a stamina system to force players to pay if they want to grind. The recent controversy showed that MiHoYo does not want to communicate with the player base and does not give any appreciation towards them. Beware of disappointment if you want to invest in this game. In a conclusion, it is a great ‚Äúfree‚Äù game if you do not take it serious. However, do not pay for in-game content because your money is not appreciated AT ALL.",1
"Soundtrack and world building are top of its class. That‚Äôs how they trick you into staying on this game despite all of the glaring issues that the game has with long-term players. This game has much potential, but instead of using profits to fix issues about the game and making it better for the player, the company is content with keeping things as is and raking in the cash. Do NOT support this type of predatory practice. This game/company has shown time and time again that it does not care for its users. Find a game that communicates to its players and feedback, and that is designed around keeping players happy, as opposed to farming them for cash.",2
"Amazing game, I‚Äôve played it for a full year now. It‚Äôs had it‚Äôs fair share of problems but Mihoyo had tended to be good with listening to the community.  It has its fair share of problems with the monetizing of characters, and even in game play time but it‚Äôs had plenty of events to make up for it. Since it‚Äôs lack of endgame, they keep us entertained with whatever they can come up with to include a rhythm game. Now anniversary, the time gacha games give back to the community for sticking with them for so long. And they do what? Spit in our faces, have a crappy anniversary banner. Nothing to do and nothing to look forward to as of 2.1, wait another year before you start the game. Maybe it‚Äôll be more full.",1
I‚Äôm what you would consider a whale in this game (almost 2k spent) and I have decided I won‚Äôt be spending anymore. The developers have made too many decisions that are just distasteful. They released too many characters that have been tested and demonstrated to have flaws in their kit - but devs refuse to make buffs. The story arc for the third part of Inazuma was extremely rushed and I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the war scenario. The anniversary rewards are the worst part. They reward their players for playing for the past year with rewards that are the same as a previous event - so they‚Äôre not even special. The game is great - but with the developers heading in this direction I don‚Äôt really want to support them anymore.,1
"After playing for an entire year, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd be able to get decent artifacts, but the system is so skewed against players that the only stats and substats you get are DEF and HP. Either implement a pity system for that or allow me to convert my stats somehow, because it‚Äôs so disappointing to not get a single good artifact after two months of farming domains. I understand this system exists to make me want to pull for new characters, but it‚Äôs disheartening and makes me want to quit. 
Also, the anniversary rewards could be more generous, and would make me feel more appreciated as a player who‚Äôs been around since the beginning. It‚Äôs just seems like MiHoYo is just another greedy and selfish company lately.",1
"I‚Äôve mostly been playing on playstion, I just got back on mobile. Graphic still the same, but this game is so entertaining that I don‚Äôt even care about the graphics. The lore is complete, the characters are beautiful, voice actors = MWAH, some bosses maybe hard but that‚Äôs what makes genshin an IMPACT. ( Hah- see what I did right there? A pun. ) but I love the work sm! You developers, creators, well the whole community is just so BEAUTIFUL. I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt seem to make any sense. Although this is just a beautiful game.",5
"Hello!  Overall the game is good but it takes up WAY too much space.  I had to delete many things too download it but it still didn‚Äôt    Work.  I‚Äôm very disappointed about this and wish that it had not a lot of space.  I‚Äôve been seeing it all over tiktok and I‚Äôve been really wanting to download it but I can‚Äôt.  

From what I‚Äôve seen the game is very good and you guys did an excellent job on this game.  The characters are so good and the graphics are perfect.  

This is a very good game.  I wish you well goodbye now!",4
"GENSHIN impact really is a good game but the amount of times that I have crashed is annoying. I would sometimes crash midwish and that resulted with a wasted ten pull and nothing in return. Basically I wasted 1600 primo gems for nothing. Another pesky problem is that during boss fights my game would suddenly kick me out and causing me to rejoin the battle, making me restart the whole boss fight. Inazuma is fun but it has been my game so laggy and so bad it makes me loose the motivation to keep playing. I‚Äôm pretty sure some ppl can agree with this but I just wanted to share my experience of how annoying it is.",3
"The game is absolutely amazing! The graphics and quality are great too, but there is something that bothers me. (Well two but whatever) 1, when aether of lumine loses his or her twin we never know when were gonna find them again and no one ever helps you except missing person posters. And 2, when ever I go onto my home screen for a second it takes forever to load back on. idk ifs its my phone or the game but over all its amazing!",5
"This game is awesome!! It has cool characters, a decent storyline, great gameplay and awesome soundtrack. But I do have some nitpicks. It takes up WAY too much space. It takes almost 10 gigabytes!! That‚Äôs crazy!! Secondly, I THINK it takes too much internet as when the cutscenes of some worlds start, it just stammers and is really stuttery. Other than that, it is definitely a great game to play on mobile platforms. I didn‚Äôt know that this was a console game before. So great job MiHoYo!!",5
"This game is amazing but I just wish it didn‚Äôt have so much glitches and i wish it wasn‚Äôt so stressful, I was on the part where venti opened the wind wall barrier and I died while tryna do the quest cause I didn‚Äôt have food and it spawned me outside of the barrier and now I can‚Äôt get back it anymore and I‚Äôm just stuck there now i don‚Äôt know what to do, overall this game is great I recommend it but I really wish you could fix the glitches and I‚Äôm really stressed out because I can‚Äôt get through the wall anymore and I can‚Äôt finish the quest until I do and it‚Äôs impossible to get through",3
I really love this game! Especially with the events that come out I especially loved this latest one with the ping pong type mini game. I‚Äôm free to play and don‚Äôt have a huge problem with the hatch‚Äôs aspect. Of course I‚Äôm jealous of people who are able to spend tons of money but I have a great team and have gotten all the characters that I‚Äôve wanted I just have to strategically save. Nonetheless I would love to continue to see events like the Island adventure one that just took place!,5
"This game is quite good and it is fun to explore but once you‚Äôve explored everything all you have left is to grind stuff and wait for events and new content, also it would be nice to know if the developers have any plans to balance the new areas (once they are added) to prevent the older players from just breezing through the story due to how powerful they are and to prevent to new areas from being to hard for the players that aren‚Äôt as insanely over powered",5
I love this game. The graphics are amazing and the controls are great. This reminds me so much of Zelda breath of the Wild. I‚Äôm highly impressed. Usually if graphics are good on a game you have to buy it and since this is free (with purchases if you want) I am so glad a family member of mine recommended this game to me. I‚Äôve only been playing for a few days but I‚Äôm already addicted. I feel like if I‚Äôd spend money in here (I might) it would not go to waste. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 10/5 stars.,5
"I love the game. I play this game so many times for hours. But one of the most frustrating things in this game is pulling the same four-star character when I have finished all of their constellations and that I don't need them anymore. This means I wasted some of my wishes on something I don't need anymore. Could you guy fix that, please üôè? I'm hoping no one has gone through the same pain and anger as me. ( ;_;) I wish I can have my waisted wishes back.",5
So I‚Äôve been playing this game for a while it was a great experience when I started and all the way through but one day I logged on and i was not logged in on my account and for some reason was not able to get back in and I forgot the information for that account even the email which is my fault but still I should not have been kicked out of my own account in the first place and I lost all my data I have been trying to get it back but again no info just wish that the game didn‚Äôt log me out for absolutely no reason at all!,3
"Ok so I really enjoy this game because I played the BOTW story so many times. Only issue is tho on my phone (iPhone 8) the game is laggy and my phone overheats like crazy more than any other graphically demanding game I‚Äôve played, almost like touching the inside of an oven. This happens within 30 seconds of just opening the game and I gets so uncomfortable that I have to just close the game. This game is definitely better suited for newer hardware. I feel bad for people with metal frames tho as metal conducts heat. Anyway if the developer could fix this or improve on it then I‚Äôll give it 5 stars.",4
"To start off, this game has amazing features and things and it‚Äôs really beautiful and the characters are so detailed and different personalities and stories. There‚Äôs also elements for each character that is really epic. This game is really challenging where u can wish for characters do events kill monsters! That‚Äôs the best part I recommend this game 100% another thing is you can play with other people / add and chat with them like that‚Äôs so sick if you‚Äôre reading this please play genshin impact a great game!",5
"PLEASE GIVE ME JEAN PLZ I LOVE HER NOW GIVE HER TO ME NOW. GIVE ME VENTI TOO. THIS IS HOMOPHOBIC. Anyways this is genuinely a good game but it‚Äôs really hard to find some quests but overall it‚Äôs awesome! I spend a lot of time playing and it‚Äôs super interesting. When I met Venti I was like: üò±üò±üò±üò± and honestly I‚Äôm in love with Jean. The character we start out with is adorable to!! (I chose the boy and named him Fallon btw) and his sister seems to be really important to him! Keep up the awesome work! And give me jean. Now. Oh another thing, KAEYA IM GOING TO KILL YOU IF YOU SEND ME ON ANOTHER FALSE MISSION IM GOING TO HIT YOU GREE BARK BARK WOOF!!!!",5
"It‚Äôs an amazing game from the gameplay to the music. But for mobile users, it gets a bit hard to move at times so I would suggest making an option in the settings for either a static or dynamic control. Like wherever my thumb on the left side of the screen is that‚Äôs where the move control goes. That would make this the best mobile game ever in my opinion. Even though at the moment I can‚Äôt even think of a better game haha.",5
"I been playing this game since the release and the graphics, events, story line etc are so beautiful. It‚Äôs my first non-mmorg ever and I play it everyday.  The bad thing is it takes so much storage and I can‚Äôt play dragon raja but oh well. In my opinion, Genshin impact eats up dragon raja. The devs in dragon raja don‚Äôt update barely or the game feels like a job. I love both but I choose Genshin over dragon raja any day. If u compare the two games, dragon raja has more cons but Genshin has more pros. The Gacha is ok but it‚Äôs fun even it has PVE.

P.S I recommend this game so much and u will love it too",5
"Yes yes!  This game is so incredible!  I did not play Honkai, but I know that you are the best developer out there!!  The story is so incredible, the characters are simply amazing, I love it all!
Here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôm hoping for!
Another chibi.
Dendro characters!! (If Baizhu never comes out I‚Äôm gonna cry ;w;)
Lore on the random out of bounds house!
A ‚Äúcursed‚Äù character that takes the fore of an animal (like a fox)
Claymore Hydro 4*
Kaeya‚Äôs idle being cool
Skins after max ascension phase
Some revamped descriptions (who did sharpshooter‚Äôs oath?? Just-)
More character stories~
Slime Champ achievements
New types of characters
Blistering heat (sumeru)
A five star I have a chance to roll for :v
Childe rerun
Klee rerun
Amber‚Äôs birthday mail sending a pocket explosion
More characters have what‚Äôs going on with xiao and noelle (element for opposite city)
Snezhnaya‚Äôs sheer cold going up FASTER unless you have a character from Snezhnaya",5
"When I first downloaded this game I had no CLUE what I was in for. It blew me away. The graphics, the fact that i can‚Äôt recall any ads and the fact that i have never really been a fan of games like this on mobile (typically because they have way to many ads) although there is one thing, I wish it was easier to get characters. The better characters you get the better you play. It‚Äôs super hard to get good characters because you need to pay for it. That‚Äôs my only flaw with this game.",5
"I love this game because of its graphics, story, and characters. The story is very incising, and wants you to play more! But sometimes the app crashes which is annoying but my save still saves my progress which is nice! And for the cut scenes, I‚Äôve found a way to actually play them. So you go out of the app for a second and go back in and it plays the cut scene like normal and then keep doing that every about 5 seconds. I know it‚Äôs repetitive but at least you can hear and see the story clearly. :D",5
"So I really love this game with beautiful graphics and vivid visual impressions. The characters design are very fashionable in an open world fantasy adventure setting. However, the anime video keep frozen, and it is all black out in Storm dragon mission for me as the background are black, I only can hear the sound. I play this on an IPad with the most updated version. This means I can‚Äôt play through the mission. So does any one know what is going on with the issue on Storm Dragon mission? Please fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you.",4
"When I first downloaded it, it always crashed and I never got to the actual game. I reinstalled it when I saw it was updated and bugs were fixed. There was an improvement, I got to finally play but the first cutscene was ruined by intense lag. I have an iPhone 7, so maybe having an older generation phone is the reason why it lags so terribly.. it could be my fault and I probably have to invest in a newer phone like an iPhone 12. I really really want to enjoy and play this game, sadly I cannot. I hope you can give me an explanation or some advice, or continue to improve and fix this wonderful game.",3
I was enjoying this game until I had to defeat Stormterror. I stocked up on characters and food for 3 days just to get killed by him because of a game glitch. During the glitch he killed all of my people. Mind you I was on the last round of killing him. I‚Äôve never wanted to delete an app so bad. This was very upsetting. I‚Äôve also heard that others have problems with Stormterror due to the graphics and how the game was made. I‚Äôm very disappointed I was actually enjoying this game. Now I can‚Äôt enjoy it because my people keep dying  and because of the game glitching. I‚Äôve took screenshots of the glitch. I will try to add them.,2
"This is game is one of the best free games I‚Äôve ever played. I‚Äôm at Adventure Rank 35 and I still haven‚Äôt seen the entire map lol. One only problem is that the game only gives the players 120 resins, and the good bosses cost 40 resins to get the rewards. Meaning I can only fight 3 bosses per day, which makes this game long to upgrade characters and weapons.
However, it has a great variety of characters that you can get for free if you are lucky. And they are all fun to play with. Great job!!!",5
"Genshin Impact is a play on the cliche missing family trope but at the same time, a masterfully executed game that leaves the player wanting more. Though the primogem and character pull system are extremely rigged, players can easily level up to 15 with out much bastle. This game is such a joy to play through that you don‚Äôt notice the hours spent and the in game progression feels organic. Haven‚Äôt seen a bug yet and I haven‚Äôt had much trouble from 1-12 levels. Definitely recommend giving Genshin Impact a try.",5
"This game should be a flagship game for a phone release. It‚Äôs the beauty that I‚Äôve been waiting for. It‚Äôs so aesthetically pleasing, I love just looking at the environments from a tall point. The open world is huge big and seamless. The only thing I wish it had was customizable clothing, equips that change your appearance. The weapons already do that though. Super excited to see what‚Äôs in store for this game and us players. Congratulations miHoYo on an amazing launch and an amazing game!",5
I went in this knowing it was like BOTW but it‚Äôs so much more ü§© I was surprised how they put so many different Elements together and it‚Äôs not Sloppy. I‚Äôve played for a few hours now and I am already addicted to it. My little secret is I play on PS4 and the only reason is the iPhone and iPad don‚Äôt support game pads yet. Hope they put that on here because I‚Äôd play more on phone this game is a ‚ÄúExtreme Go‚Äù you won‚Äôt be disappointed because it is what you want to do after First 10-20 mins will My Lovely Gaming Community I hope you enjoy as much as I am,5
"If you have enough storage you can get it. It takes a long time to load everything to your mobile device, but is a 10/10. I would recommend this game if you want adventure and combat. You can collect characters and complete quests. I love this game so much and I try to play it everyday in hope of getting the people I want. I hope that one day I can look back, after I have finished it, and remember how fun it was.",5
"As a mobile player, this game IS SO BAD. this is probably only a problem for a few people BUT STILL, I will list some things that got me quitting this horrible game. First, the loading! It takes so long and I understand it‚Äôs a large and popular game but it took me 1 hour to just download the game AND when they update the game it took me about 40-50 minutes. LIKE OMG! Also, I couldn‚Äôt continue the Wangshu quest because I was in the exact spot but IT WOULDNT LET ME CONTINUE THE QUEST! I couldn‚Äôt continue the archon quest meaning I would not be able to beat the game to Inazuma. These are just a few reasons I need fixed, but the rest are so little I won‚Äôt complain about them. GENSHIN PLEASE FIX THIS >:(",1
"Please raise the resin cap I keep a timer on my phone for every time 160 minutes goes by and I can do a domain. My life no longer goes by hours and days it goes by 160 minute and 1280 minute increments. (If you did not know that‚Äôs the amount for 20 resin and 160 resin to spawn) I get very little sleep as I wake up every 160 minutes to do another domain‚Ä¶ or ley line. I must go, as it‚Äôs been 158 minutes since my last domain. (Btw I‚Äôm kidding about all of this but PLEASE RAISE THE RESIN CAP)",5
I love the game it‚Äôs like hopping into a whole nother world and I‚Äôve become obsessed with this game I also love Kokomi she‚Äôs such a beauty and I love her personality but the reasons I really like this game is the beautiful islands in Inazuma I love Watatsumi Island! I also love the Character designs their beautiful in every way! the only problem is that this game takes up a lot of storage for me and yes if you are wondering I am a mobile player and it just takes up way too much storage for me!,5
"I played it only a little once I first got the game because I didn‚Äôt understand it at first, however even though I was one of the first to get the game when it came out because it looked cool when I saw it in the AppStore on a coincidence my friend also got the game and showed me what I was doing wrong. I soon was having a lot of fun and it even saved me when I was stressed about schooling and helped me to relax. I love this game and I love it‚Äôs lore!",5
I love this game it‚Äôs so pretty and great. But there are a few things they need to fix for me to ever play this again. First this game is so f‚Äôing big I couldn‚Äôt do anything else on my phone or computer. second they over s‚Ç¨xualized their female characters. Third they don‚Äôt have many of color characters. They have 3 but they aren‚Äôt really even of color they‚Äôre just a tanned white (I‚Äôm white and I‚Äôm darker then them) but other then that the games great after they fix those things then I‚Äôll start playing again.,4
Look I play this game everyday and I love it it is the only game in a while that I only play for on day and just forget about it but when it comes for me to like put in codes it gives me such a hard time when I go into settings and click Account I only have two buttons but none of which are a redeem codes button which I know that pc players get but what about mobile it is just to confusing and I have tried to update this game so many times I am really getting annoyed,4
"How I figured out about Genshin was of a youtuber, named Fundy!
I downloaded Genshin as a very funny ‚ÄúAnime Game‚Äù, after a year of non-stop playing, Genshin Impact has become my favorite game! It is fun, challenging and addicting. I may have whaled a few times but, that‚Äôs because Genshin is the most fun game I‚Äôve ever played. 

    I recommend Genshin to everyone who enjoys combat game play, and gacha games! I also want to say that, it‚Äôs so fun and it‚Äôs interesting because most gacha games are 2D while Genshin is a very fun open world game.",5
I would‚Äôve loved to have gotten the chance to play this game. However that hasn‚Äôt been the case. I was excited to download and play this game. Seeing as it has great reviews. I kept getting the error 1009 I think message saying not enough space to download data. No matter what I did I still kept receiving this message. I did some researching to find out that I‚Äôm not the only one who has encountered this issue with the game. So I hope that sometime in the near future the issue will be resolved and I can finally enjoy this game. I look forward to playing it in the near future. Definitely will replace this review as soon as the issue is fixed. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,1
"I think that it‚Äôs a very successful game and is very fun. Although, it seems like the content is becoming better and the files are very big. It‚Äôs not like they can really fix that without ruining the game, but I also think the characters are getting way too powerful, to the part where some of the characters are more powerful than the archons themselves. I also look forward to more content so that the people who finished the story can enjoy things too. I think it is still a good game though.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing since day one. I‚Äôm so in love with the story, exploration, and characters. The updates to this game NEVER disappoint. If you finish the main story quests before the next update, there‚Äôs always something else to do. The events are super fun and engaging. It‚Äôs also really easy to receive the in-game currency to spend on the gacha which makes it nice for F2P. This game is definitely worth investing time in.

Much love and appreciation to the devs for continuing to improve the game.",5
"It‚Äôs insane how much space it takes on your phone, might as well get rid of the mobile version and focus on the console one if you‚Äôre really trying to make a big interactive game, the mobile version is just too big. I currently have 6 games on my iPhone and when I tried getting genshin I had to delete 4/6 and it still tells me I have no space, those games were dead by daylight, Apex legends, codm, mobile legends, plus 2 more, how s it that genshin is a bigger game than all of those games combined????? How? Apex and codm are huge games but this one is just ridiculously big for no absolute reason. Wish it was smaller because I was planning to spend a good while on it.",1
"The game is incredible at first. Sadly, the more you play the more the cracks start to show. There is so much potential for this game, but instead of building upon the core gameplay of combat, character collection, resource refinement, and exploration, throw away events get cycled every few weeks. On top of that, lore that was revealed in past events is simply missing from the game, requiring you to research outside the game if you want to understand who certain characters are. Players‚Äô feedback is ignored, and the gacha system is the stingiest out of any that I have seen. It really feels like Hoyoverse doesn‚Äôt care about its playerbase in the slightest. Fine for casual play, but disappointing beyond that.",1
"Genshin Impact is, in my opinion, the most entertaining, funny, and beautiful game I've ever played! There are a bunch of quests and areas for you to explore and so many characters to get. The world of Teyvat has many regions for you to discover. The character design is amazing! From the outfits to their animations, all wonderful. The only thing I don't love about Genshin Impact is the wishing system. But it is a gacha game, so I'm not too upset about it. I bet you'll like it too, so give it a try!",5
This game is good and I would prefer that you would download it but I am on mobile and whenever I try to join it at first it was perfectly fine then I joined it and it was good but then the second time it was good too but then around the fifth time it started getting glitchy and it took longer to load but by a bunch of times that I logged in it didn‚Äôt let me it kept signing me out even though I was logging in so and even though I deleted it and got it back it still did the same thing so I can‚Äôt really give it a five star but it‚Äôs still a good game,3
"To be honest, I only got Genshin Impact because of my friend. She told me ‚ÄúHey, you should download Genshin Impact.‚Äù And there I did. But this isn‚Äôt about me, this is about Genshin Impact. First of all, I love it, and I think many of you do too. Second of all, it is kinda bad, cause you do have to do lots of stuff just to get one thing, only one. Lasty, it‚Äôs just perfection. I love the game, and I recommend you download it, and I‚Äôll let you know, it takes a long time to finish downloading. Have a good day.",5
"I have been apart of Genshin since the release of the 1.6 version, and i have loved it. However, with recent updates i have seen such a lack in diversity of skin tones and ethnicity. The only TWO characters out of the around 40 others that have tan skin are more than stereotyped. With a new region coming out that's meant to represent the middle east (where people of darker skin tones reside), it's so incredibly disappointing to see Mihoyo ONCE AGAIN not showing any respect for those other cultures and disrespecting the nation by not representing its people. After 2.8, if this issue is not resolved by the characters presumed release in 3.0+ i hate to say that i will not be continuing to play Genshin impact. Thank you.",1
When I first started playing the story line was great and worth it but why does it take so much storage? Also when I opened the app my volume was all the way up and I was not able to hear any of the sound it‚Äôs a rlly good game I just can‚Äôt hear anything and as a new player it‚Äôs rlly hard to navigate where you can buy new characters and stuff I do wanna have my sound back in genshin please tell me how to fix it thanks! Anyway ABout the game it‚Äôs fun but when I did the first story I don‚Äôt know how to do the next chapter idk if I wait 24 hours or not so yeah that‚Äôs it,3
Amazing game but there‚Äôs one problem I have been having for being on mobile for so long. I would try to move but my screen would shake and it would always open random things like map or anything or even the elemental sight when I don‚Äôt press it and when i try to fight it opens map randomly when I don‚Äôt press it can you please maybe fix this? I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the only one who experienced this but I‚Äôd be happy if it would stop coming and going.,4
I love this game like I really do. I love the characters and the story and genuinely it is a fun game. The problem that I am having though is storage space‚Ä¶ especially since now it takes up 20 GB that I don‚Äôt even  have anymore. With this 2.7 update I probably won‚Äôt be able to play due to the fact of the update. I wish this game could come out on switch so I could play it without worrying about my phone storage.,5
So my internet is ‚Äúpoor‚Äù so I can‚Äôt get in but my sister plays so I‚Äôm sure she can help me. But from me watching her it‚Äôs very cool and amazing! She let me play a couple of minutes on there and the Quality is perfect! The character designers did a wonderful job! And Thoma is my husband. He is so generous I love how all characters have there own personality. You all did great on this game but I give 4 star is because it won‚Äôt work but I‚Äôm sure my sister can help. But until I fully play for myself we will see.,4
"This is most definitely my favorite game at the moment. ( ignore the 1* reviews they are mostly people asking for a 5* or bulling. And no, I won‚Äôt ‚Äúsnap back to reality and get a girlfriend‚Äù. I am not doing that because Genshin can be an escape from the garbage world we live in. ) anyways, the story‚Äôs are awesome, character design and voices are incredible, the Gacha part can be free to play, the starters are pretty good, and The VISUALS. THE FREAKING VISUALS ARE INCREDIBLE. So, over all, I definitely recommend this game. Give it a shot sometime!",5
"It‚Äôs hard to get a 5 star character you want from their own exclusive banner. It takes forever to get enough in-game currency you can naturally get over time without paying for it. It takes months of saving to get the 5 star you want if you have bad luck. 

When you finally get a 5 star character you wanted, you want to main the character no matter the flaws or the popular opinion. But it‚Äôs hard to enjoy a character unconditionally when the developers pretends to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a character and claim it‚Äôs an optimized change, but makes the character worst. 

I wasn‚Äôt angry about the anniversary drama, but I‚Äôm really angry at the developer thoughtlessly changing Yae Miko, who was barely 3 weeks out from initial banner release, and NERFING A 5-STAR CHARACTER!!! The ‚Äúfixed‚Äù even made her C2 constellation worthless!!!! 

I‚Äôm a patient and understanding Genshin player, but I can‚Äôt believe they would claim this is obvious nerf an optimized ‚Äúfix‚Äù. Worst, they immediately announced they won‚Äôt reverse the change at all!!!!",1
"I‚Äôve been playing mobile games since 2010, I‚Äôve played most of them and spent quite a bit of money. This is with out a doubt the best one I‚Äôve played, you can enjoy it for free or you can spend. You can play it for hours,  it reminds me of the final fantasy 
Series which I loved. I‚Äôm really happy that I found it. I like the no pvp aspect of it. There‚Äôs no tension about beating someone else.
If you like the original final fantasy series this game is for you‚Ä¶..",5
"I loved the game it‚Äôs so fun my sister has it on her phone iPad and computer and when we go to my taekwondo place she used to bring her phone their so she can play and now she has most of the 5 star characters and their are so many 4 star characters and 5 star characters and there still making more so this game is so awesome and has so many elements like fire,water,ice,electric,geo and last earth wich their still making so this is the best game to play when you‚Äôre bored.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I love this game, I really really do and I play it on both ps4 and mobile, but the only problem is see is the resin, 160 resin is just too little, specially that it takes 20 resins at least to play anything and it doesn‚Äôt give you descent stuff, we got plenty of characters but we can‚Äôt build them and level them up it costs a lot and the resin doesn‚Äôt allow it, so if you could just give us more resin or maybe lower the recharge time (8 mins for 1 resin is way too much) so plz‚Ä¶ more resin. 

other than this the game is epic",4
Ive had this game for a full year now and this game is amazing when ever Im bored or just have nothing to play. The graphics are amazing they completely mesmerized me and I love the story the only things that do bother is that fact that it takes up a lot of phone storage and that it takes forever to level up. But other than that this game is perfect for me and my sisters literally enjoy watching me rage then get all happy when I figure something outüòÖüòÅ,5
"Genshin Impact is actually an addictive game. It is fun to play, and also very much inspired from another game, Breath of the Wild. As amazing as BOTW is, I felt like Genshin was a lot easier to get into for me. The visuals are excellent and the art style is gorgeous. The characters have great looks and detailed outfits and character designs. They are fun to play as and to check out their different abilities, gameplay, voice lines, and personality. Story impressed with deep seated meaning and is very enjoyable. This is still the best thing China has ever done in years, and a great apology for COVID-19.",4
"Been playing since the launch of the game and have been playing ever since, I have took a decent break and have missed some of the events and important story in the events as well, I‚Äôve been loving the archon quests as well along side with the open world and characters as well, I know as well that some people are upset over the anniversary rewards, I‚Äôm personally happy with them and wanna say thank you for your hard work on this masterpiece. Thank You miHoYo!!!!",5
"The game is fun don‚Äôt get me wrong. It blends open world very well with aspects like stat progression and combat mechanics. But the game leaves a lot to be desired unless you‚Äôre someone who likes to grind a lot, be ready for a lot of grinding. Because once you reach the higher levels it only gets harder to level up your characters via finding materials. And yes the game may be free but that‚Äôs only because you‚Äôll have to pay money if you wish to progress even faster and I‚Äôll tell you now, it takes forever to make progress. The game‚Äôs only pro‚Äôs are its world and character design, it‚Äôs story and lore (which has a lot of fluff) and combat mechanics.",2
"i‚Äôve been playing this game for a year now and registered my account on my uncle‚Äôs ps4, i have since switched to playing on my ipad because i moved out of my grandmas house and so did my uncle. I tried purchasing genesis crystals on here and i was unable to, because i have to purchase crystals on the device i registered with, but i don‚Äôt have access to that device because it‚Äôs not mine. See my issue? And there is no more information on this issue except for the pop-up message saying ‚Äúplease top-up your account on the device you registered with.‚Äù",3
"I loved BOTW and I love Genshin.. they both feel very similar and unique in ways. The combat is incredible, the story, dialogue, characters are beautifully crafted and it‚Äôs really an immersive experience. AND it‚Äôs free to play, WHAT??!.. to think there are so many crybabies in the playerbase groaning about rewards?? You‚Äôre literally entitled to nothing, go outside and get some fresh air. This is a great game, I‚Äôve probably invested 40-50 hours into it and still have so much to do, I highly recommend. 10/10",5
"As someone who has played this game since launch, I can say with certainty that this game has not changed much since launch. A few events here and there people really just put up with for the sake of getting primogems needed for rolling characters the want. Then it‚Äôs nothing but farming for items to maximize the new character‚Äôs damage or utility. It‚Äôs been this way since launch, and there are no signs of this changing. Do yourself a favor and find a more worthwhile game to get into until these lazy devs decide to finally do something different. Story mode is an absolute slog to get through.",3
"The game, It‚Äôs a great game I‚Äôve played it once before, but now I‚Äôve gotten a new phone and it‚Äôs not letting me back on? ‚ÄòPoor quality of the network‚Äô is all that shows up, and don‚Äôt tell me my network is probably poor because my network is fine. It‚Äôs something wrong with the game. I‚Äôve tried making multiple new accounts but it still doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôd like some advice on how to get back on, because I really enjoyed this game, and I would like to play it again. So if you‚Äôd please assist me on getting back into the game I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Thank you.",3
"Hey, they have done a great job with game. Even though I‚Äôve joined since the Eula banner, I have absolutely loved the story line and treasure hunting. Right now, I am currently co-oping, carrying and helping other people with their worlds. 
Yeah some times it‚Äôs frustrating getting the same swords on wishes, but whatever, that‚Äôs not the reason why I‚Äôve joined Genshin Impact, it‚Äôs the community. Reason why I‚Äôm still playing every day is because people are so cool! 
So get on Genshin, make some new friends!",5
"At first it was a bit slow but once you really engage and get into the game and the story it‚Äôs really good. The play style is amazing, characters amazing, story amazing. The npcs even have their own stories, personalities, etc. You can tell this game was made with so much effort, thought, and love. The promotions are great too. You really can play for free fully if you grind it‚Äôs a great game. Try it out, it might take you a month to actually play like me lol but I now play it a lot.",5
I love everything about this game. However when I‚Äôm roaming around and see dogs and cats just sitting there it always makes me wish I can take them with me! The dogs follow you a bit which I love but I‚Äôd rather be able to have a small companion. I‚Äôd be completely fine if they didn‚Äôt do anything either. I‚Äôd simply want them to have them. Same with petting the stray animals because why not. All in all love the game,5
"This game was absolutely wonderful when I started playing it. The world building was fantastic, the graphics were phenomenal, and the gameplay was fair. However, I cannot turn a blind eye to the increased mistreatment of the player base. Between nonsensical chat filters, unjustified bans, and flat out corporate greed, this game has devolved from an enjoyable gacha to a sad  cash-grab in recent months. Recently released characters feel incomplete, content feels rushed, and the developers have become increasingly stingy on what services are provided for free-to-play players. As much as I used to enjoy this game, it has been ruined by poor decision making in management and I cannot possibly give it a good review.",1
"after putting in 1000~ hours and 55ars the games gotten a little stale. mihoyo is INCREDIBLY GREEDY AND SELFISH about giving out rewards in genshin impact. honkai has way better rewards. players need to spend weeks grinding consistently to hit the required level caps for new content with minimal rewards and it‚Äôs becoming hard for new players to get into the game because of this. the new content isn‚Äôt that fun or interesting either, rewards are very minimal and the company is AWFUL about communicating with the community. leakers do more for the community than the pr/media team does.",3
"1. The first star I put is for ho what‚Äôs the game is. The Gacha maechanics are really hard to even get a 5*. The timing challenges are hard and sucky bc one quest, (trails in tianqu) is disabling co op for me. Also the air asencion is the hardest part. The second star I put was because the game is offensive-to me. When paimon says to baizhu that he is wearing MEDICINE INGREDIENTS which in my opinion snakes should never be used to HELP humans as we-humans are very evil and I despise them. And lastly the animal cruelty. Killing innocent creatures-including monsters just to live. And stealing bird eggs!? That I really hate about this game. I‚Äôm likely to never really play it for now on. I would prefer a fix about the Gachas and the animal mechanics.",2
"Beautiful graphic and character designs, I love the game play. Been playing it for a year now, every month there‚Äôs new event, new character released, not much games can do that now days. And my favorite part is that this game doesn‚Äôt force multiplayer events, which is the best! Because i like solo play, you don‚Äôt have to compete with anyone. You play at your own pace. And the event is easy to complete, doesn‚Äôt require you to grind a lot.",5
"Im not saying that the game itself is dumb im saying that its dumb that you cant play it on iPod touch. I love this game so much I play it on the PS4 whenever my dad lets me, but when i first wanted to play it we first tried it on my iPod but i barely got past choosing the twin. i deleted it an we had to make me a PSN account because yall r jerks and made it so it doesnt work on iPods.
it shouldnt even be on iPod touch app stores if we cant play it!!!! FIX before i get more mad than i already am!!!! I MEAN IT EVEN SAYS THAT ITS COMPATIBLE WITH IPOD TOUCH!!!!!!!!!! LIARS",5
"genshin is amazing, ive been playing for around 4-5 months and i absolutely love it. reading the title of this review must be weird as it has could be better in the title, i mean that as the only time it gets boring is when 1. you run out of quests and 2. theres not enough ways to make primogems fast. and I know that this makes the game a challenge but i would love more primogem giving quests and more quests in general. overall amazing game i do reccomend",5
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever played a mobile game this gorgeous. What‚Äôs even better is that you don‚Äôt necessarily have to rely on the in app purchases to get by in the game (not that it isn‚Äôt tempting üòâ). I like that it‚Äôs so close to BotW without it feeling monotonous. I even went out and got a controller compatible with my 12 Pro Max just so I could play more comfortably..! I pretty much haven‚Äôt put it down since I downloaded it . Now to figure out how to cast gameplay onto a smart TV‚Ä¶ ü§î,5
"Hello! I wanna say that I love this game and it‚Äôs supper fun, it‚Äôs addicting, awesome, and the music is beyond amazing. The characters are beautiful. I have one thing I did want to say, when I was playing the game I‚Äôm on lvl 25, but my lvl won‚Äôt go up and I can‚Äôt lvl up to 26 and it‚Äôs staying like this for 6 days. Don‚Äôt know how to really explain this but, my xp is now on 1,000 and something and is above the xp for lvl 26 and I can‚Äôt do the quests that for lvl 26, pls fix this :(. But overall great game üòäüëçüèΩ",5
Thousands of accounts are being hacked on Genshin Imapct. f2p and p2p players alike are at a huge risk of being hacked. f2p players spend hours and hours grinding primogems and doing gachas for 5 stars and p2p players are spending large amounts of money for a 5*. Don't you see how hard people work on this game? Don't you realize the weight of this problem? You guys are crazy for telling people to stop leaking 1.5 content but then have the AUDACITY to stay silent about not adding 2fa because you guys made billions of dollars in 6 months. I don't care is 1.5 is a filler update as long as it was 2fa. This is ridiculous.,4
"This game is fun but in 3 more things to make it better. 1st thing more customization for you character like a town just for customization examples- hair and clothes. 2nd a tournament or battle arena so you can face other real world players. 3rd more spells for your character like scrolls for new magic abilities or a way to combine magic attacks for a new one. Genshin impact is great but I can be better. I can‚Äôt wait to see a new update. 

P.s you should add some mini bosses into the game.",5
"My friend recommended me this game and I was skeptical at first because I thought it was going to be one of those boot-leg sword online games but turns out it wasn‚Äôt that. In fact it was more than that, this game had me playing for hours. You always have something new to do and it may seem confusing at first but once you get the hang of it you understand better. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes fantasy games.",5
"I love this game because, there is so much to do! You will never get bored of this game. There is books, scrolls, missions, etc. the graphics of this game are also phenomenal. This is a long term game. So people who like and adventure, get this game! Not to mention the ads, they only show what happens in the game and don‚Äôt scam people. They don‚Äôt make ads that say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt reach pink color‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt beat level 23‚Äù so that is why I just love this game. So people who get this game, good luck and adventure on!",5
"Really impressive and immersive game. This is console game on my iPhone/iPad. It has it all, it‚Äôs basically Zelda game, but more JRPG take, with its own take, good voice acting, interesting combat mechanic with multiple characters and different stacking abilities.

The reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars is the lack of controller support. When in battle I find myself fumbling with my fingers, wanting to move,  change characters and use different attacks at the same time. I feel the game would shine with ps4 ( or any other) controller.

Would love to see this added, would definitely make this game a no-brainer.",4
I haven‚Äôt gotten into mobile games in a minute because I always felt they were lack luster but 10/10 for Genshin. It‚Äôs free but there‚Äôs so much to do and I like an open world that‚Äôs really open world. The only think I wash was different was the cut scenes. My iPad can‚Äôt handle it and they freeze their way through and I can never understand what‚Äôs going on over the stuttering. I wish we could read what happened or lower the quality for those specifically and not the whole game.,5
"Hey love the game but co-op seem to bland besides bosses or a few dungeons it is not much left to do.
also can you make it so in co-op we both get the chest just our own rewards like most co-op games have done over the last 10 years.
Because sometimes it seem point less after we do everything thing and the open world is all that is left to explore but it is like a waste because you don‚Äôt get any rewards that count really.
Also can I see my map in a players world that don‚Äôt have the whole map unlocked.
Just those few things will make the game co-op more fun.",4
"The combat is great but the game needs more character customization. They should at least allow us to choose the weapon for the main character, especially if they expect us to be stuck with them the whole game. Also why are there so many sword wielding male characters? Give us some variety. I‚Äôd like to see more support, bow, focus, and Polearm male characters. I love strong female characters but I like to imagine myself in the games I play. 

Also, any game with a gacha system as the only way to obtain certain characters is predatory. Why can‚Äôt we just buy the characters we want? I guess because they wouldn‚Äôt be able to scam us out of money :(

P.s. I know she has a lot of fans but for some of us Paimon is unbearably annoying. Sorry!! ü•∫",1
"I can play the game normally even though my iPad is not compatible but I crash too often every 10-20 minutes I do some thing I crash, when I teleport and there is a lot to load I crash, when I play too fast, and when I play the game too long when I‚Äôm in monstatdt and I tap 2 thing I crash when I‚Äôm in Liyue and I tap a lot i crash and it takes me about 5 minutes to load the game but overall it‚Äôs very good, good graphics, good gameplay design, but please fix the resin.",5
"After years of playing games and being really disappointed in them I found one that is really enjoyable. I‚Äôve been a PC gamer my whole life and this game reminds me of old RPG games, the differences being better mechanics, graphics and actual voice acting! on a mobile platform! I‚Äôm only a few hours into the game and it‚Äôs honestly a lot of fun I would suggest it to anyone and from what I‚Äôve seen the world is huge. I plan to update this review biased on future updates and game play!",5
"I don‚Äôt typically take the time to review these games but I‚Äôm in love with this one! Though, for how long I‚Äôm not sure. This is a gem in the mobile gaming world and I recommend it to anyone, pre-ordering got you a lot of perks so that‚Äôs nice but you must take the time to appreciate the characters as well. They are well-designed and have fun stories and traits as well. I think the process for obtaining them is actually very fair and I doubt I will have to use money for it since you can trade in-game credits for characters and objects. I‚Äôm liking this game so far.",4
"Have an absolute blast with the game so far. I‚Äôm still early on in my journey and have been really enjoying playing it on my phone. I‚Äôd absolutely love to see controller support added to mobile devices. I‚Äôd enhance my playing experience GREATLY, and I‚Äôd love to have that option. The touch controls are setup really well, but I‚Äôve never been a fan of them in general. I imagine controller support will come shortly since it‚Äôs on consoles and PC with the support. But I‚Äôd would be tremendous to see sooner than later!",5
"Ever since this game was announced back a while ago, I‚Äôve been waiting for it to come out. Now that it‚Äôs finally out and I‚Äôve played it for a couple days, the least I can say is it is amazing! The story plot is incredibly written, the fighting mechanics are balanced, and the open world is beautiful! The only things I think they could‚Äôve done better is the voice acting, but even that was above average. Overall this is probably the best open world game I‚Äôve played on mobile, and I have played a lot of them.",5
"This seems like an awesome game. But, here‚Äôs why I uninstalled it: I really don‚Äôt like that the movement control (touch analog style) is bound to a single tiny area which you can‚Äôt enlarge (there is no option). I was constantly moving in a direction that I didn‚Äôt intend to. Super frustrating. The best option would be a control area that follows wherever you place your thumb like in COD or PUBG. Also, the camera doesn‚Äôt follow your character when you turn. So, you have to constantly adjust your view to see where you‚Äôre going. The combination of the two issues gave me a headache and I stopped playing. Maybe I‚Äôll check back later to see if the developers have fixed the problem.",1
"Edit: Time limit in quest should also be removed or be made optional to be turned on off for anyone who like a challenge. Not everyone want to be rushed in videogame. I play to relax not to punish myself.

I am very annoyed by the number of ‚Äúgliding‚Äù mini games this game required for story progression. Not every player good at it, this should be made entirely optional for player to progress. I play game for fun not to be annoyed by every two minutes of faliling down.

Overall a good game , I will be happy to pay for the characters and stuff if all the annoying minigame -and time limit is made entirely optional.",3
"I've downloaded and promptly un-installed many games from the App Store. I'm always looking for something that catches my interest and keeps me wanting to come back for more. This game is beautiful, and very well thought out. The voice acting is great and I find myself actually watching cut scenes and paying attention to dialogue. Do yourself a favor and download this game. I was so immersed in the game play that I completely forgot I was playing on my phone. This would definitely be a $60 game on the Switch.",5
"This is hands down the best gacha game I have ever played, if not one of the best games period.

It‚Äôs Breath of the Wild with cute anime boys and girls, and way more things to do. I also feel like they were inspired by Xenoblade Chronicles with how the town and time system works. It‚Äôs astoundingly high quality.

But. The devs were not kidding when they said iphone 8 or higher. I have an iphone 6 and the game has huge fps issues, but that‚Äôs not their fault. I will instead be switching to PC and just collecting daily rewards with my phone for now.",5
"I gave only four stars because there is no controller support. I feel like a game as beautiful and vast as this deserves controller support to feel the full experience. Please add controller support. If controller support is added this game could potential be one of the best mobile games of this decade behind Call of Duty Mobile Fortnite and Among Us.  In fact from the looks of it, it already is. Just please add controller support. Lol 

Anyway congrats on all your hard work.  This game is a true work of art. It reminds me of Zelda, Tales of Vesperis and Ni no Kuni. Keep up the good work.

P.S. Don‚Äôt forget controller support update. Lol ü§™üôèüèæüôåüèæ",4
"I am loving this game im so into it, there soo much to do i love it. But it keeps crashing jere and there and the quest take a while to load up and its not my connection and the game is slow to load the maps completely sometimes but the rest is good hope i can get more elements then 2 soon. I also have a suggestion to the character why not instead of having to go to a statue to change element u can use more than one element to do combos and such. Statues can be used to equip the element yes but it would be great to use more than one",5
"I‚Äôve been a huge fan of the company that made the game especially the Honkai Impact 3rd. The graphics are amazing and the story is interesting. The only downside is that my phone gets burning hot where the camera lenses are. And it starts getting that way just after opening the app while not even in the game. And because of this the game lags and is really hard to enjoy.

I do hope that this issue will be fixed soon or even if it‚Äôs possible. Apart from the overheating of my phone the game is outstanding.",5
"This isn‚Äôt my first time playing Genshin Impact, and when I did it, I was in a really far level my name was never quit with a capital N but one day it randomly vanished. My account was gone and when I tried to put my email in it it didn‚Äôt work and now a couple months later I got it to work but it started me at the very beginning of the game but I don‚Äôt care I just want to let you guys know just in case it happens again  it‚Äôs fun playing again from the beginning just a little.",4
"I enjoy playing the game and playing it with some other friends who recommended it to me I get on almost daily to play and enjoy the graphics, character designs, wishing for other characters, and playing and annoying friends its a great game and very enjoyable to play with friends and enjoy the graphics the way each region is also based of on real life places also makes it an amazing and interesting game to explore and play.",5
I really love this game it is so fascinating watching how strong you can become over just a little bit of time and your power is very clear. The only thing that i wish that Genshin had was a guild system. Having a guild system to join other people and compete against other guilds as a test of strength would be amazing. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be guild system just would like something along the lines of a guild system.,5
"I started genshin impact a while ago, and I‚Äôve played since. It‚Äôs constantly updated and releasing new characters often so there‚Äôs tons of content to do and lots of story, gameplay, and scenery. Genshin is a fun and interesting game, but it takes a ton of storage and all the content to do is intimidating to new players. I find it worth having despite the storage issue, but I guess that‚Äôs up to each player to decide. Despite it being kind of intimidating to start, I think it‚Äôs worth it.",4
"I cant express how much i love this game. It‚Äôs the first game which I‚Äôve played that has so much lore!! It‚Äôs such an interesting journey and there is a lot of effort put into it. The fandom is one of the biggest i have seen, i love talking and relating on characters we both like. It a whole community!! I‚Äôm sure im never gonna leave until the entire story is finished and the game is complete. When you step in, there‚Äôs no going back lol I‚Äôve already planned my next few years.",5
"Genshin impact is a really good game. It has stunning graphics and runs well on mobile devices. The good: good graphics, good story, optimized for mobile devices, fun gameplay.
The bad: some objects don‚Äôt have collision, you can clip into walls. Characters clip into cliffs they are climbing, climbing can be quite buggy. The game is extremely p2w and you need insane luck to even stand a chance late game. There is almost no enemy variety, it‚Äôs just slimes and hilichurls.

Overall Genshin is a good game, it just has lots of bugs that need to be fixed. A three star rating will have to suffice.",3
"I admit, Genshin pulls you in with its colorful charm, open world, and interesting story. As much as I would love to give the game 5 stars, it doesn‚Äôt deserve that. The game starts out rather easy, but as time goes on, it gets harder and harder to level up without spending exorbitant amounts of money. Don‚Äôt. Being free-to-play is a painful option, but it‚Äôs worth it. The game is fun, but don‚Äôt give unreasonable amounts of money to the game for no reason. I don‚Äôt mind supporting, but the sheer amount of money it may take for one character is pain. (Looking at you, 50/50 at 90 pity getting Diluc)",3
I love genshin and am quite willing to continue playing it but as a person of color myself it‚Äôs hard to watch them pop out characters based off areas of the world that have more darker tones and completely white wash them I don‚Äôt think hoyoverse is racist but is very much in the dark on what skin tones of these cultures they are putting into there game so all I ask hoyoverse is to make more than 1 or 2 darker skin tones characters but spread out the agenda and just have a better representation in your game.,4
it‚Äôs really fun and i like the characters and such. i think someone mentioned that it takes up a lot of storage for mobile players and it does. the app description says 3gb but it actually takes up around 20gb. it‚Äôs worth it honestly. i do wish it was easier to get 5* characters but something has to be difficult or there would be no point. i‚Äôm also glad they have more reruns now because i missed a lot of character banners like kazuha and yae miko and ayaka that i really like. besides getting 4* characters is good too. the main storyline is fun too and i love the story quests and hangout events. i‚Äôm also glad you can get some characters like barbara and xiangling for free throughout the game. i love this game and the world is so detailed and the music is amazing :)) i will definitely keep playing!,5
"I want to give it a 2 and a half but idk how to do that, I would love to give it more but it doesn‚Äôt deserve that. It was a great game that is until I got to inazuma, it was all smooth. There is the quest that you have to do to be able to get the rest of the island, and So I‚Äôm doing I‚Äôve Done it like 70 times and I finally get it finished, or so I thought. I‚Äôve killed the last guy and got the achievement before the very last second but then it tells me I‚Äôve failed. If I don‚Äôt finish the quest I can‚Äôt go in coop mode so there is no point in playing if I can‚Äôt do anything.",3
"W o w. This game blows me away. I‚Äôve played so many similar games but none like this. None have the amount of attention paid to things such as this one. Side quests, crafting, gathering, cooking, so much. You don‚Äôt need to spend for this, gacha is a nice bonus but not necessary to get through the game or feel like you‚Äôre missing out on something others have. Trust me on this one. It‚Äôs a beautiful and unique experience you have to play.",5
"(I APOLOGIZE IF I HURT ANY OTHER GAME‚ÄôS REPUTATION. YOU PROBABLY HAVE GOOD GAMES I AM SURE. BUT I PERSONNALY LIKE GENSHIN . IDID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE OR PUT ANY OFFENSE) 

SO, GENSHIN IMPACT. Travel Teyvat and explore new regions. Collect new companions to join your journey. Fight enemies with Characters with different elements and weapons. Get exp to level up you Adventure Rank (AR) to get cool rewards. Level up your characters, weapons and artifacts to get stronger. Best part? FREEMOGEMS! (Free primogems) Jk. Don‚Äôt take my advice! Play to see if it‚Äôs good for you! Anyways, Thank you Hoyoverse for making the best game ever! üòÅ",5
"The past few years I have been exited for the different events and characters, even though I am not good at the game I still enjoy playing it a lot and before I was always bored and had nothing to do but Genshin flipped it around so when I was bored I could play Genshin and finally do my commissions that I usually never do c: And also please give the gave a 10/10 that would be awesome and more people could play the game and so on. HAVE A GREAT DAY GUYS AND BYE!.",5
"I overall love this game. Ive been playing for at least a year now and I‚Äôm still not bored of it. The graphics are amazing. I also like the little details in this game, it‚Äôs makes it fun. I also love the storylines and a lot of the events, as well as characters and the gameplay. I do hope hoyoverse adds more variety to the skin tones of the characters though. It would be really cool to have darker skin characters since most of them are light skinned.",5
"I really like this game and I feel like it has no inappropriate concepts and not that much addiction. There also isn‚Äôt much in game purchases which is a lot better. It does start off very complicated and it‚Äôs pretty confusing if you don‚Äôt really know what you are doing. Additionally, the app will randomly log me out and delete some of my quest progress which get really annoying but it may just be my device. Overall tho, it‚Äôs a super fun app",5
"The developers should be very proud of the game they made. It‚Äôs amazing! Of course in my opinion it is. They did a lot of animation and coding! Also, you can make your own characters too! I play this game on my iPad 24/7 when I have time of course. Also the monsters and or villains are very unique. To be honest,it‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve ever played! I also l loved when‚Äîoops, maybe not,I don‚Äôt want to spoil it for new players. But all I‚Äôll say is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a really good game!",5
"ive been playing for about 5-6 months and i can honestly say this game is great. the character designs is just wow, and theres hundreds of things to do. i play about 3-5 times a week (mainly to do commissions) and its wow. just about every character has a story and you can interact w basically every character. plus you get a surprise on ur bday, woo!! my only complaint is that its hard to get to ar 16, and its kinda un-fun if you arent playing with friends no? anyways, thats all.",5
"I honestly have enjoyed playing this game for the past 5 months and its great. Although there are a few problems here and there they dont ruin the game. One thing that makes this game bad in my opinion is the players, some complain about things they dont like despite knowing that it‚Äôs completely immature, such as leaving a bad review about they dont have enough storage to play this game, or even, they hate the gacha system of a GACHA game. In conclusion, keep up the great work Hoyoverse!",5
"I started playing April 2021, and have been addicted ever since. The plot is great, characters are fun to play and so pretty and graphics are amazing.
The one notable thing I think could use fixing is the wishing/pity system. Perhaps the pity should be lowered for players that are f2p, so it‚Äôs easier for them to get characters. It should also be easier to earn wishes.
Overall, it‚Äôs a great game, and I‚Äôm very excited for the other areas on the map to be unlocked. :) Thank you, Hoyoverse!",5
"First off, I dislike how Genshin takes up a large amount of storage. I‚Äôve deleted many apps for Genshin and it said I didn‚Äôt have enough storage. 

Second, regarding the gacha system and primogems. I strongly agree that on the event weapon banner there should be a 50/50 like the character event banner. You would be spending large amounts of money or primogems for a weapon that might not be the one you desire for. 

Third, when I try to play Genshin it starts to crash. I don‚Äôt get why it does this. I spent over an hour setting up Genshin just for it to crash and not let me play. (Keep in mind I play Genshin on different devices)",2
"I absolutely love Genshin. The graphics are amazing, the game play is perfect, and the new events really make this game fun and interesting. The only problem is, I haven‚Äôt been able to play this game for over a year. I‚Äôve tried deleting and re-downloading, but nothing works. I‚Äôve tried resetting my password and it still keeps saying ‚ÄúPoor Quality of Network‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt matter where I try to log in from, it ALWAYS does that. I would really love to continue playing it, but I can‚Äôt if it won‚Äôt even let me log in.",4
"My only wish was that there WAS a subscription. I‚Äôm not really into gatcha gambling and micro transactions but this game is basically free to play, no ads, and incredibly designed with great voice acting, gorgeous graphics, and a great story line (minus some necessary weirdness when you have a character in your party that you are supposed to do talk to‚Ä¶)
I want to give you money to support your amazing efforts but what you have to offer is nothing I‚Äôm interested in!",5
"I love Genshin impact so much, it‚Äôs so fun too. I feel like everyone in the world should know and play this game. They put there heart into the game and boom! This game happened. I love the characters, Klee, lumine,venti, there are to many to characters that are amazing. To be honest, all of them are so cute,amazing, well designed. It‚Äôs amazing. Amazing work on Genshin, if I was a teacher, and the company was my student, and the company‚Äôs test was this, I would give it a big fat ‚ÄúA++++++++++++++++++++++‚Äù",5
"This game is super good!I love how you get to adventure around this world and unlock new places. The storyline is beautiful, and the characters are very detailed! When I got this game, I didn‚Äôt expect it to be so full of life and excitement! The events, and challenges you can do are so cool! The characters clothes are super unique! The battle scenes are so cool, they always get me excited for what is coming up ahead. Before, I never knew what games to play but this one is just beautiful! Great job mihoyo!",5
"don‚Äôt get me wrong, this game is well designed and it looks beautiful but it gets repetitive. it is fun when you start playing it but it gets boring so quick, it‚Äôs all the same thing. the story is weak and boring. in the story quests you don‚Äôt do much, it‚Äôs just a bunch of reading and talking. it also has unfair prices and isn‚Äôt free to play friendly. to get one guaranteed 5 star, you have to pay over $100 (not worth it). it is also possible to get characters without spending money but as you play the game for longer, it gets less and less generous. they don‚Äôt treat long term players very well and barely give them any primogems. also after you finish all the quests there‚Äôs not many things to do besides things like domains and daily commissions. overall it‚Äôs a well designed game and it did have me reeled in for a while but the more and more i played it and the higher of an adventure rank i got, it lost me.",3
"I played it since during our pandemic. I fell in love with guest and the fighting techniques! Is so amazing seeing characters as well. I do want to say that I stopped because I was busy with work and school. But I got back and I been better at this game. The stories are so amazing and I do want to say as well is that the characters are so good. They look amazing the 3D is good nothing less ab it. This reminded me of SAO game where u play on phone. If you ever consider thinking, definitely try it out!üíØ",5
"I got this game back in April and fell in love with it very quickly! The graphics are amazing and the attention to detail is astronomical! The characters and enemies are diverse and unique and give a fun challenge! There are so many things to do like treasure hunting, boss fighting , map exploration. The diversity between the areas of the map are beautiful and you can find some breathtaking places to view. I am excited for what is to come and for more of the map and story to be unlocked!",5
"i never used to download games because i was never ever happy with any of them. other games usually have so many bugs or are just pointless. genshin has amazing graphics, amazing VA‚Äôs, and an actual plot. not to mention, almost every character has a background story. this game has fun missions, and even a fun open world. i recently downloaded this game and cannot stop playing, this is the type of game i would ruin my sleep schedule for.",5
"Genshin Impact is really fun to play with my friends and waste time, heck even if it wasn‚Äôt to waste time, it‚Äôs pretty fun, but I‚Äôve had problems every now and then. 

At one point, I hadn‚Äôt used the app in a while, and I thought it would be fine, no, it wasn‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt even let me in the game, and I had to close out of the app more then 3 times, uninstall it, reinstall it, close the app and back in another 5 times, and then add the extra quality and everything. 
So, yes it is pretty fun, but if you play on a laggy computer or on mobile, remember to play it at least once a week to check in on it. 

Overall, pretty fun, and the gameplay, story, and adventure is so pretty, I just wish there was something to do with the flowers, like sell them, make a flower crown out of them, or something.",5
"The game is very good itself, the character designs, lore, daily commission etc. But the people who run the game obviously don‚Äôt care about the fans. I had hopes for the first anniversary, I mean even just a 10 pull would‚Äôve been fine. But from what I‚Äôve heard we aren‚Äôt getting anything except from the theater thing which is one wish. It‚Äôs truly disappointing that they actually did this. I thought it was a joke. I mean giving out 100 primos for people who are making art, music and I even saw someone making a genshin sword out of real metal. It‚Äôs literally not even 1$. Plus it only goes to 1000 people. If you play the game you‚Äôd know that 100 primos isn‚Äôt even enough for ONE WISH. I mean cmon do better.",1
"I think this might be my first written review and all I can say it GET ITT!! I have been playing for almost a year and I tend to get bored of games after a few months! I have been addicted to this game ever since I got it! Sure there are some times where you might get bored but it never stops because there‚Äôs always something new to do!! I get people might hesitate, so all I can is just give it a try!! After all it won‚Äôt cost you to simply try!! Have fun!!",5
Ok so I‚Äôve been playing for around 2 months now and in the first month I had zero problems at all but all of a sudden when I play the game it randomly just closes out on me and goes straight to my Home Screen. The tabs still kept open but I have to wait to load back into the game. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my phone or not or it might be a bug. I've restarted my phone and reinstalled it many times but nothing seem to work. I just wanna enjoy the game without any interruptions üò≠,4
"Hi if you want to play a really fun game definitely get this one! If you don‚Äôt want to spend money make sure you have patients! This is a beautiful game and you will feel apart of the world in an instant. This game also supports the LGBTQ community but having same sex relationships, I find this to be a great thing that should be added in more games! You can‚Äôt immediately Play online, and must reach level 16 b4 you can! I hope this helps and have a fun time playing!!",5
"This is a really fun game! I‚Äôve been playing it for some weeks and it‚Äôs the type of game I like to play, but the problem that I‚Äôm having is whenever I go to mail or just sometimes walk around it keeps kicking me out. And it‚Äôs even worse when I‚Äôm on a voice call with someone, I don‚Äôt really know if pc players have a problem with this but I play on mobile and it‚Äôs really annoying when I keep getting kicked out. But other then that I hope you fix it and the game is really good otherwise!",4
"All of my friends have been talking about Genshin Impact. They seemed to love it and were obsess with this game. They told me it was a fantasy game, and they know I love fantasies. I tried out the game and it was outstanding. The quests are interesting to do and you'll never get bored of doing them! You're able to play with friends and chat with them, also! I think the creators of this game put lots of effort in it, the graphics are beyond this world. I highly recommend this game!",5
"Enemies such as the ‚ÄúPrimo Geovishap‚Äù, ‚Äúfrostarm lawachurl‚Äù, ‚Äúruin hunter‚Äù, ‚Äúruin grader‚Äù, and ‚Äúlegionnaire cryogunner‚Äù have been glitching since update 1.4 

Those select enemies oddly retreat back to spawn and regain their health if the player is fighting slightly farther away from the enemies spawn but still in the enemies attack range.

I have tested each enemies attack range myself and I have concluded that the health regeneration glitch is definitely a glitch. I ask that you increase the range of which a enemy can fight in its domain because defeating the  Frostarm lawachurl at the top of dragon spines is the only way to complete the quest.",4
"This game is incredible, it‚Äôs become my new favorite thing. I make sure to do it before everything. It‚Äôs so relaxing and the design and graphics are insanely beautiful. There is so much effort that goes into this game and you can tell. If your looking for a good game to download get this game :D. The music is relaxing and the characters are insanely thought out. There is so much that goes into this game and I love it. This game is amazing and you should 100% download it if you are thinking about it.",5
"I think the game is amazing, graphics, storyline, details, it‚Äôs all good and the fact that it‚Äôs completely FREE! But only 2 problems, my game randomly crashes and it‚Äôs so hard to get wishes, there should be a way to get primogems easier but obviously with a difficult challenge. It takes me around 2 days to get 1 intertwined wish which is very frustrating when it comes to really wanting someone. Overall I really enjoy this game, thanks for making it!",5
"Ghenshin your game is!but ,the ice quest called investigate  the strange ice,after you deafest ,you will have to defeat three monster and there called ruin guards,you have to draft three of them but,isn‚Äôt that a little bit to much,I mean people passed it,but threee ruin guard is too much,you should put like one ,because there still a beginner,and newbie,so I think that you should not have that much ruin guards in the quest,but overall this game is amazing!!keep working on it,make it better,alsoo the graphics or good,and this game is amazing,I‚Äôm speechless,but anyways this game is great and I‚Äôm not sending hate",3
"This is an amazing open world game that has tons of things to do, tons of characters to obtain and make strong using items obtained by bosses, graphics are AMAZING this is a pc game that runs flawlessly on mobile cant recommend this game enough also its FREE TO PLAY you CAN pay for in game currency to make wishes and get epic characters & weapons but you can also obtain the in game paid currency for free by playing during events and completing quests this game is amazing and there is so much to come in future updates you should hop in NOW!!!",5
"So overall the story is good and the game is pretty nice, there‚Äôs just a few problems I‚Äôve been experiencing. At first when you teleport to a statue and then walk around the world gets all blurry and you would be half way under ground. The next problem is when I click the Genshin Impact game it‚Äôs automatically logs me out and it keeps on glitching, I tried many ways to get rid of it but it kept on logging me out. So I would be very grateful if you could fix those two problems!",4
"OK, genshin is one of the most fun and addicting games I have ever played. The character designed and graphics are out of this world and the updates keep getting better. The only issue I have with the game is that once you accept a quest it will not let you cancel the quest. I am stuck in a predicament where I have to finish a quest before I can start another one. I can not complete it for my life and really want to complete the rest of the quest for the lantern rite events but can‚Äôt because of this. I really hope the creators will consider adding a remove quest button.",4
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong its good and I love this game!, but it keeps crashing on me. Say for example i‚Äôm in the middle of a battle and then the game will just randomly exit it‚Äôs self. I‚Äôm not sure if its my phone or the graphics are to strong for my phone. I have a 7 (old i know), and it says ‚Äúworks on this device.‚Äù but it just keeps crashing on me. I don‚Äôt know if everyone with a phone below the 8 is having this problem or its just me, but yeah this is my little rant hope I can get the game working soon so I can enjoy the game more. but yeah great game again and bye!~üå∏üíñ",4
This is not a pay to play game. This reminds me heavily of Zelda breath of the wild. This is only in regards to the way that the open world is laid out in the way you can glide around. All in all this game is definitelyA masterful piece of artwork on its own and does expand way past Zelda breath of the wild and becomes it‚Äôs own amazing open world RPG. By far this is the best game on the app market these days for open world and free to play. You can sing hundreds of hours into this game. The developers did and amazing job!,5
"I should probably start by saying I am not a fan of gacha mechanic in video games. That being said I still enjoy this game very much. If your an anime fan and love RPGS then you can‚Äôt go wrong with this game. Theres tons to do and you don‚Äôt have to spend money to enjoy playing. My review is solely  based on the mobile version. I think on pc or console there are better games, however the game is free, which is hard to beat. Would recommend giving it a try. If you don‚Äôt enjoy it then the only thing ya lost was time.",5
"I just started this game last week and I adore it, though I really do wish there were more... mundane? Parts of it? Housing, gardening, maybe even pets? These features, while an obviously minor part of the game, would help me to feel more like an actual part of the world instead of just a bystander. I think it would also help to give more of a break and lessen the feeing of grinding the entire time. Also, character customization options would be lovely, even if it‚Äôs just changing hair or eye color.",5
"This game plays like how all AA games should play. Smooth performance, beautiful sceneries, fantastic combat/party elements. 

The issues I do have are as follows:

1. Lack of meaningful co-op quests, adventures and gameplay. The one event that just came out, the Elemental Crucible, was buggy and laggy most of the time. I guess this could be due to the server overload. It gets lonely and boring running stuff by yourself all the time. 

2. Lack of Resin - The resin gets spent so fast that you find yourself running around in other people‚Äôs world stealing their materials just to spend quality time together.

3. Clunky artifact equipment 
system - no mechanism to lock the artifacts that you want to keep. When combining weapons or artifacts, no info interface to tell you what you‚Äôre combining. And I don‚Äôt know..just feels clunky. 

4. Stamina could be improved upon a bit, or give us a mount...

5. Could be a little less grindy.",4
"I love this game! Although me and my friends get frustrated when we play together, and only ONE person gets the rewards. (That persons world) and it is super unfair. Please make it so we can get rewards too! And the fact we can‚Äôt get statue waypoint‚Äôs makes things worse. If I fight a boss with my friends and we need to heal, we find a nearby statue that we haven‚Äôt claimed yet. But we cannot heal, forcing us to teleport away and travel back again. Please fix this! I know I‚Äôm not the only person that is mad about this in Co Op Mode! üôè",4
"Definitely recommend taking the time to reroll for a 5*.  Took me 12 rerolls over the course of a few days but I got one and it will make the overall adventure more fun.  I am a dolphin level player typically and will whale in games I really enjoy.  However, this one needs to take some tips from games like AFK Arena in how to reward its player base.  I haven‚Äôt seen a game this stingy with currency in a LONG time.  Pretty sure the person in charge of gamification over there hasn‚Äôt taken a look at findings and improvements in the field in a few years.  As it stands I‚Äôll be a small dolphin at best.  They boost their player rewards and I‚Äôd be happy to respond in kind!",2
"I love love love this game it has an amazing story and graphics, I have a brother that plays ps4 and I play mobile we both play this game non stop, cross play is fun and works well however there‚Äôs not much to do together which was a bit disappointing. The gameplay is very smooth and appealing my only complaint for this game is it does take a long time to travel when you don‚Äôt have the landmarks found, it would be amazing if you added mounts or animals you could tame. But overall this is an amazing game!",5
"I knew something wasn‚Äôt right before the game even began the opening cutscene was completely messed up. It would only show one frame but the characters would still talk but audio was severely distorted this also happened in the later cutscene when you load into the game but this is where the real problem lies. The world is like a massive void completely black except for small patches around the player and at random times a massive flare will just appear on the main character. Due to all of this I couldn‚Äôt even complete the tutorial. The game sounds and looks amazing but it‚Äôs completely broken for me so until it‚Äôs fixed or receive a way to fix it myself I can‚Äôt play it, simply because it‚Äôs unplayable.",1
"Honestly, I started on ps4 to see what the game was like, and honestly, I think this is my favorite game to date, hands down, I can spend hours just running across the map doing quests and things like that. Also, the game is super free to play friendly, you can beat almost every quest in the game with what he game gives you, and what you can‚Äôt, they make for in being able to summon because of the fates they give you. Best game on the App Store for me, 11/10 would recommend if you haven‚Äôt already.",5
"This game is awesome. Combat is smooth and the world looks so big and detailed. My only big issue with this game are the cutscenes. Cutscenes with action sequences like the intro and the dragon scene lag and I have no clue what is happening. As a game that is driven by story, it‚Äôs hard to appreciate the game. I have an iPhone 7 Plus and the settings were set on the lowest. Suprisingly. The gacha system is unobtrusive and doesn‚Äôt force people to pay for this game. I wish this game supported iPhone 7 Plus because the of issues related to cutscenes, loading, and lag.",5
"Genshin is one of my favorite games. This graphics and gameplay are super immersive, and the soundtrack is actually awe inspiring. Each character really feels different from each other. The game gets a lot of hate but I don‚Äôt get why. People often say that it‚Äôs just a Breath of the Wild knockoff which doesn‚Äôt track as the games are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. While it does have flaws, every game does. Couldn‚Äôt recommend enough.",5
"The graphics are beautiful, the story is immersive and overall it‚Äôs just a really fun game. I‚Äôve played for almost 90 days I don‚Äôt have much of an issue. My only problem is that as someone who doesn‚Äôt like to spend much money on games is that it‚Äôs hard to advance without spending money, however I understand this is a company and they need to make money so I really don‚Äôt mind much. But overall this is great game I‚Äôd recommend to everyone.",5
"So i was super exited when downloaded the game. The graphics and character designs are amazing. But the thing is you have to download the rest of the game and i don't have enough storage to do that so, i finished it in a day, and really want to do the rest of the game. But i cant. Its really tightening my chest. To know that a game i jumped out of my seat for. Wont even let me finish it. So can you pls fix this. Let everyone get a chance at the hole game. Not just the people who are dumb enough to delete everything for one app.",4
It‚Äôs a great game the characters are good everything I just wish it was easier to get characters I keep losing the 50/50 to 4 star characters or nothing but everything else is good would recommend to get it and I‚Äôm glad they put scaramouche out but it‚Äôs so hard to get him I lost my 50/50 twice so I wish it was easier to get him and can we please have more days on is banner so I could earn more money to spend on primos anyways that‚Äôs it.,5
"i live genshin bc it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me stain rn . But there are a few tiny flaws with it . One is the pulling system , it‚Äôs randomized which is good but sometimes it‚Äôs unfair for players‚Ä¶  two money , a lot of money or a lot of hours just to get you favorite character(s) . Thread there is a lag and some much storage taken up in your device. but nonetheless they are still a very fun community to join and all the others that i‚Äôve met were so nice !",5
"This game is amazing. The graphics, voice actors, soundtrack, and character designs are astounding. I have no complaints. To those who say, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not enough content,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, ‚Äúyou would if you touched grass.‚Äù

I understand touching grass is hard, but if I can run 6 miles, you can walk 6 feet outside and touch grass.

Jokes aside, there‚Äôs plenty of content for starting players, and updates are coming about every month so your bound to have something to do.",5
"Hi! I‚Äôm not as done with Genshin and I still need to finish some parts but I noticed something a lot of Genshin fans were angry about‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about the representation. Despite the game being about cultures and religion. Their is only 2 POC(People of color). Kaeya and Xinyan. Both who are stereotyped to be a bad person. Kaeya- an alcoholic, and Xinyan- an annoying person. While other games had not hesitated to add people of Hijabis, POC, and disabled people. You can do better Hoyoverse",5
"I would have given this game 5 stars, if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it would take me about a month to get a 10 pull. I joined about 3 weeks ago and it was an overall good game, but now I would suggest  giving more primogems in the daily commissions, maybe 150 primos or less per commission (to make the game more f2p friendly). And make the game require less storage space. My 6th gen iPad (yea it‚Äôs old) keeps crashing 3-5 times when I‚Äôm playing

Love, a randomgamergurl",4
I first played this game on September 28th of 2020 on PS4 this game kept me entertained and safe during the Corona Virus Pandemic my PS4 now overheats when I play this game and turns off without no warning it is overheating. I played on my mobile phone it is good but I missed my PS4 account I miss my 5 star Waifus and Husbandos. The movement and combat controls on Mobile it suks it is dog crap I wanted to attack an enemy but I accidentally tap jumped button because of my fat fingers. Anyways still good keep doing well HoyoLAB. -Franky,5
"One of the most amazing games I‚Äôve ever played. I am 100% faithful to this game. Playing this game is the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning, and the last thing I do before I go to sleep. I can‚Äôt get enough. I‚Äôm still learning tips, and tricks everyday to help guide me along this awesome world of escape from everyday life. I‚Äôll keep adventuring until I can‚Äôt anymore. Please I highly recommend to all choose your character and join this adventure, create the perfect team for you, follow the path you believe in! GOOD LUCK TRAVELERS!!!",4
"While the game is fun and has so much potential, the representation of POC is horrible. We only have 2 POC characters realized, Xinyan and Kaeya. With the making  of Sumaru I had high hopes genshin would redeem itself considering Sumaru is based off of the Middle East. But clearly they couldn‚Äôt, most of the characters are very pale and the ones who aren‚Äôt (only 3 of them) are still very very light. Candace is a huge example that Hoyoverse only likes to tailor to their white male audience. For those who don‚Äôt know, Candace is based off of a historical queen who was very very dark skinned but with the realize of Candace she is very very very pale compared to the original historical figure. I deeply hope Hoyoverse fixes this problem",1
"Listen, I love this game. I‚Äôve spent money to support something I like, but as a POC it‚Äôs getting harder to do that. This game takes inspiration from actual cultures/traditions from certain regions. It excels in portraying those cultures amazing except for character design. There‚Äôs only TWO tan characters and that‚Äôs the most they‚Äôll go. TAN. When you use other cultures to make a profit from it‚Äôs only reasonable that you‚Äôll pay respect to the people from said region. And making them all neon white is not it. This company is appealing to a worldwide audience not just China. It‚Äôs time Hoyoverse steps up and does something about this because it‚Äôs getting tiring seeing a game i love head in this direction again.",1
"I really love the game but the lack of dark skin characters and good rep for poc people is astonishing, every character is paper white and it‚Äôs just really weird how none of the characters are at least a little tan even though most of them are outside in the sun all of time.. yesterday I went on a boat ride and i‚Äôm in my house all the time so I used to look like a ghost but I was only out there for a few hours and now I‚Äôm super tan. please make more of your characters darker because not everybody is white like that‚Ä¶.",4
"I started playing this game a few months ago and I am addicted. 
There‚Äôs so much to it! So many quests, cool characters, weapons, artifacts etc. overall I just love this game so much! I still haven‚Äôt gotten bored and still have thing to do in the a game despite playing for multiple months! This game saved me from boredom and I really love it! Something I think would be cool though is if you could trade characters or Consolations! But overall I am in love with this game!",5
"I do like this game a lot but there are many issues. There‚Äôs a lack of end game content for when you‚Äôve finished all of the quests in an update, making it difficult to stay invested outside of events. There are also only 2 characters with darker skin and one is a stereotype. I was hopeful with the announcement of a Middle Eastern Region that they would add more diversity to the game, but all of the NPC‚Äôs from the region are extremely pale and the characters we know are going to be in the region are also pale. It‚Äôs disgusting that the company would put so much investment into properly representing other regions, but not a region with darker skinned people.",1
"I adore the character designs but sadly im extremely disappointed with the so called representation you present, there is absolutely not enough darker skinned representation in this game. When there is a dark skinned character in this game they are presented with horrid stereotypes and seen as scary, loud, or things of that sort. Usually the dark skinned characters you design are shown as rough, not approachable, nor kind, and seen as angry and mean. Listen to your fans and do the right thing for we have been giving you guys many opportunities and chances to do so. Considering a new region coming out that involves many diverse cultures and ethnicities I suggest you do your research before you lose majority of your fanbase.",1
"This game i sooo fun and so addictive, one of my most favorite games, keep up the good work. But it takes a lot of data and storage. I encouraged my sister to download this game but when she downloaded it it was taking so much storage she waited hours for enough storage she deleted 10+ apps and games to have enough storage. So what I‚Äôm trying to say here is if you could find a way to make this game take less storage I think we‚Äôd all appreciate it and more people would download this game. - Charli Nash Coulon <3",4
"I totally recommend Genshin!! Just one thing. In the beginning when I first started playing with my cousin, we couldn‚Äôt get our eyes off of it!!!But then that went down hill, and we didn‚Äôt play for months. It‚Äôs one of those games where u play and then you just give up. Then u have to convince yourself to start again. But that might just be me!! It‚Äôs an amazing game overall, and I love the graphics and all of the work you guys put into it. PLAY GENSHIN!!üòÉüòÉüòÉ",5
They pulling system is honestly kinda bad..for people that do 1 pulls it‚Äôs kinda unfair to them that just cause they don‚Äôt get a lot of primos cause they also don‚Äôt spend moneys it‚Äôs kinda unfair that they don‚Äôt get a lot of good characters. I think you should have more events with primos that come in the players mail because honestly not a lot of people spend money so it‚Äôs kinda rude to have a pulling system to be like not really giving them good characters. So please fix the pulling system and the primogems.,4
I have rlly bad gacha luck but it's super fun I love it smells can't wait for sumeru as well it's a bit laggy on mobile so playing on ps is easily imo it seems pretty wholesome and cute but not rlly also thank you for the primo gems an also why are people mad about the genshin fandom huh also stop blaming mihoyo for the stupid pro shippers blame their moms for giving birthüòç anyways I got good stuff recently thank u mihoyo for the 6 new 5 star artifacts :) thanks for working through the shanghai lockdown as well that was rlly bad :( <3,5
"I really do. It‚Äôs beautiful, the music is amazing, the quests are interesting and the community is thriving with nice people. I love getting new characters and just plain exploring sometimes. Sometimes the dialogue is boring, but the game itself I could never get tired of. After a long day at school, I love to just pull out my phone and run around beating up the slime monsters, or collecting fruits and making food. I really love this game, and I recommend you play it :]",5
"downloaded as a ‚Äúim bored lets see what it does‚Äù kind of game, and wow im addicted. im drawing characters, thinking about this game constantly, and have spent a little bit of my own money on it (although i do prefer the free to play grind a bit more) the 5* rates could use some work, they feel very low, esp as someone who works very hard for primogems (in game wish currency). i wish i could see my favorite characters idling where you‚Äôd expect them to be- kaeya in the cats tail or angels share diluc in angels share or dawn winery zhongli around liyue harbor childe around golden house outside of your weekly battle jean in her office lisa in the library xiao at the inn. theres so much to do in this game, ive been playing for months and i still feel like i have so much to do. 

always a pleasure to hop on and play!",5
Altogether this game is great with the graphics and story plot but I have some issues but it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm playing on iPhone 7 if you‚Äôre playing on an iPhone 7 or lower you‚Äôre gonna have lag because it‚Äôs recommended for iPhone 8 and up but altogether the game is really good and great and I suggest you give it a try if you‚Äôre reading this and You haven‚Äôt played it You should play it it‚Äôs a really great game and if you don‚Äôt play it you‚Äôre weird,5
"I play Genshin on my phone and it crashes very often so if you have a better device I suggest you play on that for better experiences :> I love to draw and Genshin‚Äôs graphics and designs are just STUNNING!! This game however requires a lot of time, for their lore or building a character, etc; but for a student like me who gets buried by hw everyday it still serves a great position for me to release stressŸ©( ·êõ )Ÿà Overall really recommend this game hope this helped :>",5
"Genshin is a really fun and personally, comforting. There is so much to do and you never really run out of things to do. The characters are really pretty and the designs are really good. It‚Äôs also a good time-spender, if you need to waste some time then just play this game! I don‚Äôt recommend speed tuning so take your time with this game. (the new in-game anniversary rewards are fine btw! There‚Äôs more rewards coming (it‚Äôs currently 1/4 as of writing this!) so i do recommend genshin impact",5
"The reason why im rating this 1 star is because the company is so greedy, the fandom is very much toxic, the company doesnt even consider the reviews we leave under the posts mihoyo does on twitter so they could actually make their game better. The reason why i left the fandom & the game is for that exact reason, the company is greedy. the anniversary rewards are literally trash. we only get 10 intertwined fates for 1 year, plus how you gonna let your own fandom & community get more toxic then you already are? very much disrespectful to my point of view. maybe you would have a better community, better playstyle, & earnings if you would actually listen to everyone around you. üò®üò®üò®",1
"Honestly had a fun time with the game, the story is fulfilling, the mechanics while clunky at times is engaging, and building the characters are fun. My and everyone else‚Äôs experience with Gacha games are quite similar. You pay money if you want to advance. However, said Gacha games always (at least the good ones) treat their players like royalty on the anniversary because those companies know that they are making BANK due to said players. Mihoyo seemed like they spit in our eyes, kicked our crotch, and threw dirt on us. 

The anniversary is not what has created this review but it was the last straw from a company that doesn‚Äôt value their player base and sees themselves as high and mighty. 

They ignored player‚Äôs cries with Zhongli, tore us into oblivion with the Raiden and Beidou controversy, and finally betrayed and took advantage of our trust with the anniversary. 

While Genshin is a fun and enjoyable game it sickens me that a company that does not care about their base is in charge. 

Hope you all fix yourselves for the better

Before the door hits you in the face on the way out.",1
"I started playing and it was going really good, I was super happy when i got xiangling, started to play with my friends, and level up characters.. but then I had to update it and it took WAYYY too much storage, that i ended up having to stop playing. me and my friend were heartbroken so i had to end up deleting the game since i needed the storage back and i was super sad because me and my friend were really happy, especially my friend, when she found out I could go on co-op and play with her but now i can‚Äôt anymore :(",4
"The anniversary rewards are garbage, the amount of work you need to put in for one 10 roll is insane, the 3D model for Albedo is obscenely bad, the weapons gacha is a mess, I‚Äôm tired of 1 million waifus being on the banners and when we get a dude he‚Äôs boring or slapped together, a lot of the male models are cheap and look alike. Kazuha is probably one of the worst examples of this, he just looks like Aether recolored. People have supported and funded this game, the fanbase deserves better. Of course this responsibility doesn‚Äôt fall on the employees just doing their job as their told, but it does fall on the people in charge, who need to stop being cheap, and I sure hope the employees are being paid properly.",1
"I honestly enjoy the game. It‚Äôs been a huge hyperfixation of mine and I love the characters and story behind it all, but really? I don‚Äôt have much hope for anniversary rewards, like even a free 4-star would be fine with me, but having fans spend hours on artwork and video editing for prizes pretty much unrelated to the game is pointless. We‚Äôve gotten better rewards from daily log-in events than this, that‚Äôs saying something. I‚Äôm not expecting a free 5-star. I‚Äôm not expecting primogems. I‚Äôm just expecting anything other than the privileged, greedy business that MiHoYo is becoming.",3
"It‚Äôs a pretty dope game. Started playing about a week or so ago. Just wish you could skip through the cutscenes. And maybe replay stories, even if the rewards aren‚Äôt as big the next time around. Also, I had an account but when I went to connect my email, it created a whole new account and erased all my progress, so watch out for that. All in all, no complaints really.

Edit: leveling up your adventure rank is kind of a headache (unless there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing), but still no complaints lol.",4
"The game is amazing itself! I could play all day! But the problems is the storage. I always have to delete photos and apps to play the game. And since I don‚Äôt have enough money to buy more storage, I have to delete over a 100 photos and videos, and delete 2-3 apps on each update, I‚Äôm running out of apps to delete since all of the apps I have are important to me. The update is cool and all, but I need some time to delete things and get more storage for it... *insert sad amber drawing*",4
"I love Genshin, I think that it‚Äôs well put together and that downloading it is really worth it, the story is good and it‚Äôs fun to play, just PLEASE MAKE IT SO YOU CAN TURN OFF A CONSTELLATION, a certain constellation can seem good when you first see it but examples like Bennett‚Äôs C6 that can mess up any team that‚Äôs running physical damage and I believe Zhongli‚Äôs C6 can also be bad for characters like Hu tao which like to be at low hp. Me myself and lots of other people think that it would really improve the game ._.",5
Genshin impact is a good game but when you get to a certain rank things ten to get harder when you level up or rank up while playing sometimes you will have no pimogrms which are use to summon new characters and it‚Äôs just so hard to get them and while doing this the items that you need to evolve your character are hard to get some of the items and you hit a roadblock that‚Äôs why they should make the game a little bit easier and you should get the game it‚Äôs a great game but it still needs some work,3
"Ok so at first I load up my first world and as soon as I started I could only see about 10 feet around me and it was not going away. 
When I started the fight with the dragon (the first boss fight and one that you fight when you are in the air) and I can‚Äôt see anything but a black screen. I hope this is just my game because it is very annoying. Please developers of Genshin impact fix this I can only give it a four star because I can‚Äôt play but the cutscenes and game I got to see was beautiful. Ps not sure if this has any impact but I‚Äôm o a iPad gen 5.",4
"I started late playing the game, and I actually struggled a bit til recently, learned how to use the units. However, i must say it‚Äôs the most wonderful game I‚Äôve played on mobile ever, it‚Äôs actually very f2p friendly, not going to complain about the pity or the banners, because at the end of the day it‚Äôs a gacha game. Therefore, it‚Äôs more of how lucky you are, beside reaching the pity. I seriously wanted to thank each person of the developers team for the amazing and outstanding game.",5
"This games concept, storyline, gameplay, etc. has literally taken over me, I honestly live for this game and their is not one day that I don‚Äôt play genshin. It really has impacted my life in a positive way and has brought me different aspects of life, I feel really honored to find this game and I wouldn‚Äôt call this a really game but a genuine experience. Yes genshin does have some flaws, like the ridiculous over-price primogems, but this game is so amazing and it has brought me so much comfort.",5
"If you stumble upon the ‚Äúsecret of tianqiu valley‚Äù quest, DON‚ÄôT DO IT! Not only is the last level impossible (defeating an ice abyss mage with a shield, 2-3 slimes that freezes you every 3-5 seconds, 2 ice arrow shooting monster thingys all in 60 seconds) you also can‚Äôt co-op until you COMPLETE that quest. I don‚Äôt know who came up with this impossible quest but it seems like it‚Äôs a way to get you to spend more money to build up your characters to complete that quest. This made me stop playing completely, hopefully someone can fix this and just take off the time limit so it‚Äôs more doable.",3
This game has a lot of good in it the world it self is nice and vibrant. The characters are vast and have back story... but fair warning it‚Äôs a pay to win. It‚Äôs missions are much higher level then the average casual player will be I don‚Äôt play often so these missions are kind of a downer but it‚Äôs an amazing game I could go on and on about flaws but it‚Äôs a free mobile open world rpg with a story and endless bad guys if you‚Äôre looking for something you can spend time or money on it‚Äôs an unbelievable game,5
"I realized that this game is exactly like Zelda:Breath of wild.
Why?
I really enjoy the game though but this game is really similar to Zelda.
Is this game made by the creators of Zelda?
Well what ever it is.
Your doing great and I really hope this game doesn‚Äôt get reported for any copies from Zelda like what I have been witnessing in the game.
This game is a good controller supportive.
But honestly, this game is meant to be 9 year old or older game, the little tiny girl is really starting get me paranoid.
Any who,Try to making look-movements-more easier to control for controller support and touch screens please.

P.S:Are you able to add Wanda?
      she seems perfect for magical
      avatars like Lisa but not exactly like Lisa because she really makes me uncomfortable every time she talks to the traveler.
Or something like Wanda or maybe you already did something like what I am saying right now.

I‚Äôve been playing a lot of RPG games over several years none of them are as good as this one. Most of the time these types of games get boring and repetitive but this game had great storytelling and graphics that it just made you feel so immersed with the world and this is a mobile game I‚Äôve seen paid games on mobile they didn‚Äôt have as good graphics is this. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves RPG games and just want to travel around and explore the map because it‚Äôs highly recommended.,5
"The graphics are immaculate, the open world is gigantic, I love how you can pretty much climb anything, I really like the gliding aspect, I love The fighting and the way we can use different elements to mix together for multiple effects, plus The characters and their elemental weapon affects are amazing, it takes a while to build up the fates and primo gems for wishes but it‚Äôs not impossible,The only problem I see so farIs that it‚Äôs causing A lot of peoples phones to overheat besides that problem it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorite games.",5
"This is a great game and all but what is stopping me from giving the game a 5 is because of the unfair rewards. The rewards are kind of disappointing because of all of the time I consumed and the amount of work by defeating enemies and accomplishing quests, we do all that just for 10 or 5 gems? And the wishes are like 1,600 wishes! They are so much!! Creators please for the next update when you add more locations may you please increase the amounts of gems we get for accomplishing a quest? Like to 100 for completing quests and maybe 50 for fighting enemies or something. Please and thank you!",4
"The game is really good and reminds me of the legend of Zelda: breath of the wild but the issue on mobile is the black screen/void thing. Now see I can play the game but I can only see a small radius around me, the rest is just a black void. I‚Äôm only able to play up until the glider part against the dragon cause I can‚Äôt see anything other than a black screen so I‚Äôm stuck on that part. I‚Äôm also playing on iPad Air 2 and I saw other people are having the same issue so it would be nice to be notified when this issue will be fixed.",4
"This truly is a great game. The graphics are amazing and I love just exploring throughout the world. I would love this game so much more if only I could actually play on it smoothly.. This applies to both pc and on mobile but recently it takes longer to actually load the game than it does to play. I can barely play for 5 minutes before the game either freezes completely or just crashes. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating. The times I was able to play, I thoroughly enjoyed. If I could actually play this game smoothly or longer in a session, I would love it even more but it‚Äôs pretty unplayable currently for me.",3
"First 30-40 hours of gameplay are great. Full open world and things to do.

Then endgame hits and you cant do anything

Once story ends very abruptly and you lose all easy ways to get adventure exp, you are stuck doing dailies and burning resin for everything.

Especially burning resin for EVERYTHING

Progression is directly tied to resin since you need resin for any meaningful accumulation for everything.

Leylines for Mora and Character exp? 20 Resin
Artifacts? 20 Resin
Weapon Ascension Mats? 20 Resin
Talent Mats? 20 Resin
Character Ascension Mats? 40 Resin
Weekly bosses that can only be done 1/week? 60 Resin

This would be better if they had a short resin regen and high cap right? 

Regen is 1/8 minutes and the cap is 120

Doing weeklies will take up half of your saved resin, and why bother doing anything else that day? 

This is not including the 6-7 layers of gear RNG tied to each artifact. 

Its a fun one-off at the beginning 30-40 hours of play, but once you hit endgame you should just delete and find something else.

More in-depth complaints and criticisms of the game can be found on the reddit",1
"I love this game so much! The graphics are amazing and the open-world concept is breathtaking. I only wish you could add a few things (1) customizations to our character like you do with the wind glider. (2) I think it would be really cool if there were like two separate stories like, the one that is already in place would be for a single-player game, and then you'd make a new story for like a multiple server game. (where people could make friends and groups and battle together etc.)",5
"The game is great, good battle style great graphics and overall great characters but the main issue is getting the characters, it‚Äôs so hard to get the characters sometimes and to get a 5-star character is almost impossible, I got sooooo lucky with Xiao and Albedo but even those were months in between. Also sometimes the character level gets stuck and you go over the xp count. But all that aside, the gene is really good and if you could fix that it would be a real 5-star review",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for about four days now and love it, it feels like I‚Äôm not playing on mobile game and then I‚Äôm sitting in front of an actual television playing a consul on my iPad. I really wish that this game was controller compatible because if it was I would put thousands of hours into it. I really hope the developers make it controller compatible phone or I might lose interest, since there are so many other games that allow me to use my control while playing them.",5
"Tried downloading and launching this game to almost no avail. After waiting around 5-10 minutes on a white screen I finally get a load screen to login and as I do so it asks me to download 4GB of data to keep playing, which it downloads at less than half the speed of my actual internet capacity. On top of that as I left the game to download the data it crashed again giving me the black and white screen and stopping the download before making me wait 5-10 minutes again for it to load up. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my device or what but I‚Äôve read many posts online about needing to have a very specific type of device to play this game. Is it even worth it??",1
"It‚Äôs like you guys have forgotten about Eula, all the other characters are getting re runs when Eula has not even had her 3rd. SHENEH!?! You guys have let shenhe into 3.5! It‚Äôs time for someone to say this. This game is slowly dying bc some characters are taking to long to get re runs. I know you guys have a lot of new characters coming in but people getting upset about it. Even I am. It‚Äôs cool and all: the new characters and stuff, but please let Eula and the other characters that have not had a re run time to catch up to the others. you guys are losing players and good reviews because of this. I‚Äôm just trying to keep it a good game! -from: AeulaFanthathasbeenwaitingforeula",1
This game is absolutely amazing but there are some drawbacks‚Ä¶One it take a massive amount of storage to download the game. Two it takes about two to three hours to download it fir the first time. Other than that tho the game is unbelievably and beautifully done! It has such a huge setup that the storage it takes is understandable. I would recommend this game to everyone!!! This is the only game I keep coming back to. Keep up the good work Team Genshin!,5
"I love this game so much. I‚Äôve been playing for a long time now! I would‚Äôve loved to give it a 5 star but I spend a lot of money on primos to get the 5 star character I want only for it to give me a 5 star I didn‚Äôt want. I wanted Alhaithem soooooo bad and this is the first time I spent money in this game because I wanted him so but, only to get stupid Diluc. I spent $75 just to get a character I didn‚Äôt want?!?! Come on!! Don‚Äôt cheat me out of this. I am so upset.",4
Honestly I love the game. The scenery is amazing and the graphics are great. The quests never seem to get old and everything is very creative and beautifully made. However the only problem I seem to have with it is how much space it really takes up. It takes around 3 gigabytes to download but just after a few months it now takes up almost 20! I still love the game and would recommend playing it but it takes up a ton of space.,4
"I absolutely love this game, the storyline is great and the characters are amazing, but there‚Äôs not a lot  of darker skinned characters. It‚Äôs not inherently wrong with it but i‚Äôm pretty sure most of the players would appreciate having characters with darker skin like Kaeya and Xinyan.(I hope I spelt that right) Also, theres characters that require items from nations new players don‚Äôt have. For example I have characters from inazuma that require stuff from inazuma, I dont have inazuma so I cant ascend them very far if at all.",4
"Don‚Äôt be fooled, there‚Äôs so many issues with hypersexualizing women on this game. They stack female characters with dps capabilities, revealing clothes and everything to cater to a male audience while refusing to create a good male dps for people who prefer that. Not to mention there is no skin tone representation whatsoever and it‚Äôs pretty lackluster and boring. And it‚Äôs not friendly to people who can‚Äôt afford to spend money. It‚Äôs impossible to get a 5 star weapon you need because of the wishing system and they refuse to acknowledge or change the issues. Don‚Äôt get absorbed in the game just because it‚Äôs popular, they only care about money, not about people‚Äôs opinions. Also the in game rewards are stingy",1
"As a more experienced player, Resin is holding players back from doing anything (ex. character ascension, weapon ascension, talents, etc.) while forcing players to prioritize certain things in the game one at a time. The fact it can take weeks, even months to just to probably max out one character is honestly insane. Farming/Grinding isn‚Äôt that bad, but when you put a limit to how much you can do in a video game, players often leave and may never come back unless something peaks one‚Äôs interest. Please remove Resin from the game. The fact most of the player base is mostly new people shouldn‚Äôt be a thing",2
I've been playing this game almost since launch. Unfortunately while I enjoy this game it needs a great deal of work. The company has shown they do not care about accurately representing the people of cultures they base their regions off of as seen in the recent sumeru update. The resin system needs a big rework as well as other systems. As well as poor optimization for the mobile community. I do believe this game could be greater if the company actually listened to their global audience more. They have said they went to go to a global scale but it's clear they are not actually trying to do that.,2
"When i first started playing genshin, playing kept me busy for a long time. Now, that i am an higher ar rank, i decided to finally write a review.

Basically you and your sister get kidnapped by a unknown god and sent to another world. You meet new characters and farm for artifacts to get stronger.

Like i said earlier, when you first start the game you get many quest and things to do.

However, i have noticed that after ar 20, things get very repetitive. i honestly don't like doing the same things over and over again, to farm books and decent artifacts. in my opinion, even doing daily commissions feel like a chore.

but don't get me wrong, genshin impact is a great game with well designed characters and beautiful terrain.

ignoring the fact that it literally burns up my phone.

like seriously, 10 gb?!

my phone can only handle 32 gb!",4
"Ok to start this off. Great game, the graphics are incredible and its very well made. Yet it is very similar to a popular game from Nintendo called The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. The opening seen where the traveler (Aether is who I picked) is super if almost exactly like the opening to BoTW. Where they stand if the cliff and look out over the land, and wind gliders are basically just the paraglider from BoTW. Now I will say the character switching is a great idea. So that is all I have to say :)

I love this game so much it‚Äôs such a cool game like listen I thought that it was overrated at first and wasn‚Äôt all that fun so I downloaded it and never played it until my friend was like ‚Äúhey have you ever played genshin‚Äù and I was like no but i have it downloaded and they were like ‚Äúalr let‚Äôs play it‚Äù and I says ok so we played and I swear to goodness I‚Äôve been hooked ever since that day and the character designs are so cute and so well detailed and this game is just amazing I truly do recommend it!!,5
"I consider Genshin a terrorist game. The developers of this game support the Russian Federation and their actions, deaths.
I used to love to play Genshin, but after the company of this game refused to pay the Ukrainian brand for advertising, only because of the flag of Ukraine, Genshin fell in my eyes. I started hate this game. It's a disgrace. In Ukraine, people die, little children die every day, people tear off limbs with rockets, they will remain disabled. This is very mean on your part, because millions of Ukrainians played your game. I deleted this game, all my friends deleted this game. It would seem that it is so easy to pay for advertising, but no, you did everything to stop respecting you.

It‚Äôs very good. The story line and main/side quest are the best(not all side quest are enjoyable)but they‚Äôre still rly good. The graphics and overall style is amazing. This game has brought me so much joy and hatred(the good kind) and has gotten me to know many ppl and make new friends. It‚Äôs an addiction. Like I‚Äôm literally addicted to it. With the severs being down rn I don‚Äôt know what to do- it‚Äôs very sad. Nah but if ur interested in the game or feel like you wanna download it you should it great^^,5
"I absolutely adore this game it is amazing and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing it when I downloaded it, because I needed a new game to play but when I started to play it after a while the game keeps forcing itself close and I have to RESTART and open the game again. If anyone knows how to stop or fix this problem that‚Äôll be GREAT. Other than that the games is a HUGE hit and I enjoy it very much. Or the developers if you can please help me out please about this I don‚Äôt know why it keeps resetting",4
"Made a region based off of south Asian culture. Used south Asian clothing, traditions, foods, and other versions of their culture. And yet EVERY CHARACTER except ONE for this new region currently have pale skin, while the people in the regions it (Sumeru) is based off of are largely tan. It is clear that Hoyoverse is picking and choosing what parts of south Asian, especially Vietnamese culture they enjoy and want to conveniently include in their game, and what parts they do not like. It is racist and horrifyingly harmful. And they‚Äôve been VERY DIRECTLY informed of the issue. As a former lover of the game, it is a disgusting a very disappointing outcome. I do not want to force, but do encourage anyone to withhold from spending money on Genshin until this is addressed. Thanks for reading.",1
"yeah so i don‚Äôt really play games very much but i kept seeing this app EVERYWHERE so i thought what‚Äôs the harm i can delete it later if anything. and let me tell you i was not disappointed.
one: THE GRAPHICS HOLY COW SPOT ON. sure it‚Äôs anime ish but get over it this game is cool n the art is what really got me.
two: THE DETAILS. EVERY SIDE CHARACTER (i mean ALL OF THEM) have a story and that makes me happy. also all of the creatures are cool so brownie points.
three: THE STORY. GUT PUNCH AS I WAS EATING POPCORN THANKS FOR THAT. overall this game is amazing and the story just tops it off, and you can‚Äôt really win the game because it keeps going and i love that.
the only thing i hate is the size of the game. anyone with low storage better start deleting stuff because this app has more baggage than i do. 
other than that it‚Äôs an amazing game and i recommend it to all.",5
I played genshin on another ps4 account for awhile for i was at a good ar rank but when i got another ps4 console with another admin account i found out that i couldn‚Äôt use the account anymore and ALL my progress was gone. I think this is very ridiculous because they should make it available to play through other ps4 accounts. I tried different methods and i came across one where i could get my genshin account back but it would delete my progress anyways so it wasn‚Äôt worth it. I just believe that they should make it where you can go back into your genshin account from any ps4 consoles or a third party account.,2
"So I am not an app expert by any means but the only things I‚Äôm finding inconvenient with this game at the moment is the constant updates it requires. They are lengthy and extremely frequent. Not a major issue but as I said, it‚Äôs rather inconvenient. It would also be nice to be able to play some part of the game while offline. I don‚Äôt always have internet access and I would love to be able to play some part of it offline. However I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible.",4
So I have been playing for a while and it's really fun entertaining and addicting the only problem is I have been working hard to get xp for my adventure rank to go up but nothing happens it is completely stuck on the same place and also my friend try's to friend me on the game and I don't see anything at all please fix this I can't play well if nothing happens and plz could you get all the xp I have to me thanksüòå,5
Ok so I play on ps4 and when I use Mona‚Äôs charged attack it won‚Äôt work half the time. Stamina  is all the way up also so it‚Äôs not my Stamina idk if others have had this problem but I do and it‚Äôs quite annoying at times.. like she will just stand there in mid fight while I‚Äôm over here holding down circle to do her changed and it doesn‚Äôt work once I‚Äôm out of a fight it works suddenly again,5
"Hello Genshin Impact, just to let you know, Genshin is the best game for me and will always be. So I just wanna to say.. maybe you should or could bring back some of the old events like the Windblume event, lantern rite festival, Klee‚Äôs event the Golden Archipelago and many of the old Genshin festivals because I I was here when 2.0 was released and I really wanna and probably new Genshin players want to see or play the old festival, so that‚Äôs all I have and just know Genshin is the best game in my opinion. :)",5
"I started playing Genshin Impact in 2020. I played Honkai Impact 3rd as well. When I first started Genshin, the graphics, the storyline and the characters captivated me in their greatness. The character designs, to all the regions and original ideas are wonderful. I truly love Genshin Impact! I don‚Äôt really have any complaints with wishing, and it‚Äôs ok if I loose the 50/50 a few times. The animations and cutscenes in Genshin Impact are high quality. I really recommend Genshin Impact if you are interested in nice Anime RPG games!",5
"This game is overall amazing, I have been playing it for a few weeks now and I‚Äôm already hooked! 

However, starting yesterday, the game has been extremely laggy and glitchy. I‚Äôll try to teleport or open the map or click anything in the top bar, and then the game will freeze and take forever to open it. When I do my commissions, the teleporting issue, alongside the enemies not showing up occurs, and it is extremely irritating. Please help, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on",4
"Alrighty, so I started playing around when ayaka came out and I personally adore this game. The only thing that kind of bothers me is that you crash maybe ever 7-13 minutes on mobile. It‚Äôs pretty annoying but you get used to it eventually. It also takes up a ton of storage and it drains your battery quickly! Overall, I truly recommend this game to anyone who loves combat games. Nothing is scary in the game. I hope this review helps someone<3",5
"Alright so my game keeps going black and I don‚Äôt know what wrong with it, it mostly happens when there‚Äôs a new update or if I‚Äôm in the backpack, map and the multiplayer thing where you can ask you join someone‚Äôs world. doesn‚Äôt happen when fighting at least that I know of, so I hope you can fix it and it‚Äôs not really super annoying just a inconvenience when your trying to do something",5
"Rated 5 stars to get this up here.(really should be 1) Ya so some of us have been playing for a year. 365 days of grinding for daily quests, story quests, archon quests, and the community in the past has always supported.

You have money to burn and are losing many supporters drastically . People are literally quitting  the game they are so upset .",5
"ive loved playing genshin in the past 8 months or so i‚Äôve had my account. i‚Äôve played almost everyday, and i‚Äôm almost ar 56. the late game / end game has gone from bearable to garbage. it is endlessly tedious due to the resin cap and horrible artifact rng. i‚Äôd be fine with this is the company hadn‚Äôt recently stopped communicating with the fan base and their honestly disrespectful treatment of long term players and new players alike with this god awful anniversary. greedy for money & they won‚Äôt be getting more of mine for the foreseeable future lol might change this review if they do literally anything to placate the community bc i WANT to love it again but i just can‚Äôt",2

All my settings are on the lowest they can be and lag still consistently happens. I can‚Äôt even do my daily quest with lag. Now about premogems, you give us very little, and I can‚Äôt spend money on a game just to get a character I want especially because I get like what 30-50 for every daily commission I do.

"The game currently takes up more than 11GB... PLEASE Mihoyo, give us the Switch port!
I haven't been able to play for months because my phone can't handle the size of the app.
Otherwise, this is a game I would easily pay $60 for (minus the gacha ofc). This is absolutely the best free to play game on the market; the open world, the graphics, the characters, the voice acting, the story - it's all wonderful.

TL;DR: Amazing game, Switch port is absolutely necessary.",5
"First of all I love genshin it is my favorite game, but there were some bugs I encountered. For example when wishing on the inazuma banner it took away my primo gems and left me with no reward. And I had been saving up and it is too late now since the banner ends tomorrow. I tried reaching the feedback center but it wouldn‚Äôt allow me, so that‚Äôs the only reason why it gets 4/5 stars. Next time I hope that the issue is resolved and if I can‚Äôt at-least get my 1600 primogems back.",4
"But love it more now that I‚Äôm spending a little. Super fun, lots to do. But I have two very minor requests for the devs that I would LOVE: 1) On mobile (I play on ipad) the chat icon is right next to the directional pad and I keep hitting it accidentally mid-fight as I dash around ‚Äî please move it to the upper left next to the coop icon or something please! And 2) PLEASE get rid of the purple color of sacrificial weapons at the 2nd ascension, they all look so much better with the blue/white color scheme T______T thank you‚Ä¶",5
I love the game it has good graphics and and good to play with friends but however there is a problem with the iOS version of it idk if it‚Äôs just us r not but sometimes I be playing solo and it just cuts off I got restart the whole thing so if you would be so kind to update it for it won‚Äôt cut off the game it would be greatly appreciated I really do need y‚Äôall to fix it for iOS it gets a bit annoying when it just kicks me off,5
"So, when I was doing thaw all shards out for the quest. I accidentally used all of my rose quarts things. So I can‚Äôt thaw out one shard. And when I find other shards and try to run back to that shard, it disappears. So, I‚Äôm not sure if this is a bug if the rose quarts don‚Äôt reappear if you accidentally use all of them on a shard. Still, I‚Äôm kinda disappointed this is happening. Though, I know that you guys just released the game on September. So! There may be a few problems with the game. It‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs just. It has a few problems to be fixed.",4
"I‚Äôm gonna keep this short. It‚Äôs an amazing game. There‚Äôs like one glitch I‚Äôve encountered but it was hilarious. One tip though.. I think buying fates should be cheaper because the players who don‚Äôt spend money on the game (e.g me) sometimes have to work for a few days to get 160 primogems just to buy one fate, and a lot of time they only get weapons (weapons are useful I know). That was my only issue with the game if you can even call it that. Not big enough to remove a star.",5
This is my second time playing a RPG and it makes the experience for me really fun the game gives incredible graphics and characters some challenges are hard but I think I just need to try harder but I think that Genshin impact should 1.

I‚Äôve seen this in previous mobile games where you can turn your ringer off and have music playing on the same device at the same time. I am one of many who listens to music non-stop and this would be a great way for me and everyone else to find a way to make this the most enjoyable. Other than that I have absolutely NO COMPLAINTS, and love this game so keep up the good work!",5
"Even though I don‚Äôt play it on mobile I just played for a couple of hours and it was soo fun! The environment is so gorgeous, the story is well written, and the all the characters can be funny at some points, like paimon. Usually I don‚Äôt like rpg games that much but when I started playing this, it was so amazing! Some mechanics of the game are somewhat like Zelda Breath of the wild. The stamina for example. Overall I see no flaws with this game and I highly recommend you get this.",5
I‚Äôve heard so much about this game and it‚Äôs at all odds a truly amazing game. I wanted to play it when I first saw it over a year ago. I downloaded it and tried opening it. It would get to the genshin impact at the beginning and stop. I just tried after months of the game sitting on my phone and the same results. I finally checked here and saw the compatibility of phones for the game and realized I missed that when I got the game. I have a iPhone 6s. My only request is to see if y‚Äôall can make it possible to run the game on my phone. Thank you for your time!,3
"I never thought that I would be able love a game so much. Just hearing the game start up excites me. This is one terrific game, especially since i love anime that takes you in another, i always wanted to know what it felt and this game give that feeling. Also, since I have school and I get super stressed out. I now have something to look forward to after my assignments or just when I am relaxing. Continue the good work!!! This made game made my entire year.",5
I‚Äôve only started to play this game on mobile for a few now and it‚Äôs very addicting! I love rpng games like these and it‚Äôs much more intriguing when the game is on a gaming console but the only bummer is that we can link or pass any of our progress from our mobile game to our console game. In which you will have to restart the whole game again in which I find it quite irritating and disappointing but I mean I guess there‚Äôs no way around it :(,5
This game is awesome it has great graphics there is a good story there‚Äôs a lot of crafting and it‚Äôs really fun in my opinion if you never played this game I really recommend you should this is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played like you can even GLIDE you cant go wrong with a good story flying gliding doing quests cooking food that gives you hp finishing temples upgrading your character getting more characters it‚Äôs just a great game and you can‚Äôt go wrong with this game if you hate this game you don‚Äôt have a good taste in games,5
this game is very addicting and is very fun especially with the banners and events that always take place! There‚Äôs so much to do and the the graphics are amazing I love how all the characters look! I do wish that people could trade characters instead of having to become broke haha but I won‚Äôt take it of my rating since I do understand the circumstances but overall this is a must need if you like adventure games with an amazing big storyline! I looks forward to more things coming out on genshin!,5
"I really live this game and I‚Äôve been addicted since downloading it. The graphics are amazing and so is the story. However, I have been struggling with it crashing on me. It happens frequently, at least once an hour, and it‚Äôs kind of frustrating. That being said, I am not being that harsh because the quality of the game makes me understand why it would crash so much. I like it a lot and maybe it‚Äôs my fault that it‚Äôs crashing because I‚Äôm using an iPhone 8, but it would be really great if that could be fixed somehow.",4
"I bought a game pad for my iPhone just so I could have a more comfortable gaming experience to play this game specifically. Sadly this game doesn‚Äôt support controllers for iOS. The Switch/PS4/PC versions do which is why this came as a surprise. I hope this can be a easy add in for the developers as it would extremely improve the experience for those who have clumsy hands and enjoy seeing the art and graphics on the whole screen un-obscured by their own thumbs.
(Will definitely jump up star rating when/if this is added. Low score is only to hope it‚Äôll show the importance for this feature to push it being added)",2
"i am absolutely stunned by this game! as someone who loves video games and would like to take them wherever i go, having a game like this one on my phone that works without wifi? i literally couldn‚Äôt ask for more! AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THISE GRAPHICS!! it is literally as visually pleasing as Breath of The Wild and has similar game mechanics! i‚Äôm not even that far in and my party is incredibly strong! and i love things that has luck based rewards like the wishing ugh i just absolutely love this game, great job to all of the people who help develop this game!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Ive been plating Genshin for about two months now and I have gotten a lot of stuff but their Primo gem Wish system is getting on my nerves. I spend at least 2 days collecting 1600 primo gems to get 10 wish circle things. I go and buy a pack for a new character , one of my favorite parts of the game, and it ONLY gives me weapons. I haven't gotten a new character in weeks. So if you guys could just turn up the probability for characters a little higher that would be awesome.",5
"This game has so much potential and hype featuring great combat and graphics with a beautiful open world and character design. It will pull you in and for a while and it will feel great , the first saga and 20 or so adventure rank levels will few so grand and immersive. However at this point , is when you start to see what you are getting yourself into; your adventure soon turns into incredible repetitive grind and extremely expensive cash grab and monetization barrier, and these are just a few of the problems keeping this game from being the true wonder we all thought it was.",3
"This game is amazing. The world is HUGE. There‚Äôs so much to do( craft a bunch of different things, side missions, main missions, so many different leveled chests, searching for ingredients, timed trials, domains, etc etc etc). The characters and all you can do to level them up is honestly extraordinary. There so many fine details and I can not keep talking about this game.

It‚Äôs not one of those games where it‚Äôs free to download but to play you need real money. Of course you can use real money for either in game money or a battle pass to get more rewards, but it‚Äôs completely unnecessary. 

Not to mention, on top of the huge map, there‚Äôs a mother full sized map surrounded the accessible areas that are yet to be released. Or at least at my level (adventure rank 22, characters and weapons at level 40). 

Just download this game, you will NOT be let down.",5
"Ok first of all, this game is so good. Good combat, lore, story, leveling system and mechanics, stunning graphics. It‚Äôs just loss of words. But the only reason this is a 4 star is because it‚Äôs keep crashing (,even in all low graphics settings). It‚Äôs could be that I am playing on a IPhone 8 and not the ones that are recommended devices for playing. Even so, it kinda annoying to crash in random times. So please try to fix this issue, I don‚Äôt want it to crash all the time throughout the wonderful gameplay of Genish Impact.",4
"I love the graphics they are the best graphics I‚Äôve seen on mobile, nothing is laggy which is amazing and surprising. I love how are you have a variety of different players to play, so that you won‚Äôt be bored playing the same character. I love the thought process that has been put into this game. It‚Äôs just amazing and I‚Äôm obsessed! Great job keep doing what your doing I‚Äôm looking forward to see what other games you have!BUT I WISH YALL MADE IT WERE U CAN RIDE AND CALL ON THE DRAGON:( What‚Äôs the point of having a dragon if you can‚Äôt interact with it :(",5
I waste 150 dollars to get venti and I didn‚Äôt get it what a scam game is this I‚Äôm deleting the game return back to call of duty I pay for battle pass and I get what I want as long I pay so they ask for lvl up before session end and also some package u will find in store but this game chase for 5 star like pain to get I don‚Äôt like the system also u need to get 6 venti to max lvl I lost 150 dollars for nothing so they want me to pay almost 500 or 1000 what about to get all 6 venti is that will cost me 5000 dollars hell no I go bought pro game pc with that price this system are scum üëéüòí not worth to play it definitely scam game to back play call of duty rules so simple battle pass & package easy to get what u want but this game are scum,1
"This game is seriously so amazing! It‚Äôs genuinely the best looking iPhone game I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm constantly in awe of the sights and the amazing world that it thrusts you into. As far as and open world rpg goes, it does everything just right. The leveling is satisfying, the upgrades are done well, and the gotcha type mechanic for getting more characters keeps you excited for that next great pull. I know that I‚Äôm going to get more and more into this game as we speak and I‚Äôm so glad that something this ground braking finally hit the market!",5
"Very good game. Should be 5 stars but theres 2 major issues i have with the game. 1) the game keeps crashing on my laptop and ive tried every possible fix and none of them work. 2) since i cant play on laptop, i can only play on mobile now and the camera is SO frustrating to work with during combat. It keeps zooming in on my character especially during tight spaces and its difficult to see the enemies and where i am. Just remove the zoom... it literally doesnt do anything other than ruining user experience during fights",4
"Ok this is gonna be an extremely short review but I just wanted to ask if you guys can please please pleaseeee add controller support to this game. I havent reall gotten that far in the game or actually i just started playing it but im not much of a mobile player, i dont have a console anymore so im not able to play this amazing game on console but i do have the controllers i jus lt wish i was able to use it and play like that. Plz answer respond to this review and let me know if there gonna be controller support anytime soon. Thank you!üòÅ",5
It's a amazing game. I've been playing since 2021 but I get so frustrated when a new update comes out because I never have the storage for it. It's been a few months since I've been able to play it because of the storage problem. I don't have enough money to get a pc or anything with more storage and I know theres nothing you can really do about it but I just thought I should share this. It fakes up about 20+ GB from my phone and it makes me a little upset how I can't play it,4
"For a mobile game, it‚Äôs quite impressive what they were able to accomplish (hence why it‚Äôs 2 and not 1 stars), but the title says it all and let‚Äôs not beat around the bush. 

This is Gacha at its worst. Required for progression in the form of the absolute best characters and weapons with no alternatives, stingy as hell after frontloading is over, rates being actual garbage compared to something like Dragalia Lost, and dupes of ultra-rare-due-to-terrible-rates stuff being required to max out power. It‚Äôs blatant pay to win and honestly ruins what could otherwise be an innocent RPG taking direct inspiration from BotW, but alas, greed has once again corrupted a promising venture.",2
"I WISHED 90 TIMES ON STANDARD AND GOT A 5-STAR WEAPON 2 TIMES. I was devastated!! I swore if I didn‚Äôt get a 5 star Character I would give genshin a bad review. But other than that this is a 5-star game. I love it ( I just have that it gave me a 5-star weapon and not a character)! It has good graphics and I love games where you can explore and it even has dialogue!! My fav character is Layla. She‚Äôs adorable and I love the names of their characters, like Qiqi, Hu-Tao, Yae Miko, and Ganyu!! Such unique names!! I love it. But yes I‚Äôm sorry for giving it a bad review, it is such a good game!! ( 3 star is a bad review in my opinion bc I cant give Genshin a 1 star review. )",3
"Stuck in anti-raider shogun training, please consider that some mobile players don‚Äôt have the best reflex/vision and this quest is way too hard. Tried multiple times and simply discouraged that I cannot progress further because it is part of the main story quest. Looked online and many people are stuck like I am. I understand a side quest or mini game being more difficult and I think rewarding good players is great but why should a main story quest be so hard?! I just want to play casually and enjoy the story. Deleted the game and won‚Äôt spend any more money because I can‚Äôt play/progress.",2
"Hi! I love this game and all the amazing features of it. The characters are really unique. But something I would like to recommend, is that what if you could add five primo gems daily? I think that this would be better because then you don‚Äôt have to rely on the commission quests being to hard and it‚Äôs not to much so that would just wish instead of play. But overall, the game is really good and I would play as many times as I can. Thank you! 

PS: This is just a recommendation. Not a must have.",4
"The game is beautiful. The music is nice. Characters are enjoyable. But the amount of gridding you have to do is horrible. To upgrade characters, to get better weapons, to unlock characters, to access quests, ect. Half the time spent in game is grinding. 

Not to mention the quests that aren‚Äôt story related are incredibly boring and repetitive. They just don‚Äôt require dialogue. Yet at points it feels like you are skipping through pages of conversation. 

But most of the time the game is fun!",4
"Hello. Before I start my feedback I would like to say, merry LATE Christmas. It sounds wrong but personally I have to talk about this game. Well.. I‚Äôm pretty concerned that the game made some things very realistic but that‚Äôs not the only fact about it. At least everything costs real life money. Not only in this game, in other games (ex; roblox,Minecraft,Fortnite,toca boca nd etc..) I think it‚Äôs not only from me, other people to. I‚Äôm definitely SHOCKED by the money. It‚Äôs alright, other games cost money but not THIS  MUCH. i Hope that the creators will help about this fact. Thank you for you attention.",3
"This game is great because for one there are updates almost every month, the story is compelling and detailed, the one thing that isn‚Äôt to my liking is that when you don‚Äôt have enough Primogems you need to either have to buy the gems or just skip the character you want until you have primogems again. It‚Äôs also very addictive with the daily commissions and the weekly bosses even the level up materials are daily. 

If you read this hope you have a nice day.",4
"I like the game but its very hard to get characters your pity for getting characters has to be very high if you even want a chance at getting a five star, and wishes are very expensive if you buy them with real world money or just working for the primogems. But the two things I hate about Genshin Impact the most is you can‚Äôt join your friend when they need your help or you need theirs, also its very hard to get pages to level up your characters. You could even be working on a domain for over an hour and have to start all over again.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since it was just Mondstadt on the map and I‚Äôve loved it ever since! The creators keep you on your toes with every new update and it‚Äôs crazy!! One thing I would love to see in the game, more than anything, is if the traveler got a new outfit for every region and could switch through them. I think it would be an amazing add on and it would make the experience so much more world like!",5
"now don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì i love genshin to death ‚Äì but there‚Äôs no way i‚Äôll get into college (with with the toll genshin‚Äôs been taking on my grades). 1 year to go; let‚Äôs hope this game miraculously makes me smarter :/

nevertheless, it‚Äôs so fun i‚Äôd recommend it to anyone, addiction or no :) if there‚Äôs not enough endgame content, just create an alt and start on over again <3 (i‚Äôve found that to be a highly ‚ú®satisfactory‚ú® method)

anywho-what-where and when, good day and HOYOVERSE GIMME SHENHE",5
"ive been playing Genshin since 1.1 and its amazing and honestly addicting (i got my dad really into genshin when he injured his back last year). the only thing i dont like about this game is the primogem system. not counting quests-without welkin it takes three days to get one wish. even with welkin you only get 150 primogems a day, you dont log on for a day and you miss the 90 primos for the day. i also wish there were more fun interactive events like the midsummer island adventure with the golden apple archipelago.",4
"I‚Äôve been playing Genshin since it‚Äôs release and there‚Äôs no other game out there right now that competes with Hoyoverse‚Äôs detail and care to this game. Though this game is great it can do better, diversity is always something they promise to bring but have failed to do just that (only currently 2 people of color in game). The game can be boring when there‚Äôs no big updates but the one good thing about that is they‚Äôre trying to fix that. I‚Äôd recommend playing this game but get used to disappointment every now and again.",3
"The diversity is honestly lack luster compared to other games I‚Äôve played with different body types and skin color this game will never compare, out of the whole character selection there is only TWO characters with darker skin. Isn‚Äôt this game supposed to be a game about the different cultures and representation of our human world how are they failing something they started. It‚Äôs not  even mobile friendly because of the space it takes up. BAD BAD BAD ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",5
"The new leaks about characters in Sumeru is extremely disappointing and disrespectful to see. Having stereotypical depictions and insulting animations to Islamic and Muslim culture a long with outright saying the region is based on South Asia, only to proceed in making every single character INCLUDING the god of the region white? It‚Äôs disgusting. You‚Äôd think Hoyoverse would take other cultures as seriously as they‚Äôve taken Liyue and Inazuma‚Äôs cultures, but they haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs dissapointing. Canonically Kaeya is South Asian, so Hoyoverse is aware that south Asian people come with a variety of skin tones. So why are they all white? It‚Äôs excuses. I won‚Äôt be putting any money or support in this game until something is done with the lack of diversity in this game. There is no excuse.",1
"I don‚Äôt leave reviews often, but I felt that this game deserved it. If your a mobile player, you‚Äôll be amazed at the high resolution and breathtaking design. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with this game. It‚Äôs perfect in every way.

It‚Äôs creative and free, and for the most part, rarely pay to win. Unless, of course, your wishing. But this isn‚Äôt a paid game, after all. It shouldn‚Äôt matter as much, the full investment into your satisfaction should make up for it.

People may notice how much space this game takes up, even on something like a console or PC. I recommend to mobile players to please save up space beforehand. Especially if you are playing on a phone or iPad.

Thank you for taking the time to read. Please consider downloading, maybe I‚Äôll find you!",5
"I loved playing it! It was so fun! It was not like other RPG I played because the other ones were 2D this game was 3D. I loved playing it until it wanted me to download the full version. When I tried downloading it, it said that I had ‚Äúinsufficient storage space‚Äù and then I went to delete all my photos and all my games and apps. But when I got back on to download it, it still said insufficient storage space! I was so mad that I deleted it and then begged my parents to get me a new phone so I could play it.",4
"Ok this app is amazing! The designs, the rpg and the characters are great! It‚Äôs just one thing. First off it takes up so much storage! I love playing but I can afford 10 GB just for a game. Also getting primo gems. You guys are doing a lot better at giving out primo gems but the thing is after you reach a point where you‚Äôve opened all the chest, got everything you can, it kind of becomes pointless. There is no way to get primo gems after that point. Please add more ways to get primo gems.",4
"Love this game, amazing and so fun! My only issue is the favoritism for the protagonist/antagonist Aether depending on who you picked. Lumine is hardly ever on adds, events, ect. She‚Äôs never been in a add if I think about it and is hardly on chibi birthday art. During in events if you picked lumine as your protagonist during events showing the twins you‚Äôll NEVER see lumine. Even if you picked her you‚Äôll see the antagonist Aether if you picked lumine which makes no sense.",5
"Genshin is an amazing game! Amazing story, amazing graphics, and amazing characters. Many say that the artifacts being random aren‚Äôt unfair but the fact that you don‚Äôt get what you want immediately is amazing! The wishing system is well balanced, it‚Äôs fair and makes since. The only problem is the mobile storage, again it makes since it‚Äôs a higher graphic game and on mobile devices you have things like messages and photos stuffing up ur space.",5
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, this game has made my life better, and it is so fun to play, but the amount of storage it takes up is ridiculous. 24 GB? That is beyond crazy. Also, the game is turning into pay to win. I am a PTW player, but F2P players save so much wishing just to not have enough time, or lose their 50/50. Even if it‚Äôs guaranteed, it‚Äôs not like they want the 5* they got. My friend, F2P, at 13 pity, got kokomi. She is good, but it made my friend stop playing and sell her acc. Overall, Great, but has flaws.",4
dear genshin I have been playing Since 4/7/21 I think or it was 4/5/21 anyways I love this game so much. I never would have met some of my best friends if this game did not exist. I really hope the game gets even better! And I do think honki impact and genshin impact are connected! Like the unknown god is from honki and yae miko and Ei is kinda like the characters from honki. I loved this game for so long when I first played this I loved it I played it all the time! Tysm for what you have done for me! I love you!,5
"I liked this game but it took up a lot of storage and for me it gets boring easily. It‚Äôs hard to earn stuff and I know it‚Äôs the point of the game. I had to delete 6 apps for this game, IT would of been nice if it took less storage. It‚Äôs fun but since it took alottt of storage I restricted from doing the things I love like editing, drawing, and playing the games I used to have. It‚Äôs a real pain it took alot of storage since my device doesn‚Äôt have much. I guess if you have alot of storage you could of played this game but if not don‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs fun battle and see the charectors.",3
"I love genshin impact and hu Tao came out. I‚Äôm trying to get genesis crystals but u made it to where I need to purchase on my registered device, WELL I‚Äôm on my iPad, and the reason why I got the game on pc is because my iPad is saying low quality of network and by the way, I don‚Äôt have a VPN, my network is perfectly fine which is what my dad says, I restarted my genshin all I‚Äôm saying is what do I do? Please make it so u can buy genesis crystals on any device, please? I really love hu Tao.",4
This game is amazing but I wanted to know if you could fix a bug I found?when ever I play in co-op or sometimes I‚Äôm not my enemy won‚Äôt spawn fast or sometimes it won‚Äôt spawn at all or when I open my chest it take forever to drop the items and my map take a little time to open and at first I thought it was my wife but it happens even if I have amazing WiFi or service I don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs happening with it but can you guys please fix this glitch? Thank you for your amazing game,4
"I love this game! The graphics are amazing and the story is outstanding! Just one thing though, the Gacha system is a bit hard to deal with. I mean I hadn‚Äôt gotten a 5 star character since kazuha who I had just been wishing in for pity. Before then I hadn‚Äôt gotten a banner character since diluc when I first started playing. I got tartaglia only because of pity but I have a feeling I won‚Äôt be getting another 5 star until fontain comes out so just a bit worried here. Everything else about this game is great!",4
"I like it a lot and it reminds me of breath of the wild- it‚Äôs got a lot more characters and I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs able to run on a phone but the only reason it lost a star was because I can‚Äôt play for more than about 20 minutes before my phone starts to heat up, I‚Äôm trying to preserve its battery so I might have to just play this game on the computer instead. I understand it‚Äôs hard to put so much into a game without straining a phone but i do hope it‚Äôs something that can be worked with",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time now, and I just can‚Äôt help but see how ‚ú®amazing‚ú® this game is. The storyline, characters, visuals‚Ä¶everything is just so perfect! This is like the only game that I‚Äôve been playing for a long time and still haven‚Äôt got bored of. If you haven‚Äôt downloaded this game yet, you definitely should! *Note: This game takes up a lot of your storage space on your device, but it‚Äôs 100% worth it",5
"i‚Äôve been playing genshin from nearly launch. from then i have spent money, time, and love on this game. it‚Äôs a great game and i would recommend it to nearly anyone. but upon realizing how much the company doesn‚Äôt care for it‚Äôs players i will no longer be recommending nor playing. over the past few months the content within genshin has become abysmal and if you‚Äôre looking for a game with a strong storyline and puzzle only for those things to fall off completely later on this is the game for you. while it‚Äôs contents with liyue made it‚Äôs a very strong game it‚Äôs latest additions with inazuma have only served to weaken the game. the characters have been continuously weaker in play style and design and most importantly story. the exploration within inazuma is not nearly as saturated as liyue and has lost its compelling quests compared to its counterpart. not only that but upon releasing what they would be doing for the 1 year anniversary has been all the more telling that this game, truly does not care for its fan base.",1
"I don‚Äôt care if this comment gets deleted but it needed to be said. The rewards for this game are extremely cheap, but the amount of money you spend on it and they want is wayy too expensive. Take this anniversary event for instance, 60, 90, and a 10 fates login event. I would love that for an actual event but for the anniversary? Cmon mihoyo you can do better than that. I feel as if this game is just a cash grab. At first they would listen to you and give you amazing rewards but after it got popular and they got money the devs just stopped caring. Definitely should be better rewards compared to the fanart, fanfics, and money that we‚Äôve given them. Would overall NOT recommend.",1
"Genshin impact is one of the best games I‚Äôve ever played. It has so much to do, and it‚Äôs really been quite the adventure. The overall story and character development is incredible, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever found a game that I enjoy so much. I hope that it continues growing but still goes back on stuff that people might‚Äôve missed. Thank you miHoYo, for the amazing game that I will forever remember. 

(can we have a Xiao rerun soon? I missed his banner and I really want him.)",5
"I have played and genshin impact for 359 days as of writing this review, unlike other gatcha games that give back to the community Mihoyo doesn‚Äôt, i have spent over 1000$ on this game thinking things will change but unfortunately today was the anniversary and all we got was a web browser event that gives u a 100 of the currency of the game ( u need 160 to make a single summon/wish ) and thats just disappointing. Know me saying this I don‚Äôt hate the game but i was expecting more, but who cares as long as they can milk us for bad characters and not listening to what we want",3
"*THIS IS A GACHA GAME*
Let me first start by saying that my friends had me download this game in March of 2021, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I can‚Äôt stop playing, even when I‚Äôve run out of things to do. The scenery is BEAUTIFUL, and the glitches are hilarious. I personally haven‚Äôt found a game that cold hold my attention this long but it‚Äôs worth it. Please keep in mind that it‚Äôs a gacha game. You CAN F2P, but keep in mind that some people don‚Äôt, and they help keep it up and running. Try the game out!",5
"When it comes to mobile games, I usually get bored and delete them especially if i have to pay money to have a good experience, but Genshin has been able to make me quite addicted! I love the breathtaking graphics in this game and the endless amount of quests always keep me hooked. The difficulty level is just right. 10/10 there needs to be more mobile games like Genshin out there! üò©üò©",5
I haven‚Äôt played the game yet but I‚Äôve seen videos and pictures on social media. So when I downloaded it I signed in and bla bla bla. But when I try to play the game it says ‚Äúinsufficient storage space‚Äù When I saw that I though to delete some apps and pictures. So I did. After that I tried to play the game it still says ‚Äúinsufficient storage space‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if my iPad needs a update or the app is too much for my iPad but it still doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm sure the game is fun but if you can fix this situation please do.,4
"This game is amazing. Graphics are awesome. So much detail was put into it. My only real complaint is that I was hoping for more of an mmorpg. It feels so empty and can get dull when there isn‚Äôt other random players running around, Especially since I don‚Äôt have any other friends playing the game. It would be nice to see servers and more character customization so people could meet in game and help each other out and build friendships. Still the nicest looking mobile game I have seen though. üëçüèª",4
"Haha yeah, me again! I managed to (somehow ) download the game but now it needs to download all its files! I had quite some trouble logging back in- I had to change my password >:( better than nothing though! Anyways while downloading it keeps on saying I don‚Äôt have enough ‚Äòstorage space‚Äô when I keep on deleting stuff! I mean it hasn‚Äôt even downloaded 1KB yet! And I have 176GB it‚Äôs honestly quite frustrating!
I‚Äôm worried all my progress hasn‚Äôt saved! It would be tiring to have to reach AR34 all over again‚Ä¶",4
"the game is very good!!! from my experience u can do anything in this game. but I‚Äôm also having an issue.. let me explain this. The quest ‚Äúcalm before the storm‚Äù has disappeared. When I‚Äôm trying to look for the carts full of cor lapis I just can‚Äôt see any, and I also really wanna coop with my friends and also for them to help me with bosses. Mind if you fix this? I‚Äôm really hoping you can. Well otherwise, very good game. Now goodbye! :)",5
"This is my favorite game! The graphics are gorgeous and the story and characters are amazing! The exploration and combat are fun! The game isn't complete yet and they will be adding lots more new content in the future! Characters and some weapons are obtained through a blind box system so you might not always get the character that you want. The rates are pretty fair and you can always get more gems by doing quests and events. Overall, awesome game that deserves all the hype!",5
"Hello, I am going to talk about the pros and cons of thist game and a con is the storage, it takes 15 gigs for the latest update and that‚Äôs half my storage IK it‚Äôs a open world game but don‚Äôt you think the gigs are too much plzzzzzzz make files more compact or something to make the gigs lower and the pros is the game is pretty the charechters are well designed and there‚Äôs a bunch of lore that are referencing China like hu taus butter flies 

Thanks for your time also I apologize for the gramatic misspelling also you may be asking why did I rate thist game 1 star and that‚Äôs because it will get more attention of people that whant to know what people don‚Äôt like and hopefully developers will see it that‚Äôs why I rated it so low",1
"Genshin impact is an awesome game BESIDES the party slots. I very much do not like how you can only have four characters in a party because it‚Äôs a hassle having to switch character to character just to get a flower, ya know? Overall a great game, the storyline is basically a never ending flawless and addicting play. I would have given Genshin five stars if the parties could have five characters instead of six. I think it‚Äôs a pretty fair compromise. Thanks for reading and Genshin.... change your parties to have five characters please and thank you :))",4
"This is probably the best gacha game I‚Äôve ever played. It keeps getting better and better. Updates about every month, even less. Character outfits, surveys, amazing ost, good characters, domains are fun- I can keep going on but, there‚Äôs so much I won‚Äôt even be able to write anymore. But my main reason why I love the game is because the graphics, story line, and art is just so beautiful. It makes me feel like it‚Äôs a real place. And I love this game just so so very much<3",5
"This is one of my most favorite games. It‚Äôs super high quality and the graphics are INSANE.. I‚Äôm pretty sure some of the things in game are inspired by BOTW but even if it is, it‚Äôs still a really good game. The characters in game are also outstanding, Klee is also one of my favorite characters. This game is very addicting, the gacha part of it just loves to swallow all of my gems away lol. If you ever have time please download and put some time into playing this game. I HIGHLY recommend it. <3",5
"I really like this game and I‚Äôve been playing it for some time now, but after the newest update it‚Äôs been almost impossible to play the game. My game crashes every couple of minutes or even seconds. I‚Äôve free‚Äôd pretty much all of of my space and it still won‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve deleted it and reinstalled it but nothing is working.

Anyways on a good note, this game is very fun to play. The visuals are great, the music is great, it‚Äôs a very good game. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to fix my game so it works again.",4
"The effort put into the littlest of details and the game itself is truly just astonishing. It‚Äôs honestly the most underrated game I‚Äôve ever played. I play this game everyday with no regrets. It sometimes even makes me feel like I‚Äôm connected to the characters which makes me delighted, but is a bitter feeling at the same time since I knew that they weren‚Äôt real people. People may think that is just a game, but to me it‚Äôs a change. Thank you, miHoYo.",5
"the game is very good, quests & bosses are fun to do! Playing with other people is very fun as well!! But. I have some problems, I‚Äôm ar 40 and i have done all of my quests I feel like there‚Äôs nothing to do ?? I really hope mihoyo adds more quests. And also the security needs to be fixed! Lots of people are getting hacked easily!! i wish it was fixed since people have worked very hard getting everything just to be hacked, other then that the quality,audio,battles are amazing! It‚Äôs worth getting!",4
"This game does have features from BOTW but it‚Äôs so refreshing in its style! The characters are absolutely stunning and I love having to match character types up in order to larger damage points on an enemy!
However... 
There is a problem when it comes to the game crashing I can play it maybe for 20 or 25 minutes before it crashes though everything saves and I‚Äôm right where I was before it crashes it does throw off the groove of the gameplay I really really hope this gets fixed soon.
But overall it‚Äôs a really nice game!",4
"I have a obsession with beautiful scenery and sound audios! This game is amazing and helps me stay calm 24/7 i have bene looking for some good anime games that didnt have 17+ content and this game was perfect! I love that its also on mobile too! I love the difficulty to fight, it helps me get a target un my brain to fight them and win, this is a perfect game that i would recommend to anyone. If you adore doing battles and missions then this is the game for you! When i first started as a twin and i heard paimon i started squealing, her design is soo cute!! ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫üíóüíóüíó",5
"Genshin impact is a great game, there are no glitches and no problems, the characters are amazing and the storylines are also, all of the towns are so unique, I do have a suggestion it might be hard to do but I really would like if you could cut down trees and collect wood and like, build a house it would be nice but I could live without it, plus also I like how you can change the graphics and it telling you if it lags or not but I will lag no matter what, it‚Äôs not a problem though.",5
"Seriously the best adventure open world game on mobile ever existed. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª thank u for this beautiful and fascinating game . The sceneries the quests the hidden stuff the fighting.. everything you need is in this fully created world . Wow üíöüíöüíö

Im hoping later after we cured the dragon , i can use it to fly around .. it would be soooo awesome , and incredible. Cause some of the material is all in the sky out of reach so i don‚Äôt know it may be already like that. If it‚Äôs not please make that happen. Fly with the dragon all over the map ...",5
"First, I just wanna say that this game is amazing and that the characters and gameplay are extremely great, along with the storyline. 

The issue that I have is with the Scarlet Quartz in the ‚ÄúThaw the shards‚Äù quest and them respawing. The ‚ÄúEntombed City Outskirts is the shard that I‚Äôm talking about. I broke all the scarlet quartz then accidentally hit one of the ice shards instead of what I‚Äôm supposed to, so I‚Äôm one hit short of completely thawing the shard. Are the quartz supposed to respawn or is it me?",5
My friend introduced me to this game and I‚Äôve been having so much fun playing it for the past two months! I really enjoy how beautiful it is and that even though there is in app purchases you can play without buying upgrades and level your character by exploring the world. I have been really having cabin fever with lockdowns so it‚Äôs been a wonderful to escape and have my travel craving filled by exploring this lovely world and discovering the story.,5
"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH ITS SO GOOD!But...there is only one problem, for missions you get about 10gems,sometimes 20 but rarely over 10, and we need 160 gems to roll for a character or weapon....160 is way to much because most missions only give you 10 gems, and because of that you have to go on 16 missions to roll for ONE character and almost every single time....all you get is trashy weapons.....all I‚Äôm asking is to lower the price for gems for roll...other than that THIS GAME WOULD BE THE BEST",5
"It‚Äôs near impossible to reach pity for the banner 5 star hero. And it‚Äôs not even guaranteed. I managed to FINALLY get a 5 star and I absolutely hate that it‚Äôs random. It should be guaranteed. Furthermore, it‚Äôs very difficult to level up artifacts. There needs to be a material that focuses on level up for artifacts like there are for weapons. Weapons that are 4 star and above are extremely difficult to get, let alone duplicates to refine. I‚Äôm stuck with a bunch of 3 star weapons, and unrefined 4 star weapons. I played since the day of launch and that has not changed. The resin system is horrible. Condensed resin should not have a cap, and the cap for resin should be raised. I‚Äôm having a hard time staying interested in this game.",2
"I love it so far, but there‚Äôs some things that would be interesting. Moods of a character, relationships in the game with a character, friendship levels, I also noticed a lot of npcs say the same thing when you approach them, I would like that to change as your friendship grows bigger, and maybe be able to give gifts to characters, like sucrose and all the other characters! Overall this is a amazing game. I‚Äôm begging for my friends to get it to play with them. Heh",5
"I never thought that an app can be like this, I saw this at the top best games in the App Store so, I tried it out. I absolutely loved it, and I still do! This game has a unique style to it, and it a free exploration game. So if you like The Legend of Zelda (BOTW), this is your game. They‚Äôre are a few complaints though, I really wish you can get different armory, but I understand this is an app. I also wish you can create your own character. Still, this game is the best app I‚Äôve ever played! Please download if you haven't already.",5
"I just started this game today, and I really like it! It‚Äôs plot, characters, combat, mechanics, and open-world make it really worthwhile! The only thing I have to say is that you will probably enjoy it more on computer. The controls on IPad or phone are a bit harder, but that‚Äôs not why. On a mobile device, it crashes a TON. For my 1 year old iPad, it crashes whenever a cutscene activates or when I try to cook. Hopefully they‚Äôll patch this in an update. I hope you don‚Äôt have any problems with that and enjoy the game!",5
"To be completely honest, I didn't think I would like this game! I thought it would be some anime game in a sea of trashy games but I was WRONG. This gem made me embrace my phone in the one and a half days I have played it. I have literally one problem and it isn‚Äôt even serious! I would LOVE gamepad support on this game because playing on mobile is a bit hard for me seeing as I am used to using a controller and KBM for some games my laptop can run. But other than that this game seems to be quite phenomenal.",5
"Before I get to the problems I‚Äôd like to point out that this is an amazing game great story and great art. However there are many things that need fixed. First off I can‚Äôt see the background I can see 15 meters in front of me but the rest is just black.
Second poor battery usage just from going into the game and playing it for three minutes it went from 90 percent to 28 percent now I have an iPhone 6s so idk if it‚Äôs just me . And finally the lag it takes 90 seconds to load a slime and 3 minutes to get to the next area.
Overall a good game but it‚Äôs unpolished in the mobile app.",3
"I have a fully-updated iPhone 6S which, according to the info should make this fully compatible on my phone. It is not. As soon as I try to do much as even load the game, it crashes. 

I‚Äôm able to get it working, at lowest resolution and fastest graphics, on my computer... for five minutes at a time before continuously crashing there, too. So apparently, it‚Äôs just an optimization thing. As someone who can run 3D games like Valkyrie Connect on my phone and games like Dark Souls and FFXIV on my computer regardless, this is honestly ridiculous. If you don‚Äôt have a PS4, you may be locked out from enjoying this entirely. Which is a real shame! It‚Äôs super pretty and fun during those five-minute increments I can play",1
"I love Genshin Impact, but I am not able to download it on iPad. It takes up 30 gigabytes! (Like, why?!)

But it is an awesome game! I downloaded it on phone and the stories are really detailed and very interesting. The characters are really cool and has very amazing abilities (including Tighnari, Keqing, Rosaria, and e.t.c) The nations are really interesting because it is very beautiful and very large! (Including the Inazuma, Sumeru, Monstadt and Liyue) They also have very unique names (like Zhongli, Baal, Nahida (Kusinali), Focalor (which is going the be the upcoming hydro archon), and Venti.

But yes, I do have some suggestions for the game.

1. MAKE IT TAKE UP LESS STORAGE!! 
2. Add more nations, including a cryo, pryo, and hydro. (Well yes you are gonna add Fontaine which is a hydro nation.)
3. ADD MORE CHARACTERS! 
4. Make the quests a bit easier. I literally cannot unlock the Inazuma because of Danesleif!

Please and Thank You!",4
This game keeps me up way longer than it should. The gameplay is easy to follow and beautiful at that. The artistry behind the scenery makes it feel like a game from a console. The controls were easy to figure out. This game is just challenging enough that it isn‚Äôt frustrating to play. Which I really enjoy. This takes the best things from Zelda and Final Fantasy and blends them into a beautiful seamless game. One in which your able to emerge yourself throughly.,5
"This game is amazing and I‚Äôm still baffled that a game so beautiful can be on mobile. If you‚Äôre even thinking about playing this game do it. I have picked it up and simply can‚Äôt put it down. The art is amazing, this story is good, the characters are funny and very engaging, the combat is well put together as well, I can spend hours just exploring the huge world itself and never get bored, and Paimon is something for sure lol. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",5
"First off I love this game and the creators too. I even went as far as to download HoYoLAB so I can keep track of everything. The graphics are amazing the gameplay is great and the story is compelling. But I have one little concern. I really think we should be able to have the same account on different servers. I had to start from the beginning to play with my friends on the Asia server. So it‚Äôs just a thought.

                       -a player",5
"Genshin Impact is definitely something I play on the daily, I highly reccomend the game. But a few things you should know before downloading is: Each update takes a ton of storage data, the game itself is 13GB of data. Primogems are the way to unlocking new characters, 160 primo can get you one wish, 1680 can get you a 10 pull. The pity system for the wishes is horrible, so I dont reccomend spending money until you have atleast 60-80 pity. Other than that its a pretty good game.",4
"Sir, you said you only had ‚ÄúOne Major Problem- Three Times! Each presenting a different issue that you don‚Äôt like or understand why developers aren‚Äôt working at your pace of ‚ÄúRocket Scientist!‚Äù You did however say a few kind words in-between the nibbling gripes, and left a good clue for NUBES like me. But if not for my passion to learn something in order to learn about someone, I would have read your review and Bailed! 
‚ÄúWhat do you gain out of that end result Young Penguin-Wahn!?",5
"Hi developer(s), I have a quick question. Is my game supposed to be as glitchy and laggy as it is? Because if I set the graphic quality to ‚Äúmedium‚Äù it‚Äôs still overclocked. Why though? Is there anything I can do, or any mobile/pc devices that work better for the game? I just want to have a good gaming experience, but it‚Äôs not easy with the way the game is working for my iPad. It‚Äôs a beautiful game and all, its just really laggy and glitchy. Thanks!",5
"As said in the title i think this is an awesome game, but i have an old ipad, which makes it bug out a TON, but it‚Äôs mostly just that. The graphics are AMAZING even on the lowest level, the storytelling is great, the characters are unique, etc. although there is onneee problem, (that i already sent to customer service) i didn‚Äôt get aloy, i fit all the requirements, i am way over ar 20, i play on mobile, but i didn‚Äôt get aloy, weird",5
"Looking for free games in the store I was faced with a sweet face a girl with white hair, the games art made me like it so I decided to download it, being spawned in the game end of phase 1 of 1.5, seeing a brand new world and the sun shining across the sea I fell deeply in love with the ocean, and following our little companion, with a face of awe and a wide mouth open, seeing a dragon fly above me, feeling more excited of what the adventure had in store for me. That was the beginning of my journey in that world.",5
"I love this game a lot but just a couple days ago it started acting weird.. I would be in co-op and then it would randomly freeze my game and say it reconnecting, and it never reconnects. I leave the game and reopen it but when it gets to the door I push to play the game and then my screen turns white, the only way I can fix it is if I delete the game and wait an hour for the beginner load up. I hope this problem is fixed so I could enjoy playing my game normally like I use too.",4
I honestly love this game so much I started ir because of a friend and I have been playing for a year now. I am so glad that sumeru finally came out all of the playable characters look so cool I will save up for the dendro archon I feel like deyha could‚Äôve been a little bit darker though. But other than that all of the characters are super pretty and colleis play style is so cool and unique. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is considering it,5
"You‚Äôd think with a company that has grossed more than $4 billion world wide, they‚Äôd give proper representation to the people the game is inspired by. But they don‚Äôt. When it comes to different skin tones, not only are the characters from Sumeru extremely disappointing, but characters in the other regions as well. The ratio from pale characters to darker ones is extremely noticeable. Why do we only have 2 characters with melanin? If we‚Äôre only given one brown character per region, I‚Äôm worried for Natlan if Hoyoverse continues to favor paper white characters. They have the money and resources to have more diversity but it‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm disappointed and regret spending money on this game.",1
I just think that if you're going to take the time to study different religions and cultures every character shouldn't be limited to just one color. As a POC myself its saddening to never be represented in games such as these just because my skin color is not valued. I agree that Sumeru is not representing my culture but to the people it js supposed to represent I do think that all their beautiful vibrant skin tones should be shown off. I hope that with the next few batches of characters Hoyoverse plans to release they keep this in mind that everyone needs to be represented in the right ways. I think its wrong to use peoples culture and religions in games but never give them the proper representation.,1
"with the release of sumeru right around the corner many characters have been shown, like dori, kusinali and tighnari. like all regions in game sumeru should be based off of a real area? right? like mondstadt and germany, liyue and china, inazuma and japan. sumeru is clearly supposed to be based off of the middle east. you can see it in doris design and some stereotypes portrayed in the manga. if sumeru is based off of the middle east, why are there no POC characters? why is kusinali lighter than klee and diluc? why is tighnari lighter than klee and diluc too? this is just embarrassing hoyoverse. step up your game. you only have two characters that aren‚Äôt white or east asian. hoping that these leaks actually aren‚Äôt their final designs.",1
Genshin u are the best game I have ever seen more then anything in the world but there is one problem last month I came in Genshin I asked me for email and password I did but it kept on saying account or password error still it says that I literally cried when it did not work üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ so pls try and fix it BUT ALL OTHER THINGS ARE AMAZING ü§© I LUV IT IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER I AM JUST SPEECHLESS üò∂ I LUV IT but I am rly sad that I missed all the events üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠pls fix it AND I LUV IT and it's just the game I want so yea pls fix the gameüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ù§Ô∏èüíú,5
"okay so, i used to play this game a lot, and i loved it a lot! the characters were cute and i was building up my razor :D but after a while, i deleted it since it was only taking up space and i didn‚Äôt play it anymore 

but recently, i‚Äôve been wanting to get back into the game (itto loml) and i deleted a bunch of apps and cleared out a bunch of my storage, but everytime i tried to download it, it said insufficient storage,even  when i know i have enough :( i even tried on my ipad, and it still didn‚Äôt work, idk if it‚Äôs the game or what but i‚Äôm super bummed out that that i can‚Äôt play it anymore.",2
"I love the co op option that allows u to play with friends and make new friends! There are always new quests and characters and areas to explore. The graphics are amazing, and they look even better on PC and the PS4. However, it's still a mobile game so im able to play it on my phone in between classes and during breaks. I just wish there were more variety in the daily commissions as well as better luck with the artifact farming lol",5
"I love the graphics and the story line is godly. The character development is amazing as well, but I am randomly signed out of my account without a way to re-enter meaning I have to restart every time this situation occurs. And it is extremely frustrating, especially since this is the mane game I play, meaning I have gone pretty far. It can all be gone by a small bug or glitch. But really that is my one and only complaint. It has amazing gameplay otherwise.",4
"The game is fun to play but not on your phone because you don‚Äôt really have enough space and your phone gets really hot but on iPad you have enough space to actually play the game without you device getting hot. I don‚Äôt know how the PlayStation version is going because I don‚Äôt have one, I have an Xbox and I was really hoping for the game to be on there but I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs not compatible with Xbox yet and I was asking can you guys try to make it compatible with Xbox, I really would appreciate!",4
"Genshin really is an amazing game. I‚Äôve only been playing for a few months but I love it so much! The graphics and storyline are amazing, it never gets boring. There are so many different characters that I think are really cool! One downside is that for mobile players, like myself, Genshin takes up SOOOO much space. On my iPad, which I play on I only have Genshin because I don‚Äôt have room for anymore apps with Genshin. It‚Äôs still a great game and I highly recommend it!!",5
"I absolutely admire the characters and their unique features. The world itself is stunning as well. I like the wide open world and basically everything in it. And as a fan of cooking I gotta say the cooking is satisfying although it could be better. There is something that I‚Äôd very much appreciate to be added to the game, which is the ability to make gestures/emotes. It would make the characters more lively and perfect for pictures. I look forward to what this game may contain in the future.",4
"No game is perfect, and even the best known titles have their issues that their team layer base is unhappy about. With this game, it could be the lack of rewards, or in others it‚Äôs how they portrayed characters or stories. However, this is still a beautifully designed game. The story is engaging, and the characters are memorable and easy to love. So, despite the flaws this game has, I would absolutely encourage people to pick it up and play for themselves.",5
"i love the game and all. have been playing since late February but there is something that bugs me. i hope i can speak for all mobile players as one myself but i think that Miyoho should make the size of the game smaller, otherwise sooner or later mobile players won‚Äôt be able to play anymore. the game is almost to be 20GBS and it‚Äôs the only game i can have on my phone or else i won‚Äôt have anymore storage. thank you",5
"The game is the definition of pay to win except there‚Äôs nothing to win because there‚Äôs nothing to do in this game. It takes about 30 minutes to do daily‚Äôs and then after that there‚Äôs nothing to do. Event comes every two weeks and it takes about an hour total to do the whole event. There‚Äôs nothing to play except run around and enjoy the view 

Also if you love crappy controls this is also for you. Camera moves and zooms on its own without any user input. Imagine playing a shooting game and your gun just starts firing on its own without your clicking. 

Download the game enjoy the graphics a bit and then uninstall, don‚Äôt spend a cent.",1
I love this game so much and the people who talk crap and say it‚Äôs not fair just don‚Äôt know how to play. I have played since the very beginning. I have 5 stars and haven‚Äôt spent much money on this game your luck goes with your account so if you don‚Äôt have a 5 star it‚Äôs bc of the way you poll. There is so much that goes into this game you just have to learn as you go. The game play is amazing and I love this game so much. Look up how to play the game if you are struggling!,5
"Genshin Impact is my favorite game since the day that Genshin Impact released. I love everything about this game, but something happened yesterday about this game made me disappointed. Genshin Impact one year anniversary event. This event tells me everything I've done in this game and the rewards that Genshin Impact give us are just 100 primogem which is not even enough to make 1 wish and exchange to 1 intertwined fate. This is ridiculous. Seriously, I‚Äôve been playing this game everyday and this is how I and every player got treated for the one year anniversary? I am so disappointed about this game. The rewards for the one year anniversary are literally equal nothing.",1
"With the recent negative feedback from the community Mihoyo decided to ignore everyone‚Äôs concern in regards to a certain one year event. Which I won‚Äôt call it by it‚Äôs name, since it really isn‚Äôt that ‚Äúevent.‚Äù They also promised us that a titanic tuna would be summoned when you use the Luxurious Sea-Lord on Elemental Burst. All I see is a flap of small tuna that just drops on the ground, even Magikarp is better than that. For Mihoyo 1) Give us what the community deserves 2) Listen to the community 3) Speak to the community like you did when you first launched 4) Fix the Luxurious Sea-Lord weapon, don‚Äôt change the description‚Ä¶ give us an actual titanic tuna that would slam on the mobs. Thank you",1
"The anniversary rewards are so bad. We give you millions of dollars for every character. Around 4 million dollars a character and all you give us is one ten pull. That isn‚Äôt even good, I‚Äôve been playing since 1.5 and have been having a lot of fun but it‚Äôs getting boring now the events aren‚Äôt as fun. It used to be my favorite game but now it‚Äôs just boring to the fact that I can‚Äôt even log in everyday. Do better and give us better rewards.

The quality on mobile is so bad. I‚Äôm crashing every time I do an ult. The setting say it‚Äôs smooth but it‚Äôs clearly lying I crash every time im doing a boss and the boss restarts and it gets on my nerves. Please fix this",1
Ive been playing gatchas for years and genshin since release. One thing that these game‚Äôs always maintain is a level of respect and transparency to its fanbase especially during anniversaries. Not only has mihoyo completely turned its back on all its loyal fans but it hides behind censoring and limiting those who wont take it quitely. As someone who has spent a great deal of money on this game its so upsetting to see them not care in the slightest about how poorly they treat their fans by giving the most insulting rewards of any game in history. I know it is not only myself but many others that are hurt and will not spend a dime until this is resolved and addressed. Miyoho do better.,1
"Considering the fact that they gain so much money from this game alone is cool; but the way they treat f2p players (free to play) is very sad, giving out small amount of primogems in events that are very long. The overall gameplay is nice but, they treat new characters like old characters but just make them 5*. Their anniversary is today, yet they don‚Äôt give us a big or ok amount of rewards, just do gacha for 100 primos, who knows what percentage you can have, out of all of the millions of people that play genshin only 100 (I think) get a small amount. They make a lot of money yet they gatekeep good characters too people that pay money. Please make a change in the reward system.",1
"I say this because the game has such a wide range of characters, there‚Äôs something for everyone! The storyline is incredible, and you don‚Äôt have to pay money to get new things. I do have one little issue and that is that the game downloads A LOT. But otherwise, the graphics are beautiful and the world is so big!!! Definitely recommend getting! Have a good day/night whoever is reading this! ‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üíõüíöüíôüíúüñ§ü§ç",5
"Genshin is an absolutely spectacular gacha game! It‚Äôs a tad more friendly for light spenders and whales but it definitely still works for f2p players like myself! I always find myself wrapped in the beautiful scenery and the lore is absolutely amazing. Theirs always a few bugs in games but Genshin is usually quick to listen to their fans about anything, although admittedly some items get a tad annoying but overall, it‚Äôs a very fun daily game! Even if you just do the basics and log off (commissions and resin).",4
All right I have a one problem the summoning or wishing rate it doesn‚Äôt matter if they put a 10 times rate for a four-star character on a 10 times wish you never get anything you get nothing you get the weakest thing out there it‚Äôs in fury aiding when you grind up all these primogene and then you get shafted well doing a 10 times salmon with the special offer I have spent so much time grinding the game to summon all I get are the same characters I have I have no new characters it gets annoying,4
"The game is great!! The graphics the designs and pretty much everything about it makes it a fun game!! But Purchasing Primogems is kinda insane, They cost a bit too much for as currently 50 pulls can cost you about 100$ this is insane. They should pretty much lower its prices and give more primos for the amount of money paid. But not just that, They should make it a bit easier to get more primos too though. It takes me 3 weeks to atleast get a 10 pull.",5
"i had to do a review here because it doesnt allow me on my other ipad.

this game is so amazing! i play it everyday and it is like, wow. the only thing that makes me go upset is that it crashes (i know its normal though, it just makes me rage or something). i also love how this game is the same as adventuring, but you need to do a lot of stuff in return. at the start, i felt really bad that aether/lunime disappeared and i was shocked. but other thing, THIS GAME IS THE BEST THING EVERRRR I CANT IMAGINE ANY OTHER GAME BETTER THAN IT",5
"Momoki says that this game is freaking dope but there‚Äôs one problem, mihoyo, you still owe me 600 primogem! I updated twice! Got nothing!! Also, I deleted two of my games to update this time! It doesn‚Äôt lemme play still! I wanna continue my progress already!! Fix this problem please. Also I has a request! Can you make two characters that are twins? Like, me (momoki), and my sis mimiko? Sword sisters! Lol.. that would be amazing so see some twins in the game! Thx! I hope I can get to play!",5
"Genshin is a great game and I recommend it to just about anyone! But, my biggest issue is how it runs. It only took the game two minutes to lag me out over and over and over again. If you can‚Äôt play a game then it isn‚Äôt a game. It‚Äôs very frustrating to deal with all the time. As time went on and more updates came out, the game got WORSE. I think it‚Äôs gonna get to the point where I just can‚Äôt play it anymore.. could you please try to work on some issues for mobile? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only one who has these issues..",3
"I‚Äôm genuinely surprised about the quality of this game, it‚Äôs really fun and I‚Äôve enjoyed every minute of it so far. The gameplay is great, the story is really nice, and the game looks really good. I love the character designs too. I have nothing bad to say, usually games with additional purchases are unbearable with a ton of ads and extremely hard to get in game currency, but I feel like this game is pretty reasonable on that front. I would definitely recommend this game!",5
If you are reading this then you need to get the game right now it ‚ú®amazing‚ú® and I guarantee that you are going to agree once you played the game for a few hours and yes HOURS ether way if you don‚Äôt want to you‚Äôll end doing that because when I first got this in the weekend and I spend all my weekend playing this game and I have not got a blink of sleep in those two days and I do not regret it I‚Äôm just addicted to the game and it‚Äôs just ‚ú® Beautiful ‚ú® hope you enjoy the game once you get it!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜ,5
"I am in looove with this game! I‚Äôm happy that you can change characters and stuff like that. The graphics are amazing and it never kicks me out like any other game! It‚Äôs a bit tricky at first because of the controls and stuff, but once you play it for a while, it‚Äôs not that hard! This is only my second day and I already got so many cool stuff! I really recommend this game to you. You can explore the big huge world that‚Äôs lurking beneath you!",5
"The game is super fun and I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot. The graphics are amazing for a mobile game, the gameplay is really fun and easy to get hooked on (especially since I‚Äôm a sucker for these kinds of rpgs), the characters are really lovable (and the girls are very beautiful as well ;]), and the music is very soothing to listen to. But, playing on my iPad, the game crashes every 10-20 mins and it‚Äôs very irritating because it just does it out of nowhere. I looked it up and I‚Äôm not the only one with this problem. Otherwise, the game is absolutely great and well paced.",4
"First I‚Äôm going to say for the time I‚Äôve had it this was a incredible game.

But for some reason my game won‚Äôt load when I open the app I don‚Äôt even get to a loading screen i just get slapped with a white screen and then 5 seconds later (I‚Äôve timed it) my screen goes half white and half black and then not even 5 seconds later my game crashes.

Has anybody else had this problem and have any advice on how to fix it.",5
"I‚Äôve been a long-time fan of Mihoyo‚Äôs work, especially Honkai Impact, and it genuinely pains me to see how poorly this game turned out. It looks amazing, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but mobile devices simply cannot keep up with this level of graphics. The game crashes if you open a menu. The game crashes if you use certain waypoints. The game has to be manually reopened every time you walk into the town of Monstadt, which functions as the hub world for the main game, the central hub of the first half of the story, and where you return for after each daily. The game may one day be significantly reworked and optimized for mobile, but until then, do not download it.",2
"My friend recommended this game to me and at first I didn‚Äôt pay any mind to it but I was bored one day and decided to download it, let me tell you this game is amazing and so addicting to play I could literally spend the whole day on this game. You know how some games start to get boring, well this one doesn‚Äôt. I also love the fact that it is always updating and the updates come out with new things every time. This is one of the best games I have come across I really recommend.",5
Can you add more archon quests I mean if you can‚Äôt think up anything that‚Äôs all right because I‚Äôm only rank 19 so I can‚Äôt even say hey add more stuff and can you guys make the Cyrillic regenisive easier or make all the regenisive easier because they are super hard I hope you see this and if you do please try and make them easier if not that‚Äôs ok a i can just level up but overall best game I‚Äôve ever played no wonder you guys won the editors choice and game of the year -atlasstuff,5
"Never write reviews, but this game is so amazing that I couldn‚Äôt help it! Well that is, until you get past AR 30 or so and everything dries up. Not to mention the lack of co-op (due to the resin system). In fact, now cruising past AR 35, I just sit and wait for dailies because there is literally nothing else to do. Was fun to get to this point and explore, but definitely built not built around late-game unless you plan to deposit your paycheck into the Bank of Mihoyo. I‚Äôm sure the new update(s) will be fun but will probably provide a little content before becoming the same repetitive cycle. Overall, great for the first 40-80 hours or so, but falls off hard unless you cough up real money.",2
"Hey Mihoyo wanna say that I love the game and I play it on ps4, love the atmosphere, the characters and gameplay, but I wanted to ask is there a way that I can transfer my data from PlayStation to mobile because there are times that I would like to play but there‚Äôs times that I can‚Äôt go on PlayStation and would like to continue on mobile without starting all over again. If so that would help a lot and would be able to enjoy genshin impact on the go, please let me know.~",5
"It is a good game whether people disagree or not. I do not experience lag like others, but it does tend to go in slow more for a few seconds sometimes which I don‚Äôt mind at all. All the mobile players have to remind themselves that this game is also a PC game. All love the story and I tend to play for hours trying to level up and find out what happens next. I love this game and I can‚Äôt wait for updates for the new main story mode. ;)",5
"I don‚Äôt just hand out 5 stars and I hate reviewing things but this game is special and it deserves the 5 stars you won‚Äôt regret playing it the gameplay is so smooth and relaxing for mobile and pc I have not played any other games nor thought of any other games in a while

Update : as I get further in the game I see the greediness in the summoning it‚Äôs rough for a free to play to get amazing characters and even as I put money into it I get crap characters even with the petty system of (90) summons I just put 200 in and still didn‚Äôt get the banner character so if your willing to pay more then that for a character you like then play",2
"I already played this game, and decided to play it again, I did not expect to see the most interesting thing in any game in history, which was.... a white screen. There truly is no game on that, I decided to download  it again, which solved nothing.. I know the game behind this white screen is really fun, but there is no game to see there, only bage memories of what used to be the game I liked the most. Is short, but by the time you are reading this, I‚Äôm probably playing the game I used to know normally.",5
A lot of people complaining about the low pull rates.     You‚Äôll get a 5* after 90 pulls which IS attainable.   One of my kids got lucky and pulled a 5* after 6 pulls.    Makes it even better when you DO get one.    No 5* are needed to pass anything whatsoever.    Instead most people are too busy enjoying the 80+ hours of gorgeous gameplay your given for FREE to even care!   Thank you everyone who worked on this game!  Amazing!,5
"This is just the most amazing game I‚Äôve ever played hands down love the story and the texture animation  is my favorite style! Super congrats on this amazing release I‚Äôll never stop playing I‚Äôm still grinding and thinking about skipping work just to have a good 10 hour grind!!! Thanks for the opportunity to play this fantastic title I look forward to DLC! Still curious if I can link my account from ps4 to iOS so I don‚Äôt have to play 2 files,but maybe it‚Äôs a future thing! Thanks for the game again!!!",5
This game is so fun because me personally i love the game ‚ÄúThe legend of Zelda:Breath of the Wild‚Äù and i love anime so this game is the mix of both And the story is very fun I just got finished doing a Quest and I downloaded this game today and have been playing 6 hours straight and have gotten very far and it‚Äôs fun how Strong the Monsters are.I will say i don‚Äôt like the fact that you guys didn‚Äôt put a controller option for Mobile and i would really Like if you guys worked on doing that.,5
"Good and fun game! My problem is on iPad that the sky looks black and so do most of the surroundings till you walk a bit, but it‚Äôs hard for me to progress since I can‚Äôt fight the dragon since it‚Äôs in the sky I‚Äôm guessing, the cutscenes also stay on one frame and the sound glitches, but could just be my iPad‚Äôs storage. Anyways fun game! (Also, when ever I get in water and get out it‚Äôs a blinding white light to where I can‚Äôt see my character at all)",5
"I‚Äôll say this now, the gameplay and animation are wonderful! The main issues that are seen though is that when entering the game, it‚Äôs takes a while to actually get to the main screen. Once playing the game, it‚Äôs actually a bit laggy or glitching I think, and the game kicks ya out after a while. But despite‚Äôs this, it‚Äôs still an amazing game to play! I hope this game continues on for a long while!",5
"It‚Äôs not a perfect game, there‚Äôs a glitch here and there, and the game is huge so it‚Äôll take up storage. But I‚Äôve always enjoyed my time playing, for about a year and a half. I‚Äôve seen it go through many updates and gotten so excited for events. The art and character design and story is what draws me in, and the way elements react with each other is so beautiful. It‚Äôs not the game for everyone but it‚Äôs definitely got me by a grasp.",5
"This was a good game while I was able to play it I have no more storage for this game I deleted every single app file and message and photo I have on this device and I still have no storage can you guys make it cost less storage I literally don‚Äôt have pictures of my family members and dogs who died anymore and I don‚Äôt have pictures of my mom who died, no pictures of my friends who died. WHY SO MUCH STORAGE. Lower the storage needed to install files of this. I have no picture of my dead loved ones and I don‚Äôt even remember what they looked like.",3
Now it‚Äôs obvious that this game would take up tons of space so I will keep this short but I physically can‚Äôt play this game anymore because it takes up all the space on my iPad now some of it is from the system and other section but the rest is Genshin and I can‚Äôt play because I don‚Äôt have enough space. I just wanted to say this because my only solution is to get a better device that gold 64 GB instead.,5
"I love this game, I have been playing for a year but the only downside is the fandom and the fact that you have to spend money to have a better in-game experience. I have spent over $200 to be better at this game and collect more characters and the new SUMERU update with finding all the Aranara is so hard like pls make a aranara locator I beg of you Hoyoverse. Anyways I‚Äôm waiting for Nahida to come home now with no guaranteed so wish me luck and pls give me Nahida Hoyoverse!üòûü´∂",5
"This game is really amazing and I have been playing ever since it came out, then I stopped playing because it started to get boring. That's not the problem tho, the problem is that they made a character from a culture that is dark skinned but the character is not dark skinned? This is coming from a black person btw, and I hope they can add my characters with dark skin because I would totally kill for them! Other then that it's a pretty nice game! Definitely recommend! (If you have enough storage ofc, but still worth it)",3
"So to get thing started I would have rated this game 5 stars but hear me out. Ok so this game is amazing and has great quality is super fun but the problem is that I play on iPad so when a new update comes I can play it bc it take up to much space so I can‚Äôt play because the updates are to big. I understand that you wanna make the game for fun and playable for everyone but it just takes up to much space so iPad user can‚Äôt play. But other then that 
This is a great game keep up the good work.",4
"i LOVE this game but please please please if the developers see this, please add a bit of diversity it would make much more people enjoy this game and y‚Äôall would prob make more money lol. Seriously consider it please this is a great game but as a brown girl, we need more diversity plus isn‚Äôt this game based in Asia? come on man. make this game so much and just add a few darker skinned characters y‚Äôall won‚Äôt get demonetized of anything. Seriously if you see this comment think on it. Great game though I probably play it too much lol.",4
"The game lacks actual improvement in updates and fixing things the community keeps begging the dev team to pay attention to. It‚Äôs like they care more about the group with the money rather than the people wishing for the best in Genshin Impact. The current discussion about diversity in sumeru is giving me flashbacks to the 1800‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWait your turn for diversity‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a work of fiction, why are you so pressed‚Äù. Gosh. the direction this game is going isn‚Äôt a bright one. The devs won‚Äôt listen and keep doing the same stupid things. I gave up a while ago, but now I hope people see this game and the community for what it really is. Do not play this game, just another disappointment.",1
"Genshin is my top favorite game at the moment the graphics are great the story is great but there is on problem, storage it takes up a lot of storage and anytime there is an update I have to delete/offload apps etc  because how much storage it is taking up. I have seen other people complain about this too and wanting it to take up less storage. I have been wanting this to be fixed but I doubt that will happen. That‚Äôs my only complaint about it and otherwise it‚Äôs a great game",4
"This is just stupid there are almost 50 (playable) characters in this game and we only have 2 darker skinned characters?? Not even dark skinned they are tan. The lack of representation is disappointing. We need a bigger range when it comes to skin tones. We got white, pale, paler, and tan. Come on now. I would love to see a bigger range of darker skinned character 4 star AND 5 star characters. If we get more dark skinned characters some of them need to be 5 stars as well. Not only this but their backstories and character better not be stereotypical or racist. Do some research when it comes to different cultures, give us more dark skinned characters (both 4 and 5 star) then we‚Äôll be happy.",1
"I‚Äôm white, but honestly, the lack of diversity and blatant whitewashing of the few darker skinned characters is sickening. That was bad enough, but now almost all Sumeru characters will be pale? You cannot seriously just take culture from SWANA (South West Asian & North African) regions, and implement it into your game only to make almost all of them them pale skinned, when many people from SWANA regions are tan/have dark skin. You couldn‚Äôt even manage to properly represent culture from those regions, and now you‚Äôre choosing to almost completely ignore the fact that many people from those regions have tan/dark skin? That‚Äôs disgusting and we won‚Äôt stand for it. Fix this. It‚Äôs really disappointing.",1
"It started out fun, the graphics are beautiful, but the storyline and quests have way to much dialogue, and you‚Äôre not even allowed to skip it. Another annoying thing is, the amount of storage required is unbelievable. It‚Äôs almost taken up 64 gb of my storage. I will run out if you keep giving us 6-7 gb updates. The wishing system is also not fair, your rewards aren‚Äôt good, (300 primos for an almost 5 hour maintenance??) It also doesn‚Äôt seem like you care much about our problems! This is a game that I‚Äôve poured my time and devotion into, but all you guys did was steal my wallet.",2
"as you may assume i‚Äôm a teen but i have never been a video game player, or game player in general. i read and studies in my free time so it was genuinely surprising when i enjoyed this game. the characters are awesome, i can play on mobile and ps4, it gives me something to do when i‚Äôm bored of reading, especially during the summer when there is nothing to do in my small town. i definitely recommend this game for anyone needing a break from work/reality üòÇ",5
"This game runs well, the controls are easy and the landscape is beautiful. Im not a huge fan of the artstyle but I don‚Äôt mind as the combat feels rewarding so far. I‚Äôve heard the end game is quite grindy, so not looking forward to that. But definetly worth a download to play the story mode at least. Also, games usually are hit or miss with the humour and this game delivers. The writing is good! Voice acting too. Clearly a dedicated and proud studio behind the game.",5
"I love this game but there‚Äôs a few things that frustrate my friends and myself. When in dialogue, monsters can still attack and kill you, even if you‚Äôre far from them. You can‚Äôt just exit the dialogue and fight them, you have to wait. By the time you‚Äôre done your character is already dead. Also if you exit out of the game and get back on, the monsters will still attack and kill you when you‚Äôre loading and unable to play. It‚Äôs very frustrating.",4
"This game from top down is one of the best designed and executed games on any platform.  If you love open world exploration, puzzles and adventurer, you will love this game. Nearly every interaction, UI, game play and balance is p

  I haven‚Äôt payed a penny to play this and have spent a hundred hours thoroughly exploring maybe 1% of the world.  This is every bit as good as Zelda BOTW with a lot more role playing options - a lot, lot, lot more! 

The only con is that if you do want to pay extra get ahead the develop take greedmongering, like the game design, to the next level.

Give us a $20 a year option with a lot, lot, lot more perks and I might think about it.  For what the developers offer you would not get hardly anything for $20 a day.  (For $70 you get all the content in Zelda BOTW, for example)",5
"Listen, I love the game. It‚Äôs amazing. The problem is the amount of storage it takes up. If you are a person with less than 64 gb, you probably do not want this game. Even though you may be able to have enough space at the moment, the updates will take your storage. Don‚Äôt download it and get attached if you know your phone may not be able to handle it. Other than that, spectacular game.",5
"the game is ok and all wonderful graphics and gameplay but the gacha system is expensive, ive been playing for a couple days now and only got 1 multi summon cause it‚Äôs ridiculously expensive to summon in the games, you need 1600 gems to get a multi summon and that‚Äôs like $20 or so. It makes being a free to play player difficult to even get attached when you only get 10 gems per activity and no login bonus making the game a major turn off as i realize you are forced to pay money if you want to get good characters.",3
So this app says it has 3.9G of storage. but then it needs me to download stuff and it takes up 17G of storage. Why? Can you guys make it possible so that mobile players can play the game without having our device overheat? If not then fix the storage description and make it say 17G or whatever the current storage it takes up. Love the game and all but if you can't make it adjust to moble players then I'm not sure on what to do with it. I honestly might stop playing because I really don't need an app that takes up a lot of my storage.,3
Oh my God I don‚Äôt know if there are words to describe the scheme but I‚Äôm just going to say it is one of the best games I have ever played it is so detailed it is beautiful the quests are so fun it is amazing to get new characters from wishing and it is just amazing it is so fun to play with friends and you can defeat bosses and get up your adventuring and get rewards for doing commissions and you get to meet the god of anemoAnd the God of electro and the God of Geo and it is just so amazing!,5
"When I got this game, I immediately thought that the game probably overrated. However, I started playing and soon couldn‚Äôt stop. I got hopelessly addicted by the limitless ways you can customise your team based on your play style. I never ran out of things to do in Monstadt and was ecstatic when I moved on to the dramatic story of Liyue. I didn‚Äôt spend a dime on the game but still got characters with an appealing backstory. Best free game I have ever gotten my hands on.",5
The game takes up to much storage for many users. Me for instance has 32 GB and with the new update making it about 18 GB and other things taking up stuff there is no room for anything. I can not even download the new update. So I think files should be able to be out on the iCloud because when the full game comes out it is more likely to be 50 GB at this rate. So it would be better for most players.,5
Okay so I love the game but there‚Äôs one problem there‚Äôs always a lot of updates that‚Äôs good but also annoying because when I play and a update comes up I have to update or I can‚Äôt play so I think you should add a auto update like most games it‚Äôs way better and I don‚Äôt have to keep going back to the App Store to update it again and again thanks for reading this I hope you add an automatic update please and thanks,5
"I just started playing a couple days ago and I think its a pretty great game. I got this game because my friend said they think I would like it, and I did. Though what I want is Hu Tao because my friend just told me I missed her and I was crushed so I hope she will be back because she is my favorite character if possible. Other than that I love the style and play game and I will definitely still be playing. 10/10 game in my book.",5
"This game has amazing graphics, from drawing the shadows of the characters in bodies of waters to beautiful landscapes, it is really fun and relaxing. I love the background music and scenery. The only issue I have is that it forces us to download ‚Äúupdates‚Äù basically every week and it takes A LOT of space on my phone, I literally have to delete 8 apps and all my photos to be able to download the update and play the game. Otherwise, the game won‚Äôt let me in.
I appreciate that you guys are trying to improve the game but this issue makes it unplayable.",3
"This is my absolute favorite game to play. Mihoyo definitely needs to work out better ways to assist their fan base however. They do need to appreciate all the players who make the game possible. But at the same time players need to be more appreciative of the hard work that‚Äôs put into the story, art, and play style of the game. I still definitely enjoy it very much. Just hope that there will be more cooperation and understanding from the company to the players and vice versa <3",4
"I absolutely love everything about this game. the story, the art, the lore ‚Äî i hope they release a hydro pole arm user soon. 

If you are thinking of getting this game I will preface by saying that it is a gacha game ‚Äî while you are able to play the game F2P, you will have to patient this way. everything is available F2P, it just takes a little longer to progress in the game in regards to characters and artifacts but it should not hinder the playing too much.",5
This game is the best f2p game I have ever seen the game is fine and you are almost impossible to not f2p cause this game give you a lot of gem like in the fes you can get 0gem and event in this game has the best reward 0 gem all I see from the event reward is 0gem and when you stop play this game for a long time you will think this game will give you a lot of reward to let you play this game but this game is awesome they give you 0reward 0gem‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. all I want to say is this game is the best f2p game so if you are not rich you are almost impossible to get better characters and everything that cost gem,3
"A botw clone with highly predatory in game market. I would keep it away from your kids because of the gacha elements. gacha is a disease on gaming. Its a shame to ruin a game with this kind of garbage. They went way overboard with the botw art styles, game elements even the MUSIC. Its very high quality, but it feels quite on the nose to have taken so much directly from another IP. All of it combined makes it feel like a half hearted cash net rather than a work of art. I would say to pass on this one, but its still on of the better games on mobile which is unfortunately PLAGUED by gacha garbage.",3
"Soo.... miHoYo has made this game amazing but the only thing that is giving me stress is the quest, Ritou escape plan, all I need is for Ritou escape plan is at least 530 seconds, not 400, I get so much stress. Everything else is amazing, right now they ARE GIVING US 1600 PRIMO GEMSS, THANK YOU, I have such a had time not spend the primo gems. One time I had 1,400 and I said to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna spending but 1 pull, I can get keqing‚Äù BUT GUESS WHAT I USED THEM ALL SO THANK YOU MIHOYO!!!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SUPER SUPER HAPPY",5
"Genshin impact is one of the most amazing games I‚Äôve ever played and definitely deserves a 5 star rating however, one thing I don‚Äôt really like is how the game requires so much storage space every update. I‚Äôve deleted all the apps and photos I had but that still wasn‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs sad knowing I‚Äôll never be able to play this game on my tablet anymore and I‚Äôll be stuck having to play it on a phone that dies fast",5
"I really do love this game. It‚Äôs right up there with a game I‚Äôve been playing since I was a kid, Minecraft. This game can really tap into my emotions and I have come to live some of these characters. Yes, you may end up spending money and the updates can be a pain if you have low storage but I feel it‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve managed to get some of my friends into Genshin and they love it too. I‚Äôd recommend at least giving it a fair chance.",5
"I have been playing this game since it first came out on the PlayStation. I love genshin and wanted to make a second account on my iPad, but it refuses to run properly. The app will crash literally every time I open it. I downloaded it almost 7 months ago and have only been able to grind up to AR 27 because it crashes so frequently.  It‚Äôs pretty much not worth even trying to play anymore. I have 128 GB of storage, so I don‚Äôt think lack of space is the reason it runs so poorly. All I wanna do is murder hillichurls and summon for characters ‚û°Ô∏èon the go‚û°Ô∏è but it is actually impossible to even keep the game open.",2
"So let me get this straight. The game glitches, your stingy when it comes to primogems and overcharge when it comes to crystals, and many more problems. And to top it all off I can‚Äôt throughly farm anything bc of the way you have your resin situation I feel as I‚Äôm not able to get anything truly done due to the resin as a f2p at least you can to use make the ratio around 2 or 4 minutes for every resin so it‚Äôs easier it will help a lot of people play your game when you think about it honestly",4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game for 351 days and the 1 year anniversary rewards are so bad people have rated this game 1.5 stars in the Google Play store. I completely agree with those rewards. After this company makes millions off of us, they give us practically nothing as a thank you. The wishing part of the game is terrible, spending $100s of dollars to get a single character is completely absurd, the rewards for anything are terrible and barely help you in the game. If the company wants to continue this game for multiple years, maybe consider being more generous to the people who play it since we pay them and are the reason they‚Äôre doing good ü§®",1
"Genshin Impact began as a beautiful, engaging action RPG with great characters and fun team gameplay. The gacha mechanics were the worst part. But it has become far, far worse as the developers ignore existing fans and their feedback to focus on new players and new money. Mihoyo does not respect your time or your money, they will do everything they can to rob you of both. Anniversary events are a prime example of manipulating the community to try to get free advertising, and your compensation (even if you win the fan art competition) is digital cents. You could play this game casually for a few hours and then just stop. I will update this review if Mihoyo makes a change for the better.",1
"this game is amazing, from the graphics to the entire plot. It‚Äôs very well developed and there‚Äôs always new content. A lot of the genshin fans are mad because of the anniversary awards and in all fairness, I don‚Äôt like them either. Although it might not spoil us as much as other gacha games might, it‚Äôs still very active and a great time spender. Just like many other Mihoyo games, I think this is definitely worth 5 stars!",5
"Great game but they could have down better with the anniversary rewards they were not the best, but is some anniversary reward gonna make me stop playing no because there will always be more to come with this game other than some of the anniversary rewards it is a 10/10 game, great graphics and gameplay many stories and characters to play there will always be flaws and bug in games, but still genshin impact is very fun to play.",5
When I downloaded this game I was confused at first on what was going on but now I understand and I love the game. It‚Äôs so fun to fight bosses with your friends and get the characters you always wanted. Plus you could hang out with some of the npc‚Äôs if none for your friends can play. There‚Äôs always a twist or a surprise when you never saw it coming. I never thought I would be so addicted to this game. But once again it‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve ever played.,5
"This has to be my favorite game. My friends and I play it together almost daily which it makes even more fun. Aside from that, I really love the music, the character design, cutscenes, gameplay, basically everything. Even just walking around makes it really fun and peaceful with the beautiful scenery and music. I‚Äôm a Kazuha main and Inazuma just came out and it blew my mind. I 10/10 recommend you play this game if you‚Äôre thinking about it!",5
"genshin is an amazing game!! the story line is good and characters are unique and have there own talents. there are many places to explore and oceans to cross, i‚Äôm having so much fun playing with characters and I don‚Äôt want the fun to stop though the wishing system is quite intriguing; you either lose the 50/50 or dont. Anyways that‚Äôs not what the review is about even tho the title states it. I want mihoyo to address the anti blackness and weird things the players/fandom do.",5
"I love the game but when I get to ranking 25 I have to go through an entire thing and whenever I close out,like if I‚Äôm going to get a snack, it makes me do it all over again and it‚Äôs giving me a headache so it would be nice if you could change it up a bit to make it less stressful cuz like I said it‚Äôs giving me a headache and I spent like a quarter of my time getting through like 5 stages then closed out to do somthing then when I opened the game it had me start over, so if it was made easier I would like that very much, thank you.",3
"For a phone game, the voice acting, graphics, and feel of the game is overall amazing. I can spend hours playing this game. I‚Äôm not much of a phone gamer but this game makes me forget I‚Äôm playing on my phone. 
The game overall is so dynamic with loads of story lines and fun. You can spend hours just exploring the world and battling bad guys to collect items and level up your hero‚Äôs and their weapons. I just started the game and I won‚Äôt be ending any time soon!",5
"I just wanted to comment because I see so many people complaining about being f2p and how hard it is to get five star characters, but like,, thats kinda the point. the reason the characters are 5 stars is because they are strong and they wouldn‚Äôt be as special if they were easy to get. I‚Äôm at ar 55, and I have about 6 five star characters from playing and saving so much. You just have to invest time to get them.",5
"Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is a great game.  I‚Äôve seen so many ads and people playing it and it looks amazing! But, for some reason when I try to download the full package it says, ‚ÄúInsufficient storage space. Please ensure sufficient space and try again.‚Äù Even though I did that math and it should work. I don‚Äôt know if this is just a bug or what but I deleted so many pictures, text conversations, and apps to try to get this to work. I tried to exit out and re-load it but nothing is working. Please try to fix this because I know other people are having the same problem.",2
"The game is amazing and the graphics are so cool. The only problem is that I get lagging issues when scenes come on and I downloaded the full version to see the sky and water. Whenever I get to the part where I need to confront Stormterror, I just get a blank screen and I have to shoot arrows but I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm supposed to shoot since I have a blank screen. Also, the lobby screen before you go into the game is blank. I hope you guys fix this problem and thank you!",4
"For anyone who has spent countless hours playing Legend of Zelda BOTW, this is a very similar and it‚Äôs offered on your mobile. So many side quests and it‚Äôs relatively easy to catch on. 
There are glitches that are frustrating but that‚Äôs expected when it‚Äôs downsized to play on a phone. 
ONLY downfall is not being able to cut through story scenes and the annoying character voices (can be cut on through app settings though). 
Highly recommend!",5
"It‚Äôs been a good month since I emailed MiHoYo. For some reason, I‚Äôve been unable to get into my account. I emailed them with proof that it was my account, and I didn‚Äôt even get an email saying that it wasn‚Äôt enough proof. To have such a large fanbase and then leaving them to dry is kind of annoying. I had a pretty good set of characters, and I don‚Äôt know if Venti will even be able to go up for rolls again. It‚Äôs really upsetting.",5
"This is by far the most fully realized game of the genre I‚Äôve played on iOS. Truly immersive and expansive; it brings everything that you could want in a massive world package EXCEPT... the game has terrible lag issues and now crashes every 30-60 seconds (like clockwork). I‚Äôve played several missions and battles 3 times over because of these crashes and while some amount of this is fine or even expected, I can no longer even navigate within a given domain because I have to reboot the app every minute! No current updates available, no detected issues within the file. I‚Äôm at a loss. Hopefully we‚Äôll see a patch or something soon.",2
"It is a great game, there‚Äôs no denying it. 

There are some things that are really annoying, though, such as the adventure rank system. It forces the player to do side quests in order to continue the story. For me, the story of the game is way more important than the side quests, so when I‚Äôm being forced to play the side quests, the game is not as fun. I wish the developers would have the game be more like a Zelda game, in the sense that Zelda games do not force you to do side quests if you choose not to. 

This is why I leave the game a three-star review. I am not saying it is a bad game by any means, but that it could be improved upon.",3
"Been playing for a few days now. The initial download is big and takes a bit but we‚Äôll worth it. For a free game it shouldn‚Äôt be. They don‚Äôt make in app purchases mandatory they might help but they don‚Äôt seem needed. I haven‚Äôt bought any and I usually feel like I have to buy in app purchases in games. Overall a good game, story line is good and the gameplay is great. Keeps you interested and wanting to keep playing. Does take a lot of battery so be wary if you don‚Äôt have a charger nearby.",5
"I have never written a review before but I wanted to say how much I love this game. There are some bugs but I‚Äôm confident that the devs are already fixing them!  This game starts off as a Breath of the Wild clone, but it takes a life of its own!  I don‚Äôt think of it as a breath of the wild clone. I think of it as a game that found something they like and they were inspired.  You see the inspiration but there is so many things that are original.  I love the characters and story. I‚Äôm so excited when I get this on my computer ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"Please add controller support for iOS/Android. better multiplayer/ less limiting multiplayer experience. I want to do more with my friends

This is an amazing game, and an effort for a new type of gacha game that Ive been hoping for for a long time now. The PC client needs work and the controller support there is spotty.

I would so much rather be able to play on my iPad Pro with a controller as the game looks amazing and would make it ‚Äúportable for me‚Äù touch controls for a game like this on iPad DOES NOT WORK. iPad is to big to always hold. Controller support!

Also the multiplayer needs to be more inclusive (allow quests and open world chests to be gathered as a guest. Co-op story would be really nice as well.

The rates are decent, add skins for characters (purchasable with gems not another gotcha gate) . People will throw money you for this game. Please just do a tiny bit more of due diligence. And this will be the 1st  actual AAA game on mobile",4
"Gameplay, art, music is great. The biggest issue is how everything is gated behind resin, which is essentially stamina. Once you get to AR 30+, everything becomes a slog since the bosses and domains take up a ton of resin and there‚Äôs not much content left aside from bosses and domains. Unlike most gacha games, however, where stamina increases along with level, the resin cap stays the same as you level up. This means around AR 30+, you can‚Äôt do much since you the bosses take up so much stamina. This game has such great potential and is being held back by the resin system.",3
Desperately needs controller support and needs some sort of optimization or something because this game was taking up  nearly 10 gigs all by itself which is insane for a mobile game but other than that it‚Äôs a great game. Don‚Äôt play if you have a spending problem or are easily addicted in that sense because as good as this is it‚Äôs STILL a gacha game. They want you to grind and grind until you‚Äôre willing to spend money and then you‚Äôll spend more money due to the sunk cost idea.,5
"The game overall is great, I love it. Its really a great game and I have have played Honkai impact 3rd and I love that game so I knew I was gonna love this game when I heard about it. As soon as a saw game play I was like""Queen I have to play this game"". the Characters are great love the voice acting in this game and if Im being completely honest I will literally stay up till like 2 in the mourning playing this game and not get tired of it. That is what I personally think about the game.",5
"I saw this game and I was shocked! I was like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know genshin impact was on mobile‚Äù and I downloaded it and I pressed demo version and I didn‚Äôt know what that meant. So I was playing for like 30mins and then it said ‚Äúinsufficient space for full version‚Äù and I uninstalled it and waited until tomorrow afternoon, and I downloaded it again and I tried getting the full version again, and it still said insufficient space. Please fix this.",4
"I was waiting for this app to come out for 5 months. I had it preordered and everything, and the the day of the launch, I find out that it‚Äôs all buggy and black/white and everything besides the grass isn‚Äôt visible, even when i‚Äôm using a compatible phone. I‚Äôm furious, and not only that, Mihoyo never responded after I gave them screenshots of my problem after they replied. I was so hyped for this game -and now I can‚Äôt even play it. Thanks a lot.",5
"An amazing game, love having this on my iPad Pro. Truly a masterful achievement bringing this to iOS! It looks incredible, and the level of depth in the exploration is truly amazing. Great voice acting, animation and the world is breathtaking. Combat is simple yet customizable and satisfying.

This game has been heralded as free-to-play Breath of the Wild... I was skeptical of that lofty claim of course, but it truly does reach the same levels of wonder with it‚Äôs dense open world, uninhibited exploration and clever world design.

The only downside is the lack of controller support.",5
"After around a year or two of playing genshin, I have reached max adventure rank and completed every story quest. Just waiting for more story quests to come out. I made the mistake of doing every quest as soon as possible and ended up with little to no content left. But ever since inazuma came out, there has been more content. Just know that you don‚Äôt have to rush the game and really spend time enjoying it.",5
"Every game should be held to the standard of Genshin Impact, I‚Äôve been playing games on my iPad/phone since they first came out, I‚Äôm not exaggerating at all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this is THEE best game I‚Äôve ever played, I‚Äôve never played a game this fantastic and in depth! If you want an actual REAL PC GAME experience, no other game matches Genshin Impact, and ALL other games I play will be held to its standard, and I‚Äôm sure fall flat. This game makes me realize that it‚Äôs possible to creat amazing fantastic games for apple products.",5
"As someone that‚Äôs played the game for a little over a year‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not bad. It‚Äôs an enjoyable game that‚Äôs great for killing time. What‚Äôs unforgivable is that they make a new character (darker skinned) and make them worse than really any other 5 star in the game, then proceed to call her ‚Äústrong‚Äù and ‚Äúpowerful.‚Äù They showcased her burst unable to kill a hydro slime that is 20 levels lower than her‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs pyro so should be hitting the hydro slime exceptionally hard.

As a note‚Ä¶ all of the darker skinned characters are viewed by the community from mid‚Ä¶ to awful‚Ä¶ and Dehya, the newest upcoming character, is currently the laughing stock of the game.",2
"Genshin Impact is a good game and the best part is it‚Äôs not pay-to-win. Though early it does trick you when the download size is 3GB but in the game the required resources takes up 19GB totaling to 22GB, I spent 3 hours downloading it. Though my thoughts on the game are the downloading times are definitely worth it. I did experience a bug where I couldn‚Äôt choose between Lumine & Aether at the start and at defaulted to giving me Lumine.",5
"Game is exceptionally amazing, big, full, different, exciting etc. Really no need now to tell how cool it is. And there is one really annoying detail what actually moving along with bother good things in game through all game experience - unskippable, unreasonably long, unexplainable stupid dialogues. Really. If you didn‚Äôt intentionally plan them to be this way - add to every conversation ‚Äòskip‚Äô button, or some sort of answer like ‚Äògot you, let‚Äôs get to the point‚Äô, for normal players.",4
You really could add a skip button for dialogue and the storage just takes up to much it‚Äôs impossible for mobile to play which is heartbreaking that you cannot play on because of storage not being enough please listen to these reviews1. TRADING SYSTEM so much easier to get characters + more would spend to get good characters I am a player of genshin and these things are problems so I beg you to fix them and it‚Äôs not just me a lot of people think the same,4
"I love this game! It has a great storyline, it‚Äôs fun to battle, I love the events, co-oping is lots of fun, and the puzzles are fun to solve most of the time. The only problem that I have with it is diversity, it‚Äôs supposed to be a multi-cultural game but all of the characters are so pale, even the ‚Äúcolored‚Äù ones, it would be better if the skin tones were darker and if there were a lot more diverse skin tones. Other than that, if it weren‚Äôt for this game my depression would have gotten worse, it might sound silly but I‚Äôm grateful for this game.",4
"Genshin is awesome, but sometimes I wish there was more to the game once you get to a higher level. My sister just started Genshin and said that she wishes you could trade so I could help her level up her characters. I think I can agree, new players should have a chance to get better characters and items quicker, and older players can engage their time in getting characters they want, or upgrading. Just a fun idea.",5
Please update the game. I am having a lot of fun but the storyline and  characters aren‚Äôt worth some of the resources. And QoL and player feedback is ignored. I really enjoy this game. Most played game on my phone. It takes up a lot of storage.. and is there a way to not pay money to get a new Character? I can‚Äôt buy them. And I don‚Äôt know how to get the items to be able to make a wish. Thank you. Pls consider my request. I think people will agree with me with I say add more to game.,4
"I really enjoy playing this game, however, the game gets boring when you‚Äôre at a high adventure rank. Not only that, but the characters are based off of dark skin origin but they look pale as a vampire. Some of the characters are extremely problematic like dori. Dori is made up of the stereotypes and her outfit isn‚Äôt even based on the correct culture. Her outfit mainly looks like she‚Äôs from the movie Aladdin. Yun Jin is supposed to be a Chinese opera singer, but she‚Äôs wearing a Japanese Lolita dress?",5
"After one month of playing this has become one of my favorite games. It was recommended to me by a friend, until and at first I was skeptical thinking that since it was free it had to be pay to win. But that‚Äôs not the case at all, plus it‚Äôs got incredible graphics, audio, characters, and while I personally don‚Äôt care much for story the story is good too. I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues with it so far.",5
"When I first started playing, I was in love with it it was so magical and cute. It was a pretty cool game only 

Only problem was that it said I explored the whole map and told me to download the full version and when I did it would not let me play. It said my storage was full and I needed to make more space to download it. So I deleted like four apps and it still would not let me play. So I deleted eight apps in total and it still said I needed more space and would not let me play. But other wise it is a awesome game and I would still recommend it.",3
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since launch and I love it a lot, and never experienced any issues. However, I recently updated to iOS 16 and the game will run fine at first but after a while it starts to lag (presumably when my phone starts to heat up LOL). However this was never an issue for me before (even when my phone starts to heat up), so perhaps this may be an issue of optimization? I‚Äôm using iPhone XR, ios 16.0",5
"I love meeting so many amazing people and doing so many fun events and just chilling out in co-op having random conversations and crazy shenanigans. The scenery is beautiful and the characters are lovely. This game has helped me communicate and be more social irl and in game, so excited for what‚Äôs to come in the future, me, Genshin, and all of its characters have a long road ahead of us and I can‚Äôt wait to see everything it has to give me and my team‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I loved genshin for so long but the lack of any meaningful diversity is honestly disappointing. With the release of sumeru and the discovery that many characters based on historical figures and myths that were not only appropriated but subsequently sexualized and white washed many people will start to drop this game. Regions that historically have a majority of darker skinned or tan people are being represented in a game that has historically portrayed lighter skinned cultures very accurately with as little diversity as possible. Not one character in this game has curly hair, not one is darker than a tan, and with the hints that Natlan may be based on latin american cultures I have come to dread opening the game. It is really a simple fix, add more representation.",1
"I just wanted to come on here and write a review on the characters of this game. Although genshin has good aspects, like the (environment details, exploration, and lore,) there needs to be improvements made with the characters. Clearly each nation is based off certain areas of the world, and the sumeru characters are just not culturally accurate, as they are supposed to be inspired by/based off of South Asia. Very disappointed in the representation in this game. There are so many characters, and only two of them so far have a little bit of melanin. If you‚Äôre going to base Sumeru off of South Asia, make the characters have darker skin.",2
"I started the game in 2021 because a friend told me about it, iI quit like a month later because of storage. Then I downloaded it again‚Ä¶ I had more than enough storage! What did it mean by ‚ÄúyOu HavE toO liTtLe sTOrGe‚Äù. I still LOVE the game. I will be buying a pc5 soon just to play the game. Overall the storage problems its amazing. Its a classic hot anime game, with in game combat. Hence its sooooo popular, there a lot of money being made by Mihoyo. I hope i can start playing soon!",5
"Hi! I‚Äôve been playing Genshin for about a year now and currently it is my favorite game to play, I love the graphics and the storyline a lot and I think it‚Äôs a really great game to be able to connect with people and spend time on! However, I am rather upset that mihoyo has not added any black characters or characters of other races, even in places where they logically would be, like the kingdom of sumeru. The designs are cute, but the way mihoyo has handled this has been disheartening at best. Really hoping to see them expand on this topic in the future!",3
I just got the game today I was so excited ab it when I tried logging in I was see that I had the demo of it so I was updating it and I see a thing about my storage I said ok ima get rid of some games that I don‚Äôt play anymore right after getting Half of my game deleted I come back to the game and I reloading and stuff  like that and it says the same thing so I‚Äôm super confused so I start getting rid of more games more and more it‚Äôs still says storage  is full and I‚Äôm like what ?! I‚Äôm telling you please tell me what is wrong with my storage I am really mad that I didn‚Äôt get a chance to play at all  fix it please !,2
"genshin was such a fun game for me. i played it almost every day and loved pulling for five star characters. but with the recent character leaks for sumeru, i want nothing to do with this game or the terrible company behind it. something has to change. genshin has a severe lack of proper representation for characters that dont have pale white skin. kaeya and xinyan barely have any in game content and its shameful. i have no interest in sumeru anymore, and this company can be sure i wont spend a single dime unless something is done. and instead of sending out emails telling us ""leaks dont represent final game content, please be patient and wait for the final release of sumeru ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"", make actual changes. and of course not every character in the cultures sumeru is representing will have dark skin, but it isnt just dark skin we as fans want. we just want skin diversity. it is not that hard. this is a million dollar company, and the fact the people running this show cant be bothered to darken a characters skin sickens me.",1
"The mechanics in this game are wonderful and every moment I‚Äôve played of it has been great. The  scenery and graphics are incredible and the community is amazing. I have no complaints that I can list because it really is a faultless game. It is keeping me from boredom over the summer and I love everything that has been added since I started playing. Overall, genshin impact is a wonderful game. (And if ur reading this hoyoverse,  Raiden rerun plss)",5
"This game is really fun to play. I would really recommend it to someone who wants something that takes a long time because it does but you don‚Äôt have to. I love this game. But it does take up a lot of storage space. For me, at least, it takes up more than 15 GB and it takes up battery on your phone quickly if that‚Äôs where you play it. But, nonetheless, this game is amazing and very interactive and I would certainly recommend it.",4
"This game is good,but it takes up a TON of storage.I‚Äôve deleted all my apps I used to have,all my photos,and more just to get this. I remember getting it a year ago the playing the demo,it took up less storage and now I have to download the full game of it won‚Äôt let me play. But if I had enough storage I would play it. And for anyone wondering, it takes abt 3GB to download it and 16GB to play the entire game. So unless you want to delete everything or buy a completely new device, it‚Äôs practically impossible to play this game.",3
"I love this game. It is so beautiful. You can tell that the developers of this game, along with other people who helped, put so much thought and detail into every aspect of this game. The graphics   
the scenery, the music. Just about everything. If you are thinking about playing this game I would definitely recommend it! But the only issue I have with this game is the gigabytes it takes up. But, beauty does come with a price.",5
"You may encounter glitches and problems in the game, but you can restart the game. I‚Äôve played this game for so long on the PlayStation and now the phone. They gacha may be terrible, including not getting a 5 star as easily as other people can. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend you‚Äôre child playing this since Gacha is a ‚ÄúGambling addiction‚Äù and can harm them at a young age. Other than that this game is pretty well made!",5
"The game is amazing, really fun to play and well made. I haven‚Äôt played in months- maybe even a year. I‚Äôll go to log back into my account and it‚Äôll say ‚ÄúPoor quality of network‚Äù or something like that. My network if fine, I‚Äôve reset it, double checked it a million times but nothing. Even made a new password which did nothing. Miss this game, don‚Äôt know if there really is just something wrong with my internet or if it‚Äôs the game (What I think). Doesn‚Äôt need updates, I‚Äôve checked a bunch. Overall the game itself is really enjoyable.",3
"the game is really nice. the quests are interesting, though sometimes i get bored. Genshin impact isn‚Äôt really playable for my phone so i play on pc. animations for characters are amazing!! i like how all the little bosses are designs and character designs are amazinggg!! basically everything is very nice and well modeled/ designed. VAs are very nice !! realms or like places like liyue and inazuma are cool. it‚Äôs very hard to earn promos though,but it‚Äôs fine as long as i still get to play this game. overall this game is really nice!! 100% recommend",4
"I love this game, I really do, but it takes up so much space on my iPhone. I thought maybe it‚Äôd work on my iPad and it did, but it kept crashing and wouldn‚Äôt play past the loading screen. I don‚Äôt own a PC, and I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt for a very long time. But it‚Äôs sad to know that a game I started to love is unplayable for me and for others as well. I hope the problem is soon fix and if not, I hope people can take and understand my warning. It‚Äôs truly an  amazing game, and is addicting, but it will take up all the free space and more you have on your device.",2
"It‚Äôs a wonderful game I quite enjoy it I play a lot but adventure ranking is hard my rank is constantly going down instead of up and I didn‚Äôt think it could do that‚Ä¶ Also I‚Äôm losing primos instead of gain of gaining them I had about 790 primos and lost all of them I have not gained a character in months on end and I have been waiting for gourous banner for forever :( 

Overall great game though other than some ‚Äúminor‚Äù glitches",5
"Genshin impact is a fun open world game with a very fun and interesting plot ; the fandom not so normal. The wishing system makes sense but I could have 78 pity and not get a five star : yes this is me getting mad about the fact I don‚Äôt have Hu Tao, thoma, or qiqi yet. Anyways pleaseeee make it so there‚Äôs more to do once you finish the archon quest I‚Äôve been so bored waiting for the next Nation. ALSO FOR YOUR NEW EVENTS STOP MAKING US HAVE TO FINISH WISHES - coming from someone who finished it the second it all came out",5
"I want to buy the in game currency but since I started on phone I can‚Äôt buy with PayPal on my pc even though that‚Äôs where I mainly play. I can‚Äôt purchase things on my phone it is a family account and the money wouldn‚Äôt be coming from me. On mobile the world takes too long to load, I will be walking around low res structures most of the times just shapes. Enemies won‚Äôt register I am there and I can just beat on them. Wind barriers don‚Äôt load in time and so I end up places I shouldn‚Äôt be. So I moved to PC and now I‚Äôm being punished for thinking I could play on my phone by locking me out of payment options. And now both I and Mihoyo miss out.",1
"The story is phenomenal and the characters are so much fun to use! My only complaint is the resin system, and there‚Äôs parts i could nitpick about the gacha. The resin system is horrible, 160 resin cap and it takes 8 minutes to replenish a single resin‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs awful. Unless you have fragile resin or primogems you‚Äôre willing to spend, it‚Äôs impossible to get any more resin. I cant even do 5 domains with that 160 resin. I am begging for a change in the resin system, wether it‚Äôs quicker to accumulate resin or there‚Äôs a higher cap, i dont care. I just wanna be able to do more than 5 domains a day.",3
I‚Äôve been playing Genshin Impact since almost day 1 and I won‚Äôt lie the game used to be so fun but lately the game dev became so greedy. They barely give the players any rewards. But that‚Äôs not the thing I‚Äôm annoyed about the most. In fact it‚Äôs the end game content especially for those who pays money regularly in the game. I‚Äôm talking 50$ a month on average since release. The game is so easy at this point and most of the events require you to do boring stuff such as collecting stuff or doing repetitive tasks. The only thing that‚Äôs considered hard in the game right now is the Spiral Abyss and even f2p players can clear it with ease nowadays.,1
"Everything is gacha-heavy and it‚Äôs getting exhausting. Farming rng artifacts and leveling up rng artifacts, both of which end up useless the majority of the time because the rng just so terribly rigged. The wishing system is unbearable, constantly getting the same bad characters and weapons. I‚Äôve put so many hours into grinding this game but my hard earned gems go to complete waste and my effort is meaningless. The anniversary events and rewards are a joke. Many of which are also gacha and no better than the regular rewards that we get. It‚Äôs sad how this is how devoted players are rewarded. It‚Äôs tiring me out, many others too, and I‚Äôll soon follow their leave.",1
"Giving 4 stars just cause I really love the game, but I‚Äôm afraid it will get to a point where it won‚Äôt be mobile friendly anymore. Right now I‚Äôm updating to version 2.1 and it‚Äôs been going for 1 hour and 20 minutes and only halfway done, I can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôll be when all 7 regions are out. Most players are mobile, so this makes me a bit upset for all the phone users. I‚Äôm on an iPad Pro, and it still takes a lot. Would also be really cool to have Genshin on switch one day!",4
"The visuals, characters, cutscenes, etc. are absolutely beautiful. Everything is so unique and definitely a step up from other gacha games that tend to have the same character but with slightly different retextures or features. Plus, the music is brilliant and really brings the game together. The story is great and really well put together for a gacha game in my opinion. Overall I was really blown away, would definitely recommend. :)",5
"The sheer amount of details, story, and content for a game that is free to play is outstanding. I was hesitant to pick up this game at first because I wasn‚Äôt sure how well it would run, but it runs great! The story line is interesting and I didn‚Äôt see some of the twists coming, and if you‚Äôre fully FTP, you still get a good set of good characters that if you build them right, the game is just the right amount of challenging.",5
"Hello, been playing since day 1 of this game and I‚Äôve been a long time spender as well. At first, it was great, interesting story, colorful characters, and an open-world gameplay that is just gorgeous but then the problems started to creep in. Little issues about stamina, time-gating everything, and though the gacha is just one side of the rewards, they weren‚Äôt great and started to turn bad due to having so many resources needed for each character and even more gacha to make them stronger. Company didn‚Äôt care to resolve these issues and they have been here since day 1. So, lower your expectations by like 60%",2
"Very disappointing end game content - was fun at first but now there is nothing to do and the ‚Äúevents‚Äù are barely game content and mostly just fluff. Gacha mechanics applied to too many things, makes it impossible to give your characters a decent build even after months and hundreds of dollars. The anniversary rewards are nonsense considering how much money this company made over the past year. This game doesn‚Äôt deserve any more of the players‚Äô money until they actually invest some back into the game. Switching to f2p from here on out and will probably drop off until the next region comes out - hopefully they‚Äôll clean up their act by then",1
"I love how even the npcs have personal stories, most games I play don‚Äôt give npcs any background information. The graphics are so beautiful, the city of monstadt, liyue, and inazuma are filled with colors and such. Characters have a realistic behavior as well. The traveler also develops a lot more facial features and has more character development. I also love how paimon and traveler have a special bond is almost like siblings. Keep up the good work!",5
"I have an iPad mini 2 (so this bad review is partly my fault I suppose), and I cannot get the game to download properly. That is, the original game download was so big I had to delete over 8 apps, thousands of photos, erase history and sites, offload apps, etc. Now, after spending 3 days to get the game to actually download, I get kicked out every time I attempt to open it. :(
I would like the game to be a little easier on the device but I know my iPad is a bit out dated, and this is a really well made and complex game. Any helpful updates would be appreciated!!
(I stand by this rating until then.)",2
This game is great for people that like to invest hundreds of hours in a game this game can be completely free to play or even pay to win people say that it‚Äôs hard to do somethings without good characters I personally spent $121 dollars to get Kazuha he is one of the best characters but he is a lot like the 5 star ventie also I think that they should put multiple banners other than the featured and weapon banner also there is a third one that‚Äôs ok to but in my opinion you should always go gor featured banners,4
"This is honestly such an amazing game, from amazing attention to detail, interesting plot,
and beautiful soundtrack, genshin truly is a work of art. Mihoyo has outdone themselves with this game. The artwork is truly gorgeous, each character having an interesting design and plot surrounding them. The plot gets more interesting with every story quest and keeps you involved. The music for cut scenes and over all gameplay is spectacular. I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but this game is worth it.",5
I played this at my friends house a lot so I finally downloaded it on my phone. I had a little trouble with the controls at first but then got used to it <3 I think the only problem I have with the game is with Jean because Jean keeps trying to take my mans and that is just unacceptable üòí all I ask is you remove her or at least tell her to stop trying to steal him from me ü•∞ with all love and respect this game is amazing highly recommend,5
"i dont think i have to explain much because u already know i LOVE THIS GAMEEEEE i highly recommend playing genshin if u love a good story and your into cute art stylesand characters this is the game for u! theres so many things u can do in this game and so many possibilities. Besides that the story is also very interesting, fun and it has huge plot twists! So yeah i highly recommend whoever reading this review to play the game or at least give it a try. 

p.s. future me if you got yoimiya congrats!",5
"So the game is fantastic and super addicting, but I have a problem. I‚Äôve been trying to search the web but it won‚Äôt let me change my bio in the profile. Now I‚Äôve changed it a couple times so idk if there‚Äôs a limit? But now every time I tap it nothing happens... is there a problem with game?? I tried turning off my phone then turning it back on, I tried clearing my open pages... nothings working... pls help!!",5
I love Genshin Impacts I think it‚Äôs a great game but when you roll the primogens are so expensive like for example when you have like 430 primogens and you roll one time you‚Äôll have like 220 primogens left and you only rolled one time I know the 5 star characters are suppose to be rare but I think the role should be 100 primogens or even less or whenever you complete the daily you get 160 primogens instead of 20 It‚Äôs hard for f2p to get any 5 star characters- I still do love the game and I‚Äôm very excited for hu taos arrival i‚Äôve been waiting for her for so long.,4
"I‚Äôve been playing this game since the first venti banner and unlike other games I‚Äôve never gotten tired of it! It works very well on my iPad so for the people who say it‚Äôs glitchy, it‚Äôs either your phone or wifi or something because it works just fine. This game gives me so many new characters to draw (ALBEDO AND XIAO) and plenty of ideas for oc‚Äôs and story‚Äôs! I play it all the time with my friends and cousin and it‚Äôs my favorite pastime. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!",5
The game itself is a masterpiece but i give up with the app version. I don‚Äôt delete the game or anything but if i go too long without logging in the game logs me out. EVERY TIME! This has occurred it restarts my game. I don't have the time for it and I'm not playing to restart over and over. No thank you. And before any developer asks.. did you log in Correctly?? Is your service okay? Yes. It totally is. Yes i logged in correctly. Your app just doesn‚Äôt like my phone I guess. Whats the point of using FB to log in and it just restarts the game anyways.. at this point it shouldn‚Äôt even need it if its just going to restart on me .-.,2
So I have had this game for a while now it is very fun but there is something I need help with. About a week ago I logged out of my phone‚Äôs account and whenever I log back in it keeps saying ‚ÄúPoor quality of the network‚Äù. Idk if it is a bug or if I just need to restart the wifi but I really like this game and would like to play again as soon as possible. Thank you for your help if you do find a fix.,5
"This game is trash. DO NOT get this game. It constantly crashes, it steals your money, and will ruin your life.I have fought the electro cube like 50 times in the last week and have not seen a single gladiator artifact. I have spent my whole life‚Äôs worth on Yanfei, but instead I got Noelle like 20 times. My storage is nonexistent. My device constantly over-heats. My grades are crashing. It takes ages to download and open. I am so mad, that I will end this game. I will hack everyone who plays. I will take back the money you stole from everyone. Give me Yanfei, and I might reconsider.
 
                                                                             Sincerely,
                                                                                     Xiao",1
"The graphics and music of this game are amazing, and there are sooo many things to do and quests to complete! It‚Äôs not like you finish a small quest and you complete the game. There are quests that branch off into many different things, and you‚Äôre free to go at your own pace throughout the game! The character design is amazing, and each character has different personalities and abilities and it‚Äôs so satisfying to unlock them! I definitely recommend it.",5
"I very much doubt you can fix this - but it takes up SO much storage. The game is amazing, and it runs smoothly if you put it on low graphics. It‚Äôs an amazing game, and I have got addicted. But a big problem is that is takes up so much storage, that just to download everything - I had to deleted 400+ images from my camera roll and delete and offload almost ALL my apps. This would be a wonderful PC or laptop game - but playing it on mobile takes up too much storage and time to download...",3
"I stumbled upon this gem by complete accident. Despite the initial download taking a bit longer than expected. I got hooked from the very start. The graphics and music both incredibly good. The story  and characters phenomenal. Would be a 5 if not for a bug I experienced after the recent update. After I spent prismogems for the 10 wonderlust wish, the app crashed and restarted. Despite not receiving any items or characters from the wishes, the prismogems were consumed. Aside from this recent event, it‚Äôs been a pretty solid game overall.",4
"This game I was doubtful about it at the start of my life as a Genshin Impact player. I can‚Äôt explain how much I love the game and the plot twist of the abyss order, what an amazing way to win me over to play this game. I don‚Äôt ever write reviews but I do for only games that I can not stop playing even at midnight I can‚Äôt stop playing Genshin Impact. This game has changed my gamer life in a huge way. Keep your god work going.

P.S. the one think I don‚Äôt like is how long an update takes and it loading all the new stuff",5
"It‚Äôs hard to find a free open world game, but this has so much to offer, even though I‚Äôm a free to play player, it doesn‚Äôt affect me that much because all the characters are pretty strong as long as you build them correctly. The drop rates are kinda low but since everything else is free and they need to make money somehow, I‚Äôm willing to look the other way. It‚Äôs still a cool game overall so I‚Äôm not upset. Definitely recommend!",5
The title says it all. This is the one game to rule them all. It‚Äôs a role playing game that truly emphasizes gameplay before anything else. The major theme of this game is freedom. True exploration. All the quest are fun and truly rewarding. The characters are great. The combat is amazing. Your efforts are rewarded appropriately. Some rpgs make you work hard for nothing but not this game. Cannot put into words how much you should play this game. A work of pure imagination! An absolute masterpiece! Pure love! Download it now! What are you waiting for?!,5

No detail has been overlooked in this truly immersive game. Hours of adventure or leisure lie ahead, for those who travel to Teyvat.",5
"I LOVE this game so much!! It‚Äôs incredibly impressive in every way and the characters are all so unique and fun! But the fact that the game lags so much (especially in battle) makes playing VERY FRUSTRATING at times. I‚Äôm a very patient person, but I have my limits and Genshin certainly tests them. Also, the game crashes every time I teleport. It used to be every time I teleported into a major city but now it‚Äôs. Every. Single. Time. I hope there‚Äôs a way to fix this for mobile players!

On a less serious but also important note: We should be able to pet the cats and dogs!! It‚Äôs killing me that there‚Äôs a bridge with FOUR (4) DOGS and I can‚Äôt pet even one of them :^(",1
"U made the bosses way to hard to beat and I wanna customize my character more then the gliders. Plus I‚Äôm stuck at adventure rank 25 and u need to make the adventure rank ascension more Easier for me way too hard for me to beat so I‚Äôm stuck and on the verge of uninstalling this game but I don‚Äôt want to so please fix this please the game is great but some things are too difficult for me and I can‚Äôt beat the ruin guard without being high enough so I won‚Äôt get hit as much and also the issue with the time limit, I can‚Äôt unlock the temple‚Äôs barriers within the time limit. Please answer this please.",3
"I absolutely love this game! It always has something for you to do! There are so many quests for you to go on, you can meet cool new characters, you have a really interesting storyline! What more could you ask for! I had so much fun with my first character that I decided to make another account just to use the other one! Each character has an amazing design and interesting personality! They are all so lovable! This game is going to have a special place in my heart for a long long time!",5
This has been such a great game! Very interactive with the open world and the ability to switch between heroes mid combat! Wow! Definitely rocking some Zelda Call of of the wild vibes. It‚Äôs a free game and can totally be played for free! I know several people who get 5 star hero‚Äôs early in the game without spending any money. I really love and support this game so I spend when I can. Enjoy this game but also know that it is HUGE!! I had an older phone and had to delete everything off my phone I order to play.,5
"Hi!! Honestly this game is so fun and I love playing it. The graphics, storyline, and quests are so intriguing. One thing is that the official genshin impact is full and it's really disappointing since i use discord a lot and I want to be able to talk to other people that also play genshin and make new friends. Also I really want to use the emotes!! Maybe make a rule or make it so that inactive people or people that haven't been on in forever get kicked because it's really not fair to people who want to join.",5
Its a really good game every aspect of it is amazing but theres one problem theres no rideable beast or horses you are only able to walk or teleport to a destination adding a horse or a rideable beast or being able to tame beast and ride them and use them in battle would make the game much better then it already is and i really think am not the only one that want to be able to tame horses or beast and then ride them this would make traveling more fun and faster,5
It has literally everything. It‚Äôs beautiful and interactive and has so many great qualities and features. So much to do and explore I never get bored of finding ways to navigate around how huge this world is! And the character designs are phenomenal. I‚Äôm in love with the voice acting and even am familiar with some of the English actors used! Bravo! The only thing I recommend is that you somehow create a way for us to use the controllers for pc and phone users as it would make combat much smoother in my opinion. But overall for a gacha game you don‚Äôt even need to gacha hardly and saving up for f2p is ridiculously easy. This is the best open world game to hit the stores yet!,1
"The worst mobile gaming experience ever! Game never achieved 60 FPS even with my iPad mini 5 while making it hot as sh$t... did they even optimized the game for mobile? Btw the game play is also meh. 
You think you are playing a BoW like open world game but in fact it‚Äôs another gotcha game but with the skin of Nintendo. 
You think you are free, but the game slaps a millions of limitation in your face after you get above level 15. If you wanna enjoy the game more? Open your wallet plz. 
Speaking about the gotcha. Go spend your valuable coins on some lottery ticket nearby your house. You will find a better chance to win than getting a 5 start. 
At the end, go buy some console game and enjoy. Stay away from trash game plz.",1
"You can do almost everything in this game. Domains, Bosses, Quests, Commisions and opening chests. Getting a 5 star may be kinda hard but getting the materials for the gacha is very easy. Why do y‚Äôall complain when it is only released and have a much more improvement in future updates? and people want Auto mode?!! For real?! Don‚Äôt compare it to other rip off gacha games as genshin impact is more unique than other games. Just don‚Äôt
listen to other peeps. They are just lazy.",5
"I got the iPad Pro recently and I started to download games onto it. I never really played games on iOS devices except for Pok√©mon Go, but this is amazing! The graphics are great. The characters and ways to build up your characters are enjoyable. The mechanics were a little tricky at first especially landing a hit with the bow and arrow for one of the characters, but I got used to it. I‚Äôm also a sucker for games that have ‚Äúcollectible‚Äù characters, an added bonus to the games already great features.",5
"So I‚Äôve been playing this game on my iPhone 7 and it actually runs well as long as it‚Äôs on 60 fps because on the 30 the frames drop to low I even turned the graphics to max with 60 fps and the game didn‚Äôt crash but I don‚Äôt think I should play like that on extended periods of time so I go with medium(default) settings and 60 fps but overall great game!

Btw everyone that says it doesn‚Äôt run on your 7 means that you have to turn low battery mode off and turn off lock portrait.",5
"I LOVE THIS GAME, i really love this game and it saves me from boredom but the only thing that is more annoying than farming artifacts is the pity system, I don‚Äôt want a 4 star weapon on a character banner because you already get some but it‚Äôs so freaking frustrating when a new character comes and you wish and you get a freaking weapon like it‚Äôs so annoying pls fix this when you can I just don‚Äôt really like it.",5
Genshin impact is a really fun game I started a year ago and I pretty much think it‚Äôs really fine for some reason I‚Äôm still defeating level 11 characters for some reason I only have an amber and the good the main character girl I forgot like the twin girls name but it doesn‚Äôt really matter but all I have to say is this game is really fun you guys and I I think you should get it so yeah I gave this is a five star rating credit to the creator to the game,5
"this game is therapy. this game is my life. i spend hours on this game. this game cured my introverted ways because now when i see people talk about this game i go crazy and so i have like 43 friends now- and now i get excited because anytime a new banner comes out i go crazy. (specially when it has Bennett or Heizou hehe) so yeah this game made my depression go adios. THANK YOU HOYOVERSE FOR THIS GAME üòòüòòü•∞ü•∞üíñüíñ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 

edit: make more banners with Heizou and Bennett PLEASEEEEE OMG. they‚Äôre my favorites. 4 star wise. i love my xiao and itto tho ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",5
"Hey there mihoyo, I really love this game and as of recently, I have invested a ton of time into it getting yelan up to level 70 which brings me to the point I want to make. It is almost completely impossible for me to get five star characters. I may have gotten 3 5-Star characters in recent times, but every time I wish for one, I only get a weapon. Is there even a slight chance that this problem can be tweaked just a little bit, please?",5
"Honestly I was first seeing this game on instagram. Everyone said it was beautiful, relaxing, an all around really good game to play. so I wanted to try it out and I can honestly say it didn‚Äôt disappoint me. I‚Äôve had no technical errors, it‚Äôs so cute and beautiful, and a really good game to sit back and play to pass time while I‚Äôm watching a show or listing to music. I can say it‚Äôs really worth it and I hope someone can find this review helpful",5
"This game is a ripoff of Breath of the Wild as well as World of Warcraft.  Both of those games have better stores, better fanbases, and are overall more respectable than this hunk of garbage.  The worst part about this is that it resorts to j-physics when most desperate, and when playing with two of my Christian friends it was awkward and a laughing stock.  If I remember anything from this game besides how frustratingly boring it was, is that there were too many cutscenes and too fast progression with little real progress being made (if that makes sense).  Plus battling with weak enemies doesn‚Äôt even do you much.  Play something else and save your time & money.",1
"I started Genshin in 1.3‚Ä¶ It has found me many memories and new friends. I remember the sheer excitement of getting my first five star, finding my first friend on Genshin, and especially the Archon Quest in Inazuma. I love having seen the game progress, but there are a few sloppy bits here and there. Still, I appreciate the amount of work the devs have put into this game. The community, however, isn‚Äôt as pleasant as it was before and I‚Äôm quite afraid of co-op nowadays. Overall, great game!",5
"I officially like this game and hate it it‚Äôs just that I was so far in the game and I got to sumuru and things were going great until it logged me out  and  I couldn‚Äôt get back in  and I already had a good amount of 5 stars. And I don‚Äôt even have enough storage to download the full package and that‚Äôs the only package they offer, I think that you should offer a minor package for people who have older Devices with less storage . And most off all is that the quality on older pcs and phones are terrible the game always crashes and it‚Äôs so laggy overall you have a lot of improvement to work on so get started.",1
"After playing this game for almost two years, as someone who is more interested in strength of characters instead of doing tasks or activities, I have never been more in love with what is happening in 3.0. Nilou‚Äôs dance and music was like the true descendant of the king of flower, sparkling in the complicated and attractive story line. Such Amazing! I need to spend more time immerse myself into this game now. Big step since version 2.0.",5
"I would give my heart and soul for this game man it‚Äôs just everything about the graphics the characters the way it makes you work super hard but still makes it fun the story EVERYTHING IS PERFECT if your looking for an open world Gacha game for end,ess exploration here‚Äôs your game I‚Äôve been playing for awhile and I‚Äôve barley scratched the surface of inazuma I can‚Äôt stop playing I would forget to eat if it wasn‚Äôt for my love for lunch GET IT RIGHT NOW ITS THE BEST FREE GAME EVER IF NOT BEST GAME OVERALL",5
"It's really not that hard to darken skin tone, it's purposeful in its favor of lighter characters. (Been obvious since day one.) Genshin really shouldn't be profiting off of other's cultures when they can‚Äôt even represent right. 

Racism is a very prevalent thing in the Genshin community as a whole and this debacle just showed me how really big the divide is. Representation matters and people should stop acting like it‚Äôs a silly thing to want to be accurately represented. Or at the very least have them try cause it‚Äôs not hard. I‚Äôve seen fan made skins of the new characters with darker skin tone. 

A big company could easily do the same but they lack actual hearts that make people human.",1
"Okay so hear me out. I love this game but there‚Äôs just this one stupid quest that not just me, but other people are struggling with. It is so unnecessary and I don‚Äôt even know why it was added in the game in the first place. First off trails in tianqiu is super difficult and second of all the awards are super trashy. I have been literally stuck on that one quest for over half a year already, and not just that but I can‚Äôt even go on co-op mode because I have to complete the quest. BUT HOW CAN I DO THAT IF THE QUEST IS SO DIFFICULT??
Because of that one quest I ended up quitting Genshin. Im just so tired of trying to beat trails in tianqiu. Please get rid of this dumb quest..",2
Hello (sorry if I spelled your name wrong)mihoyo when I first started the game it started off good but then I got in deeper into the game and it said a had to update full version I clicked remind later every time it popped up until I went to the start of the game and clicked begin but it would say ‚Äúerror 9907‚Äù can you please fix my game and I offloaded all my apps but it still wouldn‚Äôt work please fix my game I really wanna play it thank you,5
"This is the best game I have ever played. They have voice actors, it is a world wide exploring game, and the characters have lots of details out in to the. I have been working playing this game for a year now and I haven‚Äôt gotten 1 glitch. I normally like to play on pc. If you haven‚Äôt bought the game yet then buy it. If any of you guys hate the game then you guys be hating and don‚Äôt know what you are thinking. Paimon is the best and this game is my favorite video game",5
"I love this game to bits and I‚Äôve been playing it since just three days after it‚Äôs release, but it definitely isn‚Äôt without its faults. I‚Äôll admit one of the new characters (Nilou) is pretty well done in terms of research on her heritage, which is based on Iranian culture. But I certainly expected there to be different shades of skin tones for the new region, especially considering the region it‚Äôs based on (however ambiguous that may be). Hoyoverse can‚Äôt continue to release the single token dark skinned character. We need more variety. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a lot for the new region, just a couple more than one.",2
I love this game but the lack of care and accuracy towards SWANA cultures is very concerning. Sumeru is a region heavily inspired by Southwest Asian and North African cultures and the developers are neglecting to portray them respectfully. Every npc from Sumeru has had pale skin despite a majority of people from SWANA cultures having a darker skin tone. Where is the care and consideration that regions like Liyue and Inazuma have? They have 3 separate regions inspired by Europe and 2 separate regions inspired by East Asian countries. Sumeru is a mashup of multiple cultures and play into a lot of orientalist stereotypes. I‚Äôm very disappointed with the direction the developers are going with Sumeru and I won‚Äôt be pulling for any characters that don‚Äôt accurately portray the cultures they‚Äôre based on.,1
I want to first start off by saying that this game is my favorite of all time! But the thing I don‚Äôt like is not being able to continue on with the story quests or certain character quests because my world level is still low. it just takes a long time. The thing I would like to see improved is the dodging controls. But otherwise this is a very amazing game!,5
"I have completed all of the following quests series: Orobashi‚Äôs Legacy, Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual, and the Tatara Tales quest series, but the clouds and foul weather above Yashiori island and Kannazuka island still remain, even though I have been told multiple times through NPC dialogue that such weather is gone. I‚Äôve tried to see if I‚Äôve overlooked anything, but to my knowledge I have not. Am I missing something, or can you fix this bug if there is one? 

Sincerely, An Avid Fan.",4
"It‚Äôs a good and fun game to pass the time, when I started playing it was fun, the stories are great. But as you get further into the game, it gets harder to rank up if you‚Äôre not spending money. And being that you‚Äôre not spending money, it makes it harder to beat certain enemies (at least for me) so I usually depend on co op mode, but recently, everytime I accepted a co op request, it wouldn‚Äôt say that the person entered the world. I wait a few seconds, and nothing is happening. I even tried restarting the app, but it still happens. Please help",3
"this is one of the best open world action game i‚Äôve seen as an app. the graphics are incredible and the gameplay is immersive. my only problem is the resin system and commission rewards. if you were a f2p (free to play) player, and you started at 0 primogems, you wouldn‚Äôt have enough primogems to even make a single wish at the end of your commissions. the resin system and domain drop rate can also be improved, but other than that, awesome game :)",4
"This game is so fun to play with my friends and just to explore! This game reminds me of fairytales or anything considering like that. But there are problems. When there is a story (like the start when the twins get separated) I can‚Äôt see it and the audio is breaking out so badly. It lags the whole game. It happens all the time and I get frustrated. Also I‚Äôm not sure if there is a way to ‚Äúmake a character.‚Äù But I if there is, I would love to make myself in the game. I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm complaining to much about the game.",4
Genshin the game is great and beautiful but bro I‚Äôm so my it‚Äôs say I have to much storage and when I put in a new pass word it won‚Äôt work please fix it I think it‚Äôs just so many people are playing but please I‚Äôm crying but then when I get on my IPhone it‚Äôs will work but I can‚Äôt hear anything and I have been trying and trying to get it to work but nothing That‚Äôs why I said I‚Äôm gonna quit Genshin I‚Äôm not mad I‚Äôm just so tired of trying so yeah ü•≤üò≠üôÉüôÇ,5
"Hands down the best game I‚Äôve ever played on iPhone, possibly in general. The graphics are great even on battery saving settings, the battle mechanics are complex enough that just hitting ‚Äúb‚Äù over and over again won‚Äôt be enough for tougher battles, and the controller support with the backbone one is the icing on the cake. Looking for more games on the AppStore like this, but none come close. You have to use stadia or game pass to get a similar experience. 10/10",5
"Hey! I have been playing this game for a while now and have Qiqi, Klee, Diluc, and Kaedehara Kazuha. It‚Äôs a fun game, rather if you are free to play or pay to play. There is a diverse selection of characters and the map is not restricting at all. BUT THERE ARE SOME FLAWS. Characters. The 5 star characters are hard to get and even if you get a 5 star, you have to win the 50/50. And the majority of the characters are white. I think you should add more skin variety. Thank you for reading this",5
"I‚Äôve literally never enjoyed a game so much and get so emotionally attached to the characters in it, and I can‚Äôt wait for sumeru to come to the game :D Also I Recently Saw ‚ÄúThe Chasm‚Äù inside of the boundaries in the game and idk if it‚Äôs new or a glitch but I love anything new that comes to the game ^^ I also really hope there will be more than 2 reruns because I would really like to get zhongli, ganyu, and Hu Tao! And Xiao if he doesn‚Äôt come home when his banner comes back out :]",5
"The character‚Äôs and graphics are amazing. It has a very fun story to follow along with. The characters backstory s are fun to watch and learn, there designs are to. The voice-lines are great, so are the voice-actors. I would recommend this game.

Though when I play the long beginning story part it is very glitch and I have to tap the home button and re-login just for 5 extra seconds. Other then that I love the game, my favorite character is venti :).",5
"so I download this game wanting to play because I've heard about it before and wanted to get into this kinda stuff. I download the game which was 3GB so it took a while. then I make an account, sign in and think I'm gonna play but instead have to update the game. so I download another couple GB update. then when I open the game again it has to install another update in the game intself. so finally. It downloads that and loads everything else and gives me the beautiful start button. I click and I'm greeted by a prompt telling me Im only playing a demo and need to download ANOTHER 10GBs FOR THE ACTUAL GAME.",2
"It‚Äôs challenging but in a good way. Always something to do and always ways to improve.  The graphics are incredible and adorable, but cool. As a free to play player i spend no money and still have many characters even a 5 star named eula. I have quite a few 4 star weapons. I even managed to grab 2 5 star weapons. And again i‚Äôm free to play so technically I‚Äôm in a disadvantage to some players. But it never feels like that. I truly and honestly love this game.",5
Genshin impact is my favorite game I have on my phone!!üòÄ but my problem is that after I play the game for like 10 to 20 minutes the game crashes. My sisters play this game too and it happens to them. I just hope that you can fix this on a close to now update. Again this game is very fun and I enjoy playing it. so do my sisters. the art looks amazing and so does everything about it. God bless you guys!!üò∏,5
"the star is solely for how gorgeous and fun the game was in the beginning few months, but the lack of communication with the community and lack of quality of life changes and updates that everyone‚Äôs been asking for since the release is quite frankly disgusting. not to mention the anniversary rewards situation is just plain greedy. this company has made millions off of this game, would it really be such an issue to give us better rewards? the writing has improved, but at a detriment to the player base. do better, mihoyo, i‚Äôve been playing this game for over 300 days, i‚Äôve put money into it, i love and care about how it will turn out, these characters and this story is important to me. please, do something for the people who have supported you",5
"I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game (more than I should have) and for a little while I felt justified, I was supporting a a company that had produced a great game and cared about their fan base, but recently it seems like they care more about making a profit that showing their fans how much we mean to them. Just feels like we‚Äôre just numbers and stats to them. I‚Äôm in the end game now and there isn‚Äôt much to do. My advice, play with the F2P characters and get through the story, it‚Äôs really good, but late game is a waste of time unless you want to grind endlessly for a corporation that doesn‚Äôt care about you.",2
"Back when I first started playing Genshin I wasn‚Äôt aware of Mihoyo‚Äôs greed, I played and sunk through all of the content this game has to offer. I‚Äôm currently sitting at 55 AR, sunk some money in the game as well. But recently many people in the community including content creators are starting to feel burnt out by the kind of content being released. It‚Äôs as if the game is no longer tailored to it‚Äôs long lasting fans and is more focused on those newer to mid game players getting all the content from start to finish. I will still play this game, but I hope more and better content comes out for players that want more of a challenge and give us more of a reason to grind.",1
"I was extremely disappointed with the anniversary rewards as how little it gave even though mihoyo has made way more than millions of dollars off it‚Äôs fans yet all we get is a mere 10 wishes recycled from the lantern rite event from the past. I was expecting it maybe to be Adventure Rank locked so more people who‚Äôve actually been playing for a while can receive these rewards and maybe a free standard banner 5*. I‚Äôd be happy with 50 intertwined as well. Yet MIHOYO gave what‚Äôs equal to nothing to their fans, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt their business to give better rewards to their fans and I completely understand why the fandom is angry. Fix this Genshin Impact.",1
As with any game there are some cons here an there but that is what the updates are for. My only real complaint is that I wish they would really test out the new content more before dropping it to the gamers. Some new quests can not be completed because of glitches with inventory and etc. otherwise a very amazing open world game. Have been recommending it to everyone. I also only play on my iPhone at the moment,5
I love this game SO MUCH that on the 8 hours to Florida I played it. The device that works well the most for me is the IPad Air. The question for me is when are the new characters going to be in the game? That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm literally so excited for the new characters! Is Niggaungg a hidden 5 star character or just a 4 star? That‚Äôs because people are saying that she‚Äôs a ‚ÄúHidden 5 star‚Äù I really think she‚Äôs not but if she‚Äôs is or not she my favorite.,5
"Mobile games are known for being pretty ****, but Genshin delivers on everything it promises. While it‚Äôs not as smooth and refined as its PC port, it is stellar for being a mobile game.

If you want most of the event characters or a max constellation prepare to spend a chunk of cash or wait for 4-6 re-releases in order to save up naturally. However, its pity system makes the gacha balanced for F2P and all characters can become ‚Äúbusted‚Äù with enough love and attention.

The map and graphics are top notch and the storyline is sooooooooooo good. It adheres to an anime inspiration and the regions reflect various cultures.

The events are also fairly frequent and filled with rewards and goodies. Every time I miss one I always find myself regretting taking that short break.

Overall, 10 out of 10!",5
"Both mobile and on pc this game has proven to be a more fun version of breath of the wild for me and it‚Äôs free. The gatcha aspect is fun too (although I wish there was more for ftp players)!

Only complaint is how large the map is and how slow I feel traversing it. The teleporting is cool and all but I just wish I had a mount or something to truly fly around the beautiful map or maybe a horse to traverse the gorgeous countrysides.

Food for thought ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
"I love genshin impact with all my heart, and it‚Äôs so much fun to play co-op. One thing that I really hate is how boring the game gets after you can‚Äôt do anything else. There‚Äôs nothing to do except build your characters, and you need resin to do that, which takes forever. 8 minutes just for one slot of resin to come back? Not to mention it‚Äôs gone so quickly, bosses take 40 and domains take 20. I would use fragile resin, but that‚Äôs also gone so quickly and it‚Äôs so hard to get. Overall, it‚Äôs a fun game just fix the resin system, please.",4
I re-downloaded the game on my iphone and it was updated so that it would not download fast but I don‚Äôt understand because it was updated to download fast for the full package but when I downloaded the full package it did not download faster and when I was on my iPad downloading the game it downloaded the full package very fast in about a minute or two now on my phone it‚Äôs taking an hour maybe two.,5
"Now I may only be on the wind glider part and may only be level 8, but the game is amazing. The story‚Äôs are great to, the items in it help a lot especially when you need more health! The pills to get characters are great as-well, each character has a purpose when you come across them which is great. Everything has dialog and amazing movements. The updates on the game are great to! I never knew I could get so into a game before.",5
"I recommend it, especially if your looking for an action packed game. There‚Äôs a lot of things I‚Äôve done and I love how you can add friends and play/message with them. 10/10 recommend. One problem is it doesn‚Äôt load quickly, I‚Äôm fine with it since the longest I‚Äôve needed to wait is 2-ish minutes. Still recommend though. Just if you don‚Äôt like waiting a bit to get in then you might wanna think about it, idk.",5
"This reminds me a lot of Black Desert on PC. The graphics are amazing, There isn‚Äôt a excessive amount of ads if none!! The gameplay has been really thought out and there IS SO MUCH TO DO!!! I love it. This has to be the best Mobil game I‚Äôve ever played. I do hope that in future updates the world will open up more. 
A suggestion I might add, would be to have a trading system for the npc‚Äôs. I have a lot of built up junk and food and being able to sell it would be nice rather than junking it.",5
"I have an iPhone 8, this game makes my phone overheating and for some odd reason it presses buttons occasionally with my fingers being on the screen and the app often crashes a lot, I‚Äôve been trying to play it on my laptop but since I have a low end laptop I can‚Äôt adjust the graphics options unless I‚Äôm in-game I need to be able to adjust them from the main menu, since I cant even load it up. Once again great game but I can‚Äôt help but just to say that this should be in beta.",4
"The graphics of the game are phenomenal, and the voice acting makes the game feel so much more real! The fact that the game is FREE and I‚Äôve never experienced an ad is amazing, plus you don‚Äôt see the game flooding with purchases to make. I‚Äôve never played a game with such amazing graphics, and I‚Äôve never once experienced any lag while playing. I love that it gives you the freedom of exploring the land on your own, but also in quests. Overall a phenomenal game, 10/10 would recommend",5
i love this game so much you never run out of things to do you can play with friends complete quest i have no idea why this game is free they could have been billionaires if it wasn‚Äôt free people would pay 20 dollars each to play the game and prob more it‚Äôs so good this is the only game i would be willing to spend my money on me and my friend play it everyday i love this game so much 100% recommend downloading it for sure you will not regret it and if you stop playing for a while something just pulls you back to playing it again and i have never kept playing a game this long before i love this game so much it will always hold a place in my childhood now thank you creatures of genshin i would write more but my fingers hurt but like download the game you won‚Äôt regret it,5
"This is is so fun is way to good for me even to explain and the details of this is is flicking good i am very impressed with this game i had a little problem with the game but i found what was wrong i love this game is detailed, unique, fun plus not every body play‚Äôs the same way you do that's why this game is even better then any other game i ever played i hope u can make this game even better and I'm still not as good but i can tell this is quite wonderful already",5
"This game is incredibly fun and has a lot of content, the only problem is that the rates for 5 stars are incredibly bad and you could drop and lot of money and still not get what you want. The resin system is also really predatory. I feel like you should try to increase the amount of primogems we get. Otherwise, it is a very good game with pretty nice battles and really good graphics and animations. Plus the character design is really good as well.",5
"An amazing game, one of the best mobile games, and to top it off it‚Äôs free. A storyline that is captivating, and combat that os the perfect balance of easy and extremely difficult. The amount of exploration is endless, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt to explore, since there is so much and not a huge difficult spike. The game rewards you for exploring and trying random stuff out. The design is just beautiful. There is one game-breaking glitch though. You can‚Äôt pet the dogs or cats. I mean what‚Äôs the point of finding new towns if you can‚Äôt pet the animals there. The only interaction is to hit them. All you‚Äôre teaching is that animals are enemies, especially to people who have never seen a dog or cat. Absolute tyranny. Oh also the game crashes a lot.",1
"I just started playing this game, and I am absolutely adoring it,  Everything about this game is great. The characters are fun, the dialogue is fluid and realistic, and the music is amazing. This game is easy to pick up, yet impossible to put down. The fighting is fun and addictive, the open-world is beautiful and fulfilling, and the leveling system is balanced perfectly. And the best part is, it doesn‚Äôt require any in-app purchases, You could 100% beat this game without ever spending a dime on it. Overall, it‚Äôs probably one of my all-time favorite mobile games.",4
I just downloaded this game to play but when I finished downloading it and went in to play it it wouldn't open the game it had this black and white half screen thing and for a second of being in the screen it laged me out. I tried deleting the game and reinstalling it but it never worked. And also tried powering of my iPhone and it still has the half black and white screen thing. Please fix this so I can play the game.,5
"In the beginning when I first open the app it was just white. I uninstalled it twice and the game finally loaded. Now I‚Äôm at the intro and I see the cut scene and they tell me to pick one of the two but it was just a black screen with two buttons. Thankfully I picked the character I liked without seeing anything. Then when I started exploring the world, it was black on my left side. I approached it and it said it was wet. This was beach or ocean but I could not see it at all. I could only see land. I couldn‚Äôt see sky. I want to continue this game but this glitch or black graphic thing is making it less enjoyable.",2
"Really fun game, easy to understand and get into if you‚Äôre not use to playing RPGs or open world. I know it just launched not too long ago, but they really need to fix the excessive crashing, gameplay freezes, and the animation cut scenes (which is super laggy and doesn‚Äôt animate at all, just freezes while the audio still plays). I hope they patch up the lag and animation soon but other than that, its a fun little game to get addicted to. Another suggestion would be maybe to make the joystick a little bigger? Or at least have to the option to make it bigger",3
"This is a good start to what could be a great game. The sound and visual design are both excellent. Character/account progression is (mostly) fun, and I‚Äôm interested to see what‚Äôre the story will go. That said there is room for improvement. Adding controller support would vastly improve this game. I‚Äôd like to play this on my phone/tablet, but the touch controls are clunky. The gacha system could also use an overhaul. Currently the rates are too low for how expensive summoning currency is. I‚Äôm enjoying the game and I hope it gets better in time. I will revisit this review as changes are made.",3
"Look. If we're being honest, you will probably enjoy the characters you can get through gacha more than the free characters. You CAN get these characters without paying. Also, the free characters are completely viable for all content! You don't have to pay to access any part of this vast world, and boy is it huge! You'll get many, many hours of enjoyment out of this for FREE!

Don't miss this fantastic gem of a game just for fear of having to pay at some point. You won't regret it.",5
"This is a truly marvelous game with great graphics! The concept is amazing, and it‚Äôs cool having to save up wishes to get certain characters! I have one complaint. On PC, the sand in Sumeru has so much detail and quality, but on mobile, it‚Äôs just footprints. It‚Äôs bothersome, and I really was looking forward to this detail. Thanks! Please don‚Äôt see me as a perfectionist, I am a game designer who loves quality games and this just made me feel a little bit ticked!",5
I want to suggest that on banners you give the user the option of moving on to the next banner. I was trying to pull for the wanderer and sadly lost my 50/50 I I didn't have the chance to try again and it honestly made me so upset I kinda cried and it's just upsetting because I wasn't given the option to keep pulling on that banner I was forced to update it.,5
"If you like the game, don‚Äôt take out what Elliot did on the developers. His actions were not related to Genshin Impact, especially the character Tighnari himself. Hoyoverse has said that they will get a new VA. Any victims of his, may God bless you and I wish you peace and recovery.

The game itself is beautiful, and it can really only get better. Great scenery, characters, and storyline. I‚Äôve been playing for a year now and I am so excited to see what comes next.",5
